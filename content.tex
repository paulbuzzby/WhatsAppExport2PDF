\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah it’s me, I phoned it when you put your number in.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hello!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hello :grinning-face:\\
So, when are you free?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think I could do Thursday?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thursday is a good for me. Dinner?\\
I assume far to short notice to suggest tonight?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I definitely like food!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Unfortunately I already have plans for today\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Do you live in Wycombe?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I'd thought you'd be busy but it never hurts to ask.\\
Yeah, I live near Hughenden park. Its ones of the reasons I go to Titan's. Its the closest.\\I'll have a think about where for Thursday then\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Definitely doesn't hurt to ask\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Titans is literally the closest to me by miles :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\section*{Sunday $12\textsuperscript{th}$}
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Up to much today? <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m intrigued to hear how \/ why work is going so bad.\\
The better question would be what should I be doing today. Got loads of stuff I could \/ should do  (Uni work, craft show prep, robot building, house project) but the reality is I’ll probably have a quiet day and play some games with a friend. Then just get stuck in during the week.\\How about you? I’d guess marking \/ lesson planning for the week.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's nothing special, just too big of a workload on top of too many demands..\\
Well, yes. But very much the same question. I'm just on my way back from Oxford after having breakfast with a friend. Should probs do a food shop on the way back and then definitely some work. Whether I'd do more than just get home and chill is a different Q\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sundays are meant to be a rest day. Food shopping is one of my most hated tasks. I just get it delivered now.\\
As long as the minimum amount of work is done your all sorted.\\I found that sometimes if you leave work long enough it doesn’t need to be done. The trick is working out what work that is.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I love food shopping. Hate every other kind of shopping, but I don't think I can go today and face the Sunday crowds.\\

Unfortunately the minimum doesn't always work in teaching. It'll be fine, I'll survive.\\What games are you playing with your friend?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You can definitely switch, or learn to switch, from anxious to secure.\\

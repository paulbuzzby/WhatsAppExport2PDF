    <font name='Helvetica-Bold'>Paul Busby</font>: Harro Looking forward to meeting and working with you all. For the
    last X years I have been a secondary school language teacher and am Joint JJ for a change in careers. Prior to be a
    teacher I have worked with nuclear energy and <insert something else>. Original born in Slovakia but have lived in
        the uk for the past X years but also lived in France and X. Teaching didn\u2019t leave a lot of room for free
        time but when I can I like to lift heavy things in the gym, run with a local club and partake in parkrun,
        crochet including a recent <some word) into making stuffed animals, love cooking, obsessed with murder and
            serial killers. So don\u2019t try and kill me as I know how to stop you. Really into any sort of witchy
            shit. I live with my 3 year old cat Spud (attach picture) who gives me death stares if he gets fed late.
            Obviously needs some editing <font name='Symbola'>\U0001f602</font>

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Messages and calls are end-to-end encrypted. No one outside of this chat, not even WhatsApp, can read or listen to them.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Paul?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah it’s me, I phoned it when you put your number in.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hello!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hello :grinning-face:\\
So, when are you free?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think I could do Thursday?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thursday is a good for me. Dinner?\\
I assume far to short notice to suggest tonight?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I definitely like food!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Unfortunately I already have plans for today\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Do you live in Wycombe?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I'd thought you'd be busy but it never hurts to ask.\\
Yeah, I live near Hughenden park. Its ones of the reasons I go to Titan's. Its the closest.\\I'll have a think about where for Thursday then\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Definitely doesn't hurt to ask\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Titans is literally the closest to me by miles :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okie doke. Look forward to hearing what you pick\\
\section*{Sunday $12\textsuperscript{th}$}
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hey, for Thursday how about the Giggling Squid in Marlow for 7pm? I could pick you up if you like or meet you there.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How did you know Thai was my favourite?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It sounds brilliant!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I'd like to say I knew but a lucky guess on my part. Great. I'm looking forward to it. Let me know if you would like a pick up.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well that was a very good guess!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll make my way there - god know how work is going to play out\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Up to much today? <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m intrigued to hear how \/ why work is going so bad.\\
The better question would be what should I be doing today. Got loads of stuff I could \/ should do  (Uni work, craft show prep, robot building, house project) but the reality is I’ll probably have a quiet day and play some games with a friend. Then just get stuck in during the week.\\How about you? I’d guess marking \/ lesson planning for the week.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's nothing special, just too big of a workload on top of too many demands..\\
Well, yes. But very much the same question. I'm just on my way back from Oxford after having breakfast with a friend. Should probs do a food shop on the way back and then definitely some work. Whether I'd do more than just get home and chill is a different Q\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sundays are meant to be a rest day. Food shopping is one of my most hated tasks. I just get it delivered now.\\
As long as the minimum amount of work is done your all sorted.\\I found that sometimes if you leave work long enough it doesn’t need to be done. The trick is working out what work that is.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I love food shopping. Hate every other kind of shopping, but I don't think I can go today and face the Sunday crowds.\\
Unfortunately the minimum doesn't always work in teaching. It'll be fine, I'll survive.\\What games are you playing with your friend?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s really the bit that ruins shopping. The other people on the way. Why old people shop at the weekend I do not know. Although I have to be carful as I’m one of those people who should also only shop during the week.\\
Yeah, I guess it need to be max effort and it’s not like you can just delay stuff because something went wrong or got in the way. The timeline doesn’t change and is always moving. I think of it as an unstoppable train and you just have to hang on. That’s been the biggest change for me going back to uni.\\Erm, at the moment I play COD but some of their more niche game modes. If you really want the full breakdown I can explain on Thursday :face-with-tears-of-joy:. My friend and I aren’t very good and it’s sort of funny and frustrating all at the same time.\\Do you game? (I can guess the answer)\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What's your guess for that last question??\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Damn, I set myself up for that one. I’d guess no. Purely because hardly anyone I know plays video games. It’s the biggest entertainment industry but you almost have to keep it a secret from people.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh you should definitely shop during the week :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
I'm probably just going to go tomorrow after work. Might have a nap instead :woman-shrugging-light-skin-tone:\\Yeah very good analysis there..\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You know what happens when you assume?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm more of a first person shooter kinda girl, rather than co-op games - assassin's creed, hitman, resident evil and such.... But I haven't played for a while.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well, aren’t you full of surprises.\\
I could never get on with assassins creed. Hitman is cool but I’m rubbish. Have seen people speed run it and it’s insane. I get to scared to play resident evil.\\Team FPS’s are my go to\\A nap is always a good “go to”\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aren't I just! :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The closer I get to Wycombe, the more nap I feel\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, did you get the train to Oxford?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I did. Not the biggest fan of all the one way streets in the centre\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s probably one of those rare occasions where the train is actually easier than driving.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I think so. If I go to my friend's house I usually drive because I can park there but if I'm going centre I always train it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also craft shop prep? Robot building?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah. I gotta keep a few secrets until Thursday but in short. I’m a lot cooler than you already though I am.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahahahaha\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm intrigued\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I do know about the bottle stoppers (?)\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Who blabbed? (Probably me) but yeah. I make things, that got me involved in an art group. Which I think is a funny story. Then what happens when you start making things is you have loads of stuff so you try selling them and you fall down a rabbit hole. The bottle stoppers were my first attempt at making someone specifically for sale. Couple of years ago everyone wanted them. Demand has dropped a bit since.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, you did.\\
Yeah, these days people just go through the whole bottle in one go I guess. I'm guessing you've made some other bits since?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s sort of the joke I make when people see them as the vacuum stoppers are much better. I call them functional art. This people like the idea of buying stuff but they also want to pretend it has a purpose as well. I’ve done light pulls but people don’t have string lights anymore. I’d like to do coasters with the pencils but cannot find a consistent way to make them fast enough. I’ve made loads of other stuff just out of wood.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've never bought a bottle stopper but I guess I wouldn't be the target demographic. But I do have a string light!!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Noted.\\
So, you’ve never had wine left over…\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't drink....\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh, that will do it.\\
I hardly drink at all now. I’d much rather be functional the next day and get stuff done.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I stopped for medical reasons but never really drank loads before anyway. But I do miss Bailey's and mulled wine.\\
BUT I just made myself some nonalcoholic mulled wine and started on my yearly terrible Christmas rom coms traditional watching.\\How's the game going?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I'm hoping that you mean those drinks separately and not mixed together.\\
I'm afraid to ask further question about this tradition but, is it a set list of movies or just Christmas themed ones. The one that jumps to mind is love actually and obviously Die Hard is the best Christmas movie.\\I'm also assuming your birthday isn't anywhere near Christmas if your already doing Christmas themed things.\\Either way a much better way to spend the afternoon than working.\\We have just stopped. Very lack luster. Trying out the new zombies game mode. 4 games crashed 3 times, had to restart twice. So not the best start but it has potential. Annoyingly the friend I play is just interested in burning time, so as long as we are using up time playing he isn't bothered about progression or getting better.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Of course separately. I'm not a monster!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You know those straight to Netflix (etc) type of Christmas movies? Those. Not a set list, there's plenty new ones each year. But there's definite classics happening closer to the date\\
I'm not a massive Christmas person ( as in the immediate days around it) but I love a cheesy movie and a market\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And birthday is on the other side of the festivities so still have a couple of months\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I mean, I should have definitely worked, and I'll pay for it during the week but I guess just needed some down time\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh booo to the crashing games. Are you actually playing in the same place or online?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Some people do make questionable cocktails. They must make a non alcoholic version of Bailey's though or i'd think it couldn't be too hard to replicate.\\
I know the ones, I have no doubt seen more of them than I would like to admit. They are certainly easy to watch.\\That's sort of the problem with work. There is always more than can be done. Very few people (if any) have a job where they can be genuinely finished with nothing to do. I find it make us think we should always be doing more or feel guilty for trying to relax. Which is madness really. As long as you've done enough.\\Pretty standard for the first week of a new game. They all get rushed now. Just play online, I am long past carting machines around from place to place. Although my friend who I play with lives up the road.\\So are you doing a whole movie marathon or will you finish at one?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh god yes they do.\\
I haven't come across it yet, and I've gotten quite good at finding the non-alcoholic versions of things\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh honestly, if I wanted to work 24\/7 I'd always have something to do.\\
I'm interested to find it about all the bits and pieces you do\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll probably do one or two tonight. I've got 6 weeks to go. Gotta pace myself\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What are you up to tonight?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Companies have got really good at doing non-alcoholic stuff now. I have tried some terrible beer and gin but it has all got better. You can just about tell its not the same but its it pretty good. I was out for dinner with a few friends the other week and we all ended up drinking non-alcoholic beer.\\
A joke I have with a few people but mainly my trainer is around how I used to find the time to do what I do when I was working and my response is that's why I had to quit. Work was getting in the way of everything else. It just never ends and, for me, very few people cared if it was being done. Good to know your interested.\\Probably good for the mind to pace the movies but you cannot be at risk of running out?\\Tonight is probably similar to you. I started watching "Long Shot" at lunch so will finish that off. Maybe another film but more likely some You Tube rabbit hole. I've got some very exciting house work to do and before I know it it will be the end of the day. Up early so will think about an early night and then mess it up somehow.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm not a big fan of the nonalc beer but the gins are definitely nice. Prosecco is horrid.\\
Haha, yeah. Work definitely gets in the way of things. But alas, I have to do it for them bills\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Definitely good for the mind to pace myself. Don't want to end up in some Christmas movie rabbit hole not even half way through November\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh what's the long shot?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What are you up to tomorrow that has you up early?\\
Definitely an early one for me as per\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Long shot is a rom com as well with Charlize Theron and Seth Rogen. Funnier than I remember, which is nice.\\
Tomorrow I’m normally up early for my spin class but tomorrow I have the fun of some kidney scan thing because I went to the doctor for one thing and they maybe found something else. They might use some cool tech but I’m slightly annoyed I have to miss my spin class for it. Better to be checked though.\\I’m guessing you try and get to school for 7:30?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh now you say, I think I've heard of it.\\
Oh no! Everything alright? Are you breaking apart?\\Definitely better to get checked out. I'm sure you can catch up on your spin class\\I leave here about 6.30 so there for about 7ish\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well I certainly hope I’m not breaking apart. I feel ok, So I’m hoping it is all a positive waste of time. Will find out soon enough.\\
It won’t kill me to miss a class, might be able to do an extra one later the week but I’ve got a PT session in the evening anyway.\\Ouch, that’s earlier than I guessed. I’ll try not to keep you out too late on Thursday then.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh nice. Which PT are you seeing?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah, it's stupid early. That's why I'm already in bed, like the good 80- year old I am :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yea please, do try\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hannah is my PT. We moved over to Titans from gym fit 4 less. It’s the whole reason I ended up at Titans. She’s been my trainer for 3 years now.\\
It’s is just simple time maths. If your up at 5 something. Need to be asleep by 10.\\Will try.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't think I know her\\
\section*{Monday $13\textsuperscript{th}$}
I usually aim for 9.30 as up at 5. But Sunday is always the worst.\\Speaking of.. I'm going to try to sleep now.\\Night. Sleep well\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll quiz her later to see if she knows you. You cannot miss her now as she is the pregnant one. Steph is the PT that most people seem to know.\\
Hope you have a good day.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning!\\
Ah she probably doesn't tbh.\\Yeah I'm seeing Steph too\\Have a good day and hope it goes well at the doctor's\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Morning :grinning-face:\\
Thanks.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What is this weather?!? Feel like I've just aquaplaned down the M40\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s “people drive like muppets” weather and a good excuse to stay inside. The thoughts of maybe going for run have gone.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly :face-with-rolling-eyes:\\
Wish I could stay inside\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: They say if you can dream it you can make it happen.\\
Table is booked for Thursday.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: If that were true I'd be a lady of leisure :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh thank you. Loving this efficiency\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's the day been?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well you could be. Just have to face to consequences of doing. That’s the only down side.\\
I do try and be efficient. Sometimes a good thing and sometimes not.\\I’ve spent the day learning calculus, so now I’m off to the gym for a rest as my head hurts  :grinning-face: then I’ve got a uni tutorial once I get back.\\How was yours?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think you need funds to be lady of leisure :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
When is it not a good thing?\\Today was mental. Stopped for a food shop on the way back. Will head to the gym later too, just waiting for a call from the mortgage guy. Dreading it.\\Why were you doing calculus? Astronomy bits?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is the trick. Funding.\\
I think sometimes trying to be efficient can use up a lot of time or energy but overall it’s a good thing.\\Good luck. Hopefully it’s not terrible but it’s one of these annoying things you have zero control over. Just have to find the best option there is with the information you have.\\Yeah, there is a lot more theory maths than I was expecting. It’s more for the quantum mechanics and cosmology.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you enjoying the course? What's the plan when you finish it?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Overall yes, it is all super interesting and I'm finally learning about things I've always been interested on. I'm currently on 3 separate modules and they do range on a scale of "Very interesting and fun" to "This makes no sense" Hopefully it will all start to make sense soon enough.\\
I'll answer the second question on Thursday if that's ok as I'd like to think the whole plan is an interesting story.\\Good to see you earlier. Very impressed with your self motivation and going in the evening. I much prefer doing it in the morning.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Absolutely, look forward to hearing about it on Thursday.\\
Yeah! Nice to see you too.\\I've got to motivate myself. I prefer mornings too but the only one I have is Sunday and that probably wouldn't be too good for consistency :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\Oh and I hit 60kg in the last set after you left. Zain had to spot me but I did it!\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done on hitting 60kg. Have you got a target your aiming for?\\
I suspect I’ll be made to do squats on Friday.\\Zain is always keen to help the women out :grinning-face: but it is good that people help each other there.\\Sundays used to be my biggest workout day. Spin and then the gym. Worked great as long as I didn’t have plans for the rest of the day and kept me from going mad Saturday night. Hoping to get it back when they open downstairs\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I used to joke with my old PT that I wanted to squat, deadlift, and hipthrust a grown ass man :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Haha, yeah he is. But I know him from gym4less so less intimidating than a rando\\How was tutorial?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s seems very achievable.\\
I think my friend only weighs 65kg. Which is less than Hannah and Steph. I’m not sure how. He is strong but just doesn’t eat.\\As part of getting fit and lifting weights I’ve been very suprised at just how strong women are or reallly how strong they are and how they keep it a secret. You just cannot tell if they are “normal” or if they could break you half. For men it’s much more obvious.\\My next target is to try for the 1000 pound club. Across deadlift, squat and bench.\\How did we not see each other at gymfit4less. I was gutted when it closed.\\Erm, it started well. Went very fast and then the last bit only sort of made sense. It’s the raw maths that is getting me. Expanding universe is fine but rearranging equations hurt\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I did say a grown ass man :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Oh women are amazing!\\To be honest, I'm strong in the bottom half but chicken arms up top. I want to be able to do a proper, considerable clean and press.\\Those are a lot of pounds!!\\We didn't see each other because you go during the work day and I go like the normal folk :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\I actually prefer titans I think\\Oh god, I can't help you with any of that. Math just doesn't go with my brain\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, so what weight are you aiming for then 90-100kg?\\
They are. I think I’m only about a 100 pounds short at the moment. A curse of seeing things on the internet and thinking “I can do that”\\I see a few joke videos around that. A man following a women onto various gym machine being completely unable to do any of the leg stuff and then nearly flying off when getting to the arms. On the plus side arms are easier to train.\\Your probably right. Although I did used to go in the morning and some evening classes, these jobs things really get in the way, but I was able to do the 9:30 classes as well. Although that was still true when I had a job.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah, probably something like that. Already have that with hip thrusts\\
Ah that's really good! Soon enough you'll hit that.\\Yeah we seem to have it all in the legs :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\Oh they really do. Got to get myself one of those working from home jobs.\\Are you going to the ypom Christmas pizza thing?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Working at home jobs do have an advantage.\\
I hadn’t signed up for the pizza thing but was thinking about. 8th I think? It’s the same weekend as my birthday so worked out what I was doing.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ooh December birthday! What day? Hold old are you turning?\\
What did you work out you'll be doing?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 20 questions :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, actual birthday is 7th, 41 and doing a house party on the 9th.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hah, so you're doing a birthday week then?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not sure about that. I have an assignment due that week. Doing something with my brother in the day. I’ve Never been very good at celebrating my birthday.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aah know the feeling.\\
Are you born and bred round here?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Another question probably best saved as there is some detail but the short version is yes.\\
In the nicest possible way. Aren’t you normally asleep by now?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well you should now make a list of all the questions I asked and you answered with "Thursday" :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: In the nicest possible way??\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, yeah I'm in bed now. Had a later dinner than usual so had to digest :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I just didn’t want the sleep question to come across like I didn’t want to chat.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sure sure :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Although my phone just told me it was bes time\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Bed\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It absolutely is!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't forget the list\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night, I already started a list.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good!\\
\section*{Tuesday $14\textsuperscript{th}$}
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Morning. Hope you have a good day.\\
I’m just off to my spin class with the weird instructor. Here’s hoping there is more people than last time.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning!\\
Haha, is that at buzz?\\Hope you're not the only one there. Have a good day :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah at buzz. Was an ok class in the end and 6 of us. Which is better than normal. You need a lot of people really so you can all hate it together.\\
I’m really hoping the new Titans but works out well so that I can then stop buzz.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah 6 is good. I've only ever done one spin class and I think it made me sick.\\
I had to quit buzz. There was no buzz just constant overstimulation and insta models.\\Did he say he was opening it in Dec?\\What are you up to today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: If you don’t feel a bit odd, sick and ruined after your first spin class then you have done it wrong. I nearly fell of bike on my first one and then everything hurt so bad I had to miss the next 2 classes. Maybe I can persuade you try again with a titans ones. Hannah is a brilliant spin instructor. Everyone else’s classes are too easy.\\
I see what you did there. I would say it’s loud but titans is loud. Buzz is full of students. Seems to be built more for cardio than proper weights, even though they have all the gear.\\Should all be opened up in December as apparently then when he needs everyone out of storage. Just in time for the January influx.\\Got a bit of what I call busy work today. We have been given some telescope time and our assignment is to record and then analyse an exoplanet transit. So I’ve got to go through the list of candidates I made and rank them to see what one(s) I can try and capture on the night we have. Then have a meeting about it which will be painful. End result should be very cool though.\\I assume your yelling at children all day? Anything fun planned?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Maybe you could persuade me when all the new bits are up and running.\\
Everyone out of storage?\\That does sound like a busy but interesting day!\\I do not tell at children all day :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\Zero fun things planned but I've got Steph's class tonight\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I'll remember that about spin. It is defiantly something that needs a few goes as the first couple of time are rubbish.\\
Everyone should have been everything. My understanding is he has a load of equipment somewhere ready to move in.\\Auto correct failure. Yelling clearly should have been teaching :grinning-face:\\Steph's class should be fun. ish. As long as it isn't a grit session. Some of her videos of those session make it look super hard. I used to do her step class and its a bit of a shame there isn't a replacement.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah yeah, I heard he bought out equipment of a gym that closed.\\
Yeah it should be good. It's bars not grit. I don't think I've done her grit class yet. But I'm so tired :sleeping-face::sleeping-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: If it’s the spin bikes from gymfit I’m really hoping they get repaired. The bikes are better than the buzz ones but I may have broken a few of them.\\
Bars is ok although it still looks horrible. The grit stuff just looks madness. It’s looks like very intense cardio \/ body weight with no rest!\\The class could be a good kill or cure for tiredness. Any chance of a nap or not such an early start tomorrow?\\Also I’ve added a few more questions to the list…\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No, it's not gymfit, another gym, hammer strength one I think. Steph was telling me but my brain retains very little :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
It is tough! And I don't think I'll have a chance for a nap and definitely no later starts. Pretty set in stone this teaching malarkey.\\Ooooh, for me? Or you to answer?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh that will be interesting to see what the new stuff is like. I think the main section is getting the new stuff and the women’s only bit is keeping what is there already.\\
If it’s just retaining the number of sets to do then I think that is everyone. Even PTs cannot remember or count.\\I guess if Sunday morning is your only proper lie in then your almost setup to fail \/ be tired. As it’s difficult to get to sleep early Sunday night when your up late. So then you need the Sunday morning lie in to catch up and the cycle repeats until holiday. I’m fine (ish) getting up at 6am everyday but not much earlier. Not to brag but I do get a lie in tomorrow.\\Erm, yes :face-with-tears-of-joy: mainly stuff for you but I have added stuff for me to answer as well.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The main section will still be for everyone, no?\\
I mean, you're talking like I'm painting the town red every weekend :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy: I'm an old lady. And tbh the cat wakes me up early anyway. I much prefer a nap to a lay in.\\Do you not get a lay in most days?? :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\Oh.. should I be worried?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I was told that the new downstairs area is going to be the main section for everyone and upstairs will be women's only. That's what Hannah had said anyway.\\
You mean your NOT at trilogy every Friday and Saturday night :face-with-tears-of-joy: Pets will do that. As long as they don't do it in a way that scares you awake. Just the 1 cat?\\The cheek! I'm up earlier now than when I had a job, all my own fault. Wednesday and Sunday I get a lie in and i'll lose Wednesday from next week (I think) as I go back to the gym early morning.\\Defiantly shouldn't be worried. Hopefully intrigued. I just think there is a lot of stuff that is more fun to talk about in person.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Uuf finally home.\\
So it's probably going to be the same set up as gymfit I guess.\\I am in Trilogy every Friday, Saturday AND Sunday night! If by trilogy you mean sofa, blanket and cat...\\Yup just the one fury overlord singing the song of his people at 4am\\Well definitely your own fault. You could be having lie ins every day!\\Okay... I'll take your word for it :eyes:\\How was the day?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ouch, 11 hours door to door? Is that everyday?\\
Yeah I think something like that.   Not sure if they have thought through parking.\\Fury overlord :face-with-tears-of-joy: why is it always 4am. It’s not even light then. Not what you need that early. Then they give you a dirty look when you wake them up in the day time.\\I could but that does get boring quite quickly. If you can believe it. I do have to remind myself it’s all my fault and that I waited years to do this.\\Day was pretty good. Got the work done. Had a call with the other students on my group project :man-facepalming:. Damn group projects. Was like going back to work where no one talks. Felt a bit like pulling teeth but all done now. Got another tutorial in an hour, which is probably going to hurt. We will see.\\Hope you enjoy the class.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I try not to make it every day. But sometimes it's more. You can start seeing the glimpses of the workload now.\\
Oh yeah he just wants me awake so he feels like we're going for a nap after. He loves napping with me. And I love napping. It all works out\\Yeah it does.\\I can't wait to hear the whole story!\\Ah brilliant. Very productive of you. I'm struggling to motivate myself to get changed and go to class :sleeping-face:\\How often do you have tutorials?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, I’m aware of the workload. I‘ll leave that cryptic bit there :grinning-face:\\
Sounds about right for a cat. Wants you to be awake so you can sleep on his terms.\\If it helps I think the times you want to work out the least are when it counts the most. That’s also why I like classes. They have a time, people get used to seeing you there. So helps make me go. It will be fun once you get there or at least that’s the positive adjective a PT would use.\\At the moment quite a lot. 2 or 3 a week and they are all evening. Only for an hour normally. Last year some where at lunch which was much better. Brain was much less fried.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh don't tell me you used to do this :eyes::eyes::eyes:\\
Oh he's a bit special on top of the usual cat shenanigans.\\It was such a tough class. I'll be in a lot of pain tomorrow. I know I need to eat but really don't fancy anything\\Oh that's a full on schedule with the tutorials. None on Thursday?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I gotta keep some secrets :grinning-face:\\
I'm not sure I have even met a normal cat. They all seem different \/ special in their own way.\\A good pain hopefully. I had that yesterday, best to force it though or I'd just end up eating crap or feel even worse the next day. Busy class?\\They seem to avoid Thursday's, Friday's and Sunday's and keep them at the start of the week. Due to the way it all works you do get a few conflicts, which is a real pain. So next week I have 2 at the same time. Hopefully the one I have to skip will be recorded.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: As long as they are not skeletons :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
They are mental.\\Unfortunately not a good pain. I've got a *condition so I will pay for two days in the gym in a row.\\Ah that's good. At least you get them out of the way I guess.\\Well two at the same time is not a really good schedule on their part :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\Hopefully it works out\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: nah, no skeletons. Some damage but no skeletons. All to be revealed (in a good way).\\
I like the idea of a dog first then a cat so that the cat is more dog like. Theory being it will take some of the mentalness out of the cat. also if you have a dog that acts like a cat then that would be real bad. Its a shame you just can't get a dog sized cat.\\Oh, that's not fun. I already have a couple of questions for Thursday lined up around that.\\They can never know who is doing what so it would be impossible for them to plan it all and avoid conflict. It all works itself out in the end. There isn't another option really.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah we all have damage. Especially us middle aged folk\/ elder millennials :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
I'd love to get Spud a sibling but my flat is too small. And obviously with my job it would be terrible getting a dog.\\Haha, I bet you do! Are you bringing a paper list to check off?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Middle aged? I was saving it but how old are you? Low 30’s I think. You don’t get this far through without damage. As long as it’s identified then it’s ok.\\
That’s a great name. Don’t fall for the thought that getting him a friend is a good idea.\\Dogs do need a lot of time. I wanted to get a hearing dog puppy but don’t have the time.\\Paper!! It’s all on the phone. :grinning-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm only 4 years younger than you :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Oh I'm definitely getting him a kitten once I'm in a bigger place :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: even though I think he might have an only child syndrome at this point\\Haha, you really have a list don't you?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I thought you were a lot younger than that.\\
I’m not sure my dog forgave me for getting him a friend but that’s a whole story as well.\\Oh yeah I have a list. So I don’t forget things.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Shall I be taking that as a compliment?\\
There will be so many stories and questions at this rate. Don't forget I have an early bedtime :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Absolutely a compliment.\\
Well we don’t have to get through them all in the first evening.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Is it because the few times you've seen me I've behaved like an absolute nutter?? :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Oh yea, if everything goes well you'll have time to ask me all the questions from the ever-growing list!\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I'm trying to think of what occasions you think that is as I dont remember ever thinking you were behaving like a nutter. I just would have guessed you were about 32.\\
\section*{Wednesday $15\textsuperscript{th}$}
Well, I'm hoping it does.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, good to know!\\
Also, Morning! Hope you're enjoying your lie in!\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Morning. Enjoying might be a stretch. Some people wake up fully refreshed and ready to attack the day. This is not me, regardless of the amount of sleep. Hoping it will help with studying today.\\
Just trying to psych myself up to go for a run.\\Hope you have a good day. Try not to work too hard.\\How are you feeling? (Gym pain)\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm never not tired :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: but that's part and parcel of the *condition so :woman-shrugging-light-skin-tone:\\
What's the plan for today? Just studying?\\Oof a run! Good luck! Where did you go?\\I'm not great tbh and have to be at work until 6pm today. Honestly don't know how I'm surviving today\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Are you sure the being tired thing just isn’t part of the adult benefits package we all get once we turn 18 :grinning-face: although that is much worse if medical stuff adds to it.\\
Super exciting plan for today. Learn some more maths that doesn’t currently make sense, blend that with some chores that need doing and tonight I have a 90 minute tutorial on quantum mechanics. Which I am really hoping starts to make sense.\\Still not gone yet! I’ve got a 2.5 km route from my house where I can around and then through some of Hughenden. I keep thinking I’ll make it 3km and then chicken out.\\I’m sorry to hear that. Surviving  the day is non optional I’m afraid. Otherwise is really messed plans I have for tomorrow.\\Why have you got to stay so late? Parents evening or teacher training.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, I wish it was just the general adult tiredness. I could cope with that :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Maths and quantum mechanics. My brain would not compute that. Good luck!\\Have you gone yet? You can do it!!\\Oh bloody hell, I guess I'll get through today then. Only as not to bugger your plans :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\It's a cpd twilight. Absolutely pointless but here we are\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: If you wanted to learn it you could learn it. I’m not sure I’d recommend it but if you wanted to you could. Just remember that when I sound all smart tomorrow I still don’t understand it :grinning-face:\\
Got the run done. Hughenden is just a swamp but a good excuse to walk \/ slide for a bit. Think my next challenge month is going to be to make sure I do cardio everyday (not Sunday) and see what that does.\\Well I appreciate you suffering to keep my calendar from changing :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\Ahh yes “cpd twilight” so clear and obvious :grinning-face: child protection something is my guess.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't really want to learn iti think I've got enough in my brain :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Ah well done on the run. That's a good challenge. I definitely lost most of my cardio fitness since I had to stop running\\I'm expecting a medal for my bravery. Thank you\\Cpd stands for continuous professional development. Even clearer, no?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Running seems to be very annoying in that if you don’t do it for a week or longer your body just seems to reset like you’ve never done it before in your life. Which really seems unfair.\\
Oh that CPD. That is worse. What rubbish. Yearly goals etc.\\you cannot really be honest when you get asked. What work would like to do in a years time?. “None would be the aim. By next year I’d love it if I was doing no work” then they trick you into thinking that doing more work is what you want or trick you into managing people.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's very unfair.\\
Hah, not performance management. Cpd= teacher training basically.\\And next year I'm hoping not be doing this :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’d really like to get the version 2 of the human body where it makes more sense. Things that are good for you taste good and don’t hurt and bad thing hurt. Rather than the stupid way round it is now.\\
Intriguing. As in you won’t be a teacher next year?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I would just like to get the version where my body works. Really selling myself, aren't I?\\
Uuf, that's a big conversation, partly to do with *condition. To be completely honest I don't know what's going to happen.\\How's your day going?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You’d be surprised how well your doing at selling yourself.\\
Everyone’s got something.\\Added to the list :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\Sometimes not knowing can be a good thing. Sometimes.\\I have found it can make you work out what is and isn’t important.\\Chores took a lot longer than I wanted and still got some left. I need that lottery win so I can get a housekeeper.\\I have had a minor breakthrough with imaginary numbers and how their complex conjugates can be helpful. The first part being that I understand that sentence.\\There is a lot of shorthand that gets used that your assumed to know and I don’t. The hard part is finding out what it is.\\I guess you’ve got 2 hours of training now?\\Anything else planned for the evening?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh tell me more about how well I'm doing :beaming-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
Yeah. There are some hard decisions in my future I feel.\\Oh I'd 100\% get a cleaner if I could.\\Good job on imaginary numbers!\\Yup, 2 hours of training :sleeping-face:\\The only plan I have is get home, dinner, shower bed...\\What are you up to tonight?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: This is where I get myself in trouble.\\
Your interesting, there is a depth of character that I’m really keen to learn more about. You’ve obviously been through and are still going through something but every time I’ve seen you your always cheerful and kind. No bitterness. You take care of yourself. Proving a strong personality but it seems that you can laugh at yourself and generally have fun. Plus, your really pretty.\\Cleaner and personal chief would be bought straight away if I could.\\Tonight is just dreading this tutorial because I need it to make sense and then probably bed as well. See I’m cool as well :grinning-face:\\Enjoy training as best you can.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Why would you get yourself in trouble??\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just an assumption I generally have where I’ll say the wrong thing.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also, what a smooth talker you are!\\
(I got rudely interrupted half way through writing)\\Oh you've got fun times happening too.\\I can't do another hour, feels like my brain is going to come it of my ears\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thanks, not that any of my friends would believe you if you told them.\\
I've said before. Work really does get in the way :grinning-face:\\Loads of fun. Would be better if these tutorials were during the day. I might be a dribbling mess by the end.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What do your friends think of you? :eyes::eyes:\\
Doesn't it just\\Oh I bet it would. It's hard to get the brain going when it's dark.\\I literally just parked up at home. Too tired to get out\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is a great question.\\
I have no idea. Hopefully some nice things. You’ll have to ask them and then let me know.\\It does remind me of a quote I like “other people’s opinion of me is none of my business”\\I get like that sometimes. At least the work is done for the day. All you’ve got to do is eat and relax. Bath maybe?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully you're friends have nice things to say about you :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Yeah, bath might be a good idea. Will see if I can manage.\\What time is your tutorial?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think some of them might say nice things.\\
Tutorial starts now. Just found out we have breakout rooms and I'm going to have to contribute :face-screaming-in-fear:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ooooh nooo. Not breakout rooms, not a big fan.\\
Hope it goes well. Just waiting for my dinner\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: What drives me slightly insane is that it’s 2023 and a ridiculously high number of people cannot use conferencing software.\\
I assume that means you cheated and ordered takeaway. Good plan.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh it's unbelievable\\
I am an extended tech support in my department.\\Haha, no. Fish pie in the oven\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well, that hurt slightly more than going to the dentist. 50\% due to people not being able to use technology. Its always fun hearing people talking to other people in their house because they don't use a headset. Then there were the question. I'll leave this one hear.\\
"An F-centre can be modelled as an electron trapped in a cubic three-dimensional infinite square well. Calculate the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation emitted when an electron makes a transition from the third energy level to the lowest energy level in such a well. "\\Hope you've managed to relax a bit. I think i'm going for a lie down :grinning-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think my brain malfunctioned...\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I did. The bath helped and now getting ready for bed\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've reread it and still have no clue\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That was the last question which reads like complete gibberish. Some super chirpy person in my group knew exactly what it meant, nerd. Which actually turned out to be a fairly simple equation. So its was a bit of a trick. :man-facepalming:\\
Glad the bath helped.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you done now for the day\/evening?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh yes. Completely done.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha nice! Doing anything?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not really. Bit of TV then try for an early night. Spin in the morning.\\
Isn’t it end of the day for you?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh what do you like to watch?\\
It is! Just got tucked in\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Normally it’s a lot of eclectic You Tube. Gaming, science, sailing, nerd things.\\
Disney + just released a documentary series on the Brawn F1 season. So have started that. It’s the only sport I watch.\\Night.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night!\\
\section*{Thursday $16\textsuperscript{th}$}
See you tomorrow\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Morning. Hope you have a good day today and I’m really looking forward to this evening.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning!!\\
Hope you have a good day too. What's your plan?\\Me too :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh I’ve got a full rock and roll day planned out :grinning-face:\\
Got a quantum mechanics chapter to work through and got to see if I can make sense of last nights work. I’d like to think it’s only a couple of hours work but I know it isn’t. Plus some admin stuff on our group project.\\Then get ready, overthink, feel nervous and see you.\\Your plan?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah.\\
Get ready, overthink, feel nervous??\\Well, super unexpectedly and out of the ordinary, I've got to teach. Full day and a meeting. Woop\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is unexpected :grinning-face: although I do know you’d normal have at least one free period a day. Not sure what is worse teaching a class or a meeting?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I definitely do not have at least one free period a day :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I guess it would be mean to suggest that lunch would count :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: My 25mins lunch definitely doesn't count :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: 25 minutes! WTF are you meant to do in that?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Exactly!! I drink my lunch in form time :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Drink it? Protein shake?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah huel\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Can't really manage anything else\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ve done that. It certainly take the fun out of lunch. I am not a fan of the coffee flavour.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I currently have vanilla or strawberry. Absolutely no fun\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm looking forward to dinner :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, I need to do it again really. At least dinner should be good \/ worth the wait.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm definitely hoping it's worth the wait :winking-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :winking-face: I’ll try not to disappoint\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I mean, ditto\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am so hungry :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Crackers straight away it is :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Omg absolutely\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I parked in the Sainsbury's car park\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm hooooome\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s good. Just back myself.\\
I really enjoyed tonight. Looking forward to the next one, once we work it out :grinning-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I had a really good time too. Thank you for feeding me and the company.\\
Yes definitely! (I did warn you about my crazy schedule :face-with-tears-of-joy:)\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well my schedule isn’t much better. Certainly the next week is a bit mental. Always the way.\\
We’ll work something out. Thursday day time could be something.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We will!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also, sorry for world's most awkward double cheek peck :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, I thought I made it awkward. We can sort it next time.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You keep catching me by surprise :woman-shrugging-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: In a good way?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, yes\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok, that’s good.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thanks again for a lovely evening\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thanks for saying “maybe” :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Even though you didn't keep to your promise and I have turned into a pumpkin\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahahah\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I blame the restaurant\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sure sure\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Right, bedtime for this pumpkin\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night. Sleep well\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night. Sleep well.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Jinx\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha\\
\section*{Friday $17\textsuperscript{th}$}
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Morning. In what way am I surprising you?\\
Hope the day goes well.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning :sleeping-face::sleeping-face::sleeping-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have you been thinking about that since yesterday?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well not necessarily surprising me, just catching me by surprise. For one, I wasn't expecting to be asked out..\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Erm, maybe :thinking-face:\\
After the initial thought that it was something bad it made me wonder.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That creates more questions than asked. Why wouldn’t you expect me or someone to ask you out?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Why would you think it was bad?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't know. There weren't signs :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Please don't overthink this. I am rubbish with any cues or signals. I had a brill time last night! :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: A thing I do that is bad that I'm really working on getting better at is the assumption of the worst. A lot of scenario planning. Worked great for my career but is a real pain for social stuff\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is a little bit like asking water not to be wet :grinning-face: good to know we are both rubbish with cues and signals. That should actually make things easier\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well as long as communication is open and honest. Because I also don't want to be second guessing and worrying about things. No cryptic stuff please. Just cards on the table :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I really like that and that how I like things to be as well.\\
I'm not always the best at explaining things but as long as you can get it out there and then work through it.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just make sure you say things :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What's the plan for today?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Cards on the table. I like you.\\
Moving on.\\Busy morning. PT session with new squat PB 2x5@120kg so that was good. Will mean pain tomorrow.\\Friend came over for a coffee and then I just got off the phone to an old work colleague who I speak to most weeks.\\Gotta work through the rest of this chapter I don’t understand this afternoon and try and work out what I need to learn in order to understand that maths that currently makes no sense. I’m at the point where I’d really like to know if I need this module or not.\\As for this evening I know you said you were cleaning and preparing for your friend but any time or room to meet? I was going to offer to help but I’m rubbish at cleaning so it would be more of a project manger role of me getting in the way \/ watching.\\I could bring food for when you’ve finished? I was thinking of getting a kebab later. There are other options I’m sure.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good! Would be quite awkward otherwise :winking-face:\\
Get that learning going! Hope it goes well.\\I do have a LOT of stuff to do tonight as I haven't really had an evening at home this week. But I could maybe spare a half an hour on my way back from work for a coffee?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Half an hour I’ll take.\\
Where? My place (to bold), somewhere in Eden, other.\\What time? Did you say you had detention today or maybe that was next week.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I should be leaving here in about 20 mins.\\
You're in hughenden? I could stop at the spindle or yours?\\Heads up I look like death warmed over, and have big fluffy odd socks on because school\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Meet at mine then if that's ok with you. I'm 2 mins from the spindle.\\
19 Wyndham Avenue\\HP13 5ER\\White car on the drive and you can park on the drive\\Well, if you dont judge the house to much I wont judge the socks\\I guess i'll see you just around 4\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. Maps says about 35 mins\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: great, see you in a bit\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Leaving now\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Here I think\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Really nice seeing you again. Obviously.\\
Hope you get everything done that you need.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: <attached: 00000255-AUDIO-2023-11-17-17-20-25.opus>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think you have over thought what I might be over thinking about.\\
What do you think I over thought?\\My only thoughts when you left was “That was really nice and holy crap she is hot. When am I going to see her again.”\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha. No no, I meant that I was overthinking. I didn't want to come across mean\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh, your fine. I took at you teasing\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good good\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And yes, it was lovely seeing you again. Sorry I had to run off\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And aww... Careful, I might get a big head :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: As much as I would have liked you to stay you were very clear you had things to do. So I can respect that. Much better than not seeing you at all.\\
A teacher without a big head already! That’s new :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes but now it's much harder focusing on all the crap I've got to do!\\
Oh excuuuuse mee... I am perfectly humble I'll have you know :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\Good luck with finishing the chapter\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well, get the crap done fast and come back….\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll probably be comatose by the end. Need to get out of the car!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Comatose by the end is ok. Just not during.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-rolling-eyes::face-with-rolling-eyes::face-with-rolling-eyes::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Gotta make the jokes when they come up :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, indeed\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Right. Stuff to sort\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good luck.\\
Still happy to help \/ get in the way. Hopefully it doesn’t take long once you get started.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, might be bit of an early days for watching me clean my flat :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, good point. I’ll wait for it to be clean.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh you're getting invited? Play your cards right and you might\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00000277-GIF-2023-11-17-18-09-24.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I meant to ask you yesterday.. you know you asked me whether I was ticking off my checklist... Were you?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Checklist. What checklist :grinning-face:\\
Joking aside. You mean a list of qualities in a partner?\\Is this procrastination to stop you doing other jobs?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm just eating dinner :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
You asked about a checklist!\\Don't skirt the question :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Like you, I may have deal breakers along with qualities I’m looking for. So far your doing really well. If that was your worry.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What are your deal breakers?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok, really getting into it. Should have talked about this on the sofa.\\
Deal breakers\\Vegan or vegetarian\\Definitely wants children\\Doesn’t like me\\Mean\\Doesn’t take care of them self\\Asexual\\Then, based on dating, there is a surprisingly basic list of what I thought all adults could do. So this is the needs list\\Live on their own\\Drive\\Have a job or have access to their own money\\Not be married\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not be married :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We probably should but it just popped into my head now. Sorry!\\
Is the 'mean' going against me?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You joke but you’d be surprised.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You were mean in a teasing funny way. I’m talking about people who are just bitter and mean to everyone about everything\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I'm definitely not going to be surprised! Remember I've been dating for the past 4.5 years . Or trying to :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: To be clear. I really like having good deep conversations. I even have a card game for it that can be really fun.\\
I’m a bit wary of doing them over txt as there is so much room for misinterpretation. Which if it was being done in person would immediately be corrected.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: By “trying to” do you mean by hoping they would just knock on the front door or that you would crash i to their car like in a rom com :grinning-face:\\
Save that answer for in person .\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh definitely, I get what you mean. I do worry that my tone sometimes doesn't come through on text.\\
I'd be up for the game :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okay..\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Cards on the table. I like you too\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And that is the fundamental problem with txt. The more you know someone the better it is. I think I’m getting a lot of your tone correct.\\
Sarcasm is the hardest if not impossible to get across.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Erm, this is the best txt I’ve had in a very long time.\\
Slightly awkward as it make me very uncomfortable but in a great way.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh why does it make you uncomfortable?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: An insecurity of mine, that I find it hard to believe that people like me.\\
Something I’ve been working on for years.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: <attached: 00000299-GIF-2023-11-17-18-51-38.mp4>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I get what you mean. I'm finding it equally cute and terrifying\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Maybe that’s a good thing we both find it the same.\\
I was going for more rugged than cute but I’ll take it.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha. Just take the compliment\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Your right. Thank you.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just one more deep thing. If we are going to see how this goes I'd love to do it properly. Dates and cute stuff :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Does that sound ok?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well yeah. I’d like to know what you mean by cute stuff but I certainly didn’t expect that we just jump straight to only watching TV on the sofa while doom scrolling on our phones.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Like just activities. I don't know. I dug myself a hole here :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Keep digging…\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Today was an example of me being pragmatic. I’d rather the 30mins on the sofa having a chat than nothing but equally I want us to do things (not like that) and that doesn’t only mean dinner somewhere.\\
Input on what those things are would also be good. Slightly difficult to have a quick date at Chester zoo.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh absolutely. I wouldn't expect you to do all the work :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
Chester can go on a list\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just need to find out what makes you tick\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That part of the fun \/ fear stage. Working each other out.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Indeed it is!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Different question. We’re you wearing contact’s yesterday night?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No! Just took my glasses off in the car :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh, that’s why I looked so good yesterday then.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm not that blind. Primarily need them for driving. I'm good with up close\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good to know. I just need for screens.\\
How are the jobs going?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: There's too many. Just attacking bathroom and need to hoover real quick so I don't piss of the neighbours\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's the chapter?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m done with the chapter for now. Will look at the end of again over the weekend to see if it makes any more sense.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good! What are you up to tonight?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well I was secretly hoping this girl I like would finish her chores so that she might invite me round for another kiss but it looks like I’m going to be playing video games instead.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Patience young padawan. Can't be having too much of a good thing right away :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
I still haven't hoovered :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone::woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone::woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh I have patience. I’ve been waiting long enough.\\
Some good things aren’t bad for you though…\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Too much of a good thing :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
All finished and getting ready for bed.\\How are videogames?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Bedtime for me. Hope you had a good evening.\\
Night. Sleep well x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Game are a bit slow but never mind.\\
\section*{Saturday $18\textsuperscript{th}$}
Well done for getting it all done.\\Night.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning!\\
Park running today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Morning. Yep, id assumed you weren’t? When does your friend arrive\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hoping to be faster again this week\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup, unfortunately not this week. She's getting here about 10, picking her up from the coach way.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good luck. Hope the rain stops for you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I had not looked outside yet :grimacing-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yeah, it's not pretty :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Bugger. Probably better to run in it than volunteer like I did a few weeks ago.\\
Why didn’t or hasn’t your friend driven?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Definitely running through it is better!\\
Well she's coming from Dublin so might have taken a little while\\She's just taking the bus from Heathrow ( glad I don't have to go there)\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh that does make sense. Heathrow pickup isn’t terrible. It’s the only airport I’d take or pick someone up from.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: To be honest I've never picked anyone up from there so not sure. But the bus is super easy and speedy anyway\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So, after your super helpful suggestions on “cute things” (that is a joke as you listed nothing :grinning-face:)\\
I have a cryptic question. What are your thoughts on ballroom dancing?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That is a cute thing... And omg yes\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: “Bus is speedy” nah, I’m not sure that right :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What are you saying yes to? I didn’t ask a yes or no question.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: My thoughts on ballroom dancing are yes\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: This is why men get confused by women :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Ok, so ballroom dance lessons are a yes!\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Soz, I thought my excitement was clear :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was, just playing\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Also found \/ remembered quite a few other “cute things” (still no thoughts from yourself :squinting-face-with-tongue:)\\
One slight problem is that pretty much all of them need day time and\/or it to be dry outside. Still working on some ideas of what can be done inside.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well, lemme do some input. A Christmas market, museum, national trust, a hike, pottery class, zoo, cooking, board games, frontroom events are always nice. I'm sure I'll think of something else.\\
I definitely want to play that card game you mentioned at some point too.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I appreciate you thinking about this\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m realising a mistake. I should have listed all my idea because now it will look like I’m taking from your list :grinning-face:\\
What is a bit odd for me when researching it and looking at at least half the stuff you just said my brain goes “but this is what couples do anyway”.\\I hope that comes across right (positively)\\Oh, we’ll play the card game and I’d like to play more games as there seem a lot of cool ones out there. Better than watching rubbish TV.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Also, what are frontroom events? Google is telling me it’s a coffee shop.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh you can still list your ideas :beaming-face-with-smiling-eyes: you know, just in case I am fundamentally against something :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
You'd be surprised what constitutes "dating" for some people.\\I've never really played board games or card games  tbh.\\And don't slam my rubbish TV, it's sometimes nice and relaxing :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh they do loads. Like crafting\/making workshops, I went to their Halloween party and vintage events, they had karaoke last night. Loads of bits and pieces. It's proper nice place, one of my favourites\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I also went to live drawing there and going to bingo next month. Also drag queens, comedy, music nights...\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well I’m pretty confident I’ll find out if your against an idea of mine.\\
I’d like to think I wouldn’t be suprised but people still shock.\\I wasn’t knocking rubbish TV. You’ll see some of what I watch. I’m just aware that sat on the sofa watching TV isn’t really a date. Sometimes it’s all that you can or want to do but it’s not a proper date.\\Oh ok. They do do a lot. Don’t hold it against me too much but I am not a fan of karaoke. Mainly because a lot of the people who sink, shouldn’t :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Right, I’ve got to get ready to go and run around a field in the cold and rain because for some reason I look forward to it. Even though it hurts. :man-facepalming:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, yes, that's a fair assumption.\\
People do still shock. Especially considering you'd think our age group would be better. But isn't.\\Absolutely. Sometimes it's the only thing I'm capable of doing, especially in a flare up but it's not a *proper* date.\\Oh I'd never get up for a karaoke but it can be fun\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I was just going to text you that you needed to leave if you wanted a parking space :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Enjoy!!\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sometimes once you meet people it’s very clear why they are still single. Sometimes I’m left wondering how they get to work in the morning.\\
I think we are on the same page with dates. At least I hope so. Effort is needed but tempered within the time available etc.\\good to know I’m not going to get dragged up on stage to sing badly. I like to save that for car or shower.\\I am pretty sure I made a mistake with one of my tutorials  week so I think I am free Wednesday.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And sometimes you wonder how they haven't been snapped up already...\\
Oh effort is massively high up my list. Equal effort across everything.\\Haha yeah, I smash all the Hamilton songs in a shower. A whole performance.\\Ooh good to know. I've got a late finish on Wednesdays but I'm sure I could find some time after :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well! Kids is a big part of that answer. Most people either already have or want. So that makes it quite hard. Then years of rejection and ghosting mixed with past relationship rejection leaves you (me) with a bit (lot) of a self esteem issues.\\
Then there are others (you) who seem completely oblivious as to why someone would find them interesting and attractive.\\Which you are btw.\\Anyway\\I haven’t seen Hamilton yet :grimacing-face: but we can add theatre to the list.\\Late finish? What 5:30 :grinning-face: (teasing)\\Sat in the car park. It is crap outside today. I should at least crack top 300, so that a bonus.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I'm not oblivious WHY would someone find me interesting and attractive. I'm not meaning to sound conceited or full of myself. I've just done loads of work on myself and had a lot of therapy so I'm quite secure in myself (most of the time). I just didn't realise YOU wanted to ask me out :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Oh Hamilton is brilliant! Saw it in London last year (and million times on Disney). Theatre definitely goes on the list\\Well... Yes. But that's still an 11 hour day!\\Do you have a change of clothes? Wouldn't want you getting sick from sitting in soggy clothes in Starbucks\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And thank you for the compliment :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: (don't stop)\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Still trying to unpick the first bit.\\
Your not the only one who’s done loads of therapy btw :squinting-face-with-tongue:\\No change of clothes. You cannot get sick from being cold anyway.\\Compliments I am working on. I used to have thrown back at me so there a thing I’m working on.\\Time to run around a field for fun!\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have fun! Hope you get the time you want\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: “Fun” was had. That was super slippy and yesterday’s squats have come back to haunt in full force.\\
Have fun with your friend try not to be to distracted thinking about me.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It was painful wasn't it?\\
Did you get the time?\\Haha, thank you. Her flight was delayed so only just getting on the bus.\\Did you go for coffee?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll try very hard not to be distracted :winking-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Don’t think I got the time. Too much mud (that’s the excuse).\\
Pain before. Always hurts after I do squats, regardless of warm up and cool down, then it hurts next day. The running changes the pain. All fun.\\I’ve lived the alternative so this is better.\\Sooo, we could have done an early cute date before parkrun…\\Currently getting a coffee.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We definitely could have considering she bought a direct ticket to Oxford by mistake so I'm now taking the train by myself :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I mean a direct to Oxford would have been a good idea at the start. A pain to get up to hurry up and wait for nothing.\\
Well, enjoy.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah, could have had a lie in or a snuggle instead\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh weird question...\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What's the aftershave\/ perfume you were wearing yesterday?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Snuggle would have been good :winking-face:\\
Erm, soap :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\It’s a Hugo boss one.\\That not that high on the weird scale.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I do like snuggles.\\
Haha, just wondering because it smelled nice\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've had a change of plans...\\
I won't be going to Oxford, in too much pain for gallivanting around. They are going to catch up and my friend will come here after.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, sorry your in pain and missing out.\\
What does the … mean?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah it happens. I'm seeing my Irish friend anyway and I'll catch up with the Oxford friend another weekend. Really can't let this get to me.\\
I'm not sure. I think I was just continuing my thoughts..\\What's your plan for today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s the key. Trying to not let things get to you.\\
Currently at my parents for a drink and lunch. Then the afternoon is all open. Lots of options of things that need doing. Just will pick. So I’m available…\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What does ... mean?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think my friend might be coming back around 4ish.\\
I'll be home and resting until then ...\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: If it's not too much, 3 consecutive days and my half broken flat won't be judged :face-with-tears-of-joy: I could definitely offer a cup of tea\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Will withhold judgement :grinning-face: should be around 2 but will update you.\\
What your address?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. Let me know\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 4 Birches Rise HP12 3AQ\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just got home and need to shower. Will let you know when I’m leaving.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okie doke. I'm home :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
What’s the flat number and do I need to park anywhere special. Don’t want to immediately make a bad impression with the neighbours\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: So the building is on the right side of the T junction, the one before last. I can see from my window there are spaces by the fence opposite and also on the verge right in front of the carpark. The only visitor space in the carpark is the one right at the top on right hand side by the bush fence thing :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Flat is 4, first floor\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Leaving now\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: See you in a bit\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Voice call, 1 min\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I really enjoyed this afternoon, thank you.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Wednesday. I have found this\\
\url{https://facebook.com/events/s/wednesday-quiz-night/184447664338427/}\\There is a chance you’d turn into a pumpkin again. Plus we’d need to sort food.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It was lovely seeing you. Thank you for coming x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Alternative ideas that come to mind\\
We go out for dinner somewhere\\I cook. Steak or spaghetti carbonara are on offer and I have a monopoly card game which is fun.\\You could try and teach me how to make hats.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh cute ideas!\\
I'd say could we save the quiz for later as I'm having three long work days this week and I think it would wipe me out.\\Would having a dinner be a proper date? Because I'd like that :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think it counts as a date if we (you) say it counts as a date. :grinning-face:\\
Let’s do that. Is it dinner out or me cooking it?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okay let's count it as a date :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
What would you prefer? Half and half on decisions\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: So, I’d rather save going out out for dinner for night(s) with less time constraints as then it doesn’t matter what happens. So I’d go with me cooking as the option.\\
That does mean you need to pick the food out of the 2 options I gave :grinning-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ooh I haven't had steak in an age :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: but only if it's not too much trouble\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How is your evening going?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Steak it is and it no more or less trouble than any other cooking.\\
Erm, I may have sat down and only just got up to make dinner :grinning-face:.\\I assume you and your friend who name escapes me are getting all dressed up to hit the club?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It will be steak and chips if that’s ok?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Brill ! Looking forward to it.\\
Haha, what did you do sitting down?\\Haha, me and Dee are just catching up on the sofa. Pizza in the oven, non alc mulled wine for me and normal one for her. The party will be epic!!\\What are you up to after dinner?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup perfect! Peppercorn sauce?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Peppercorn sauce yes but don’t judge me on it.\\
Well I sat down, recovered from seeing you, watched some you tube video and 2 hours was  gone. I only wanted to watch the qualifying highlights.\\Currently making a pizza. With a base I have made from scratch.\\If it not clear. I can cook. On Wednesday you can check the folder for future meals.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I would never judge you on that. Happy with a store bought :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
Why did you have to recover?\\Ooh nice. What are you putting on it?\\Oh good to know! I shall have a look\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well it will be store bought. Never had much luck making it and somehow even less luck with store bought. So it’s a dice roll.\\
Just cheese on the pizza, keep it simple but I do always have 4 or so different cheeses in the house.\\Like you can’t work out why I might have needed some time to bring my heart rate down.\\You turned me on. A lot! Especially right at the end, which I’m suspecting might have been on purpose so that I had an awkward walk to the car.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I can help with the sauce then.\\
Oh we had salami and goats cheese.\\It definitely wasn't on purpose :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: but good to know!\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Help in what way? This store bought one has a chance of being on. It isn’t a packet mix.\\
Oh nice.\\Sure it wasn’t :winking-face:\\What is the party up to now that dinner is finished?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: So what can go wrong with it if it just needs heating up?\\
Promise it wasn't . But I'm pleased by the effect I might have had.\\Hope it's not made you uncomfortable\\Oh it's wild. We're watching The Morning Show and I'm making a hat :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\What are you up to?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: A simple question but I don’t know what can go wrong with it. Sometimes it’s just odd.\\
The only discomfort was in walking to the car :grinning-face: otherwise it’s kind of the effect your meant to have on me. I’m not entirely sure I’m having a similar effect on you.\\Calm down. The morning show in the evening!\\How many hats are you trying to make?\\I’m just watching “First Man”\\I’m slightly obsessed with the space race and pretty much everything NASA did in the 60’s\\It’s one of the reasons I like F1. It’s the only thing I think happening today that matches the “get it done” attitude that NASA had.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Why are you thinking that?\\
Haha, it's a TV show on Apple TV\\Oh cool. Is it good?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It isn’t super obvious with women anyway. Your a little difficult to read but I’ll get better. It’s a big past relationship trauma thing for me that I have to keep trying to ignore. Also I was well aware that you were in pain and not feeling 100\% so that can’t exactly be the right state to be in for me to have that great of an effect.\\
Oh, that makes a lot more sense.\\I like it, it’s quite long but pretty accurate to history. Certainly not for everyone. Very gritty in terms of how it was shot and it has the person right near the end of who I’d have wanted to be if I was alive at that time. I’ll keep the answer a secret until we meet.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Which part is difficult to read? I'm genuinely interested\\
Have you worked through the trauma thing in therapy?\\Hah ok. Intrigued\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ve really dug a hole for myself now.\\
So, yes I’ve worked through a lot of it in therapy but there is still this voice in my head that says “your not good enough” and “people don’t like you”.\\A lot of the time it’s quiet but sometimes that voice gets louder and becomes more difficult for me to shut it up.\\An example being when I’m getting intimate with someone (you to be clear). The voice can be there “they don’t like you. Don’t do that. There going to get mad”\\Even though logically afterwards that cannot be true otherwise I wouldn’t be in the situation for the voice to start.\\Therapy has made a huge difference but the insecurity still comes back and annoyingly it come back worst when I really like someone.\\Hope that makes sense and doesn’t paint me as a crazy person.\\As for the reading thing. I’ll get better. Just cannot work out what your thinking. I suspect a lot of what I was seeing today was you suppressing pain. Which would get in the way.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not necessarily. As I said I'm genuinely interested.\\
We all have a little voice like that. It's all just about how we respond to it I guess. Have you thought about your attachment style? There's a really good book out there on them.\\It doesn't paint you crazy.\\What was it that you were seeing today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well I’m glad it doesn’t paint me as crazy.\\
I’ve seen a fair amount on the attachment styles. I forget the full list and I’m not sure what the test would show me as now. I’d need a book on how to go from what ever one isn’t secure to the secure attachment. Although I’m not sure if it possible for people to switch attachment styles.\\I’ve done the love languages book. That was interesting. Even if you don’t like the idea of the 5 languages the ideas and examples of how people feel loved and appreciated made a lot of sense.\\Erm, I could see you were in discomfort, a bit tired but could also see that you pleased I was there.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You can definitely switch, or learn to switch, from anxious to secure.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I absolutely believe in the love languages.\\
Have you found out what yours was?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: All of those observations check out :face-with-tears-of-joy: I get self conscious when I'm not 100\% and often feel like I have to compensate for not feeling well\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ordered\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: My top 2 were acts of service and quality time. Yours?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think I did ok then. I’ll have to watch the compensation thing.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Let me know how it is when you read it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hopefully it’s an easier read than my quantum mechanics book :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sorry, was just doing the test :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Acts of service and words of affirmation\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I just feel I have to be more "on" and not to be a burden on someone. I'm still getting to grips with all of this and according to therapy I'm going through the 5 stages of grief\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Noted. I’m really working on giving out compliments.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That goes on the list.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I don’t know why but shouldn’t the pillow be at the other end?\\
I did offer…. :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'd like to hear more about this if\/when you want to tell me\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well you need to start asking me stuff from the list. So far we've just been putting stuff on it :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: On the 5 stages of grief thing have you been told that once you reach the end you can back around. That was not fun when I was told.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nah, this is the raised side. It's really not comfy.\\
Very generous offer. But I couldn't just leave my friend could I :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well, we do have a LOT more to talk about than we have already spoken about so the list will grow for a while.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I don’t know how much there is to say. I’ve had many times over many years where I say something nice and it was then somehow thrown back at me as a negative because of something in the past.\\
The classic comedian example being “You like nice today” “Oh so I looked like crap yesterday” etc\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That sounds more like a them problem rather than you doing something wrong\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think this is a nice difference difference between men a women. First of all a man probably isn’t giving up his bed so that his friend can sleep in while while he sleeps on the sofa.\\
Second, in that scenario I’m a pretty sure most men would 100\% leave their friend in their place to go and sleep with their girlfriend.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha we definitely do!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's very true\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yes it is but all it taught me was not to say nice things as it only got a negative reaction.\\
Thus the learning to get better at given them.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We all have learning and working to make ourselves the best version to do. One day at a time :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to try to get some sleep. And if I remember right you have an early start!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night. Sleep well\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night. Yes I probably should have been asleep for a while :man-facepalming:\\
\section*{Sunday $19\textsuperscript{th}$}
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Morning. How was the sofa bed?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning! It wasn't great, I feel like a broken toy :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
How's the F1?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, that’s no fun.\\
I did provide an alternative. Cannot claim you’d have got more sleep but would have been more comfortable :winking-face:\\Other than it being stupid early it is actually turning out to be a much better race than I thought.\\Do you have a plan for the day yet?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You did. But you know why I didn't take up the offer :face-with-tears-of-joy: and also, it might be a bit of an early days for sleepovers, no?\\
Oh glad you're enjoying it.\\Not yet. But I need to smash out a job application before my friend wakes up. Then we'll have breakfast and see what she wants to do.\\What's your plan?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I do know why but still going joke about it. As for sleep overs, I don’t know that there are any rules about this sort of thing. Or I don’t have any rules. Just when it’s comfortable. I mean it will be awkward but a comfortable awkward.\\
Job application?? That’s on the list. What’s the role?\\Not really sure on my plans. I’ve got to sort out the craft show as a minimum for today. Maybe some games. For now, some more sitting.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well I did tell you about me and sleepovers on Friday. Usually need to know someone quite well to submit them to the snoring :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
It's a cyber security advisor with the civil service. Deadline is today so really need to get it done.\\Yes the craft show!! Hope all that goes well. Happy to advise but don't know how much help I'd be :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And ALSO, why is it going to be awkward?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not the job role I would have guess even though I already knew it wasn’t going to be a teacher role. Good luck with it.\\
I like how you picked up the awkward comment after :grinning-face:\\The snoring isn’t an issue. Once I’m asleep I’m asleep.\\I’m getting good at digging holes for myself :man-facepalming:\\As for awkward this might be another one of those men and women differences or a me thing. It’s something I can get stuck in my head about and I always feel a certain pressure to not disappoint. So, while it will no doubt be very fun I also don’t want to make a complete mess of it.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What did you think I was going to say for the job?\\
I'm not sure how you can mess up sleeping? Are you going to kick me? Is your bed uncomfortable? Do you talk in your sleep and I will find out all your darkest secrets?\\Joking aside. One does need to get out of their head. Being in one's head too much can impact an experience. Easier said than done, I know\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I don’t know what job I was thinking. You keep surprising me. Cyber security is super nerd and not even close to teaching children a language. Although now I’ve typed that you will have be teach adults some common sense. So maybe it more similar than I think.\\
Oh yeah funny. Let’s pretend I wasn’t talking about sex :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\My bed is super comfy btw.\\Slowly getting better at not getting so stuck but it is annoyingly slow progress sometimes. Already I’m less worried now that I’ve said something. There is deeper reasoning which is a later thing.\\The take away is that I’m very keen that both of us are enjoying ourselves.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think we've established I am a super nerd :nerd-face:\\
Haha, let's!\\You know what they say. Rome wasn't built in a day. If anything therapy taught me it's that anything worth having takes work, especially work on oneself.\\And as for the enjoyment, that comes from knowing what makes the other person (and oneself) tick, no one size fits all :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well your super nerd status is still up in the air. Nerd yes, super though. We will see and compare.  I mean, you did have to get off the sofa yesterday to turn the light on… not really super nerd level :grinning-face:\\
Very true. Pretty much everything worth doing or having takes hard work.\\That exploration is certainly fun. It just doesn’t stop there being some awkwardness.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Do super nerds function in the dark?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think I might have finished the personal statement, just need to tighten it up now. Hate this part\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well, a nerd would have multiple ways to turn the lights on…\\
Happy to give it a read if you like. Also get ChatGPT to read it and give feed back.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: haha, I had chat gtp help write it :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: but yes please for input!\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: Send me the word\\
Paul.busby@outlook.com\\And the role.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: oki\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I normally do the feedback as comments directly in word. Then you can either change stuff or delete the comment.\\
I’ll go at it with never little context and in the context of me hiring.\\I did used to be responsible for hiring consultants.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sent. It has to be anonymised hence the lack of everything identifying on there\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just making a cup of tea and I’ll get to it.\\
What is your go to tea? I’ll add to my shopping this week.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: aw cute. Earl grey with lemon :)\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I try\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: omg, now you have my full name :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I already have your surname\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: from where????\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Facebook\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: that's not it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :thinking-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't have my full name on FB\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did you think my last name was End?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Purely based on Facebook, yes\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: My private investigator hasn’t given me there full report yet\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is a joke btw\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :woman-shrugging-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: hahah, I know\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just checked my email. So Facebook doesn’t have either of your names right :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: incognito :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just getting into it now. SC clearance could be an annoying pain.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't mind that. My notice period is a joke\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And I need a foot in, without a horrendous pay cut. And they are good with disabilities and pensions\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: that's not the potential issue. Its the not born in this country potential issue. Minor of SC but can prevent you getting DV and you might never be allowed to see UK eyes only stuff\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: of = for\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: no I satisfy all the nationality requirements\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I'm just jumping forward 3 jobs. Once your in the opportunities ramp up\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll cross that bridge if\/when I get there :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: yeah, just a real pain you can't do much about. At least its an EU country.\\
Its an interesting industry to work in.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I can get a passport\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: is there a word limit on the statement?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 1200\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Am I over? didn't even check for the first draft\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: your only at 440 word currently\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I checked. I'm well under. But I hate waffling. What would you suggest?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: let me finish reading it first :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am impatient :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I read slow\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: right, send back. Some of the comments might read as being blunt. None of it is meant as an attack.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Overall I think you just need to evidence some of the claims you are making. You also do not mention anything nerdy at all and I already know that you have done nerd stuff they would be interested in.\\
Don't allow them to assume anything that you want them to assume. Make it explicit.\\Example. Rather than you assume that I like you. I'll just tell you.\\I like you! :grinning-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well I'm humbled\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: expand?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I thought it was quite good\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: it is. It can just be improved :grinning-face:\\
You've only at a 3rd of the word limit, so you have plenty of scope to slap them in the face with all the evidence and great reasons why they should consider you\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to take some of them on board. This is just one part of the application, there's a second one where I'm evidencing the behaviours they are asking about\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The nerd bits are a good point\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: in a previous life I was reading a lot of CV's. SOO many cv's and personal statements. While I was in no way the best. Some application just read better than others even with the same information.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh, if there is a whole another section for evidence then that is good. I'd still hint at it in the personal statement as you want them to keep reading.\\
You have to go "Full American" with these things which I find very uncomfortable. Full on bragging mode. "I'm the best and here is why"\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The problem is that I know I kick ass at this job thing but it's harder to articulate in writing\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: from the role description you would nail it. It is that annoying thing of getting it on paper. So hard to get to that face to face bit.\\
You got this.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't know how to include the being it support effectively\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Is being meant to be something else?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: As me being the IT support\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, maybe that should part of a whole separate paragraph where you talk about nerd stuff.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. I've made some changes\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Can I resend?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sure\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Done\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: returned. Much better. I've added some very picky comments\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: thank you!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I hope it helps\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: made the changes and will finish it now\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It did thank you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also... The show we were supposed to go to tonight\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: oh, that's crap\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: what are you going to do instead?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Dinner and cinema\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: still good. What are you going to watch. Nothing jumped out at me when I looked yesterday\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: the prequel to hunger games if it's on I think\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: it is. I didn't think it was out yet\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think we're going to do the 4pm :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
How's your morning been? Apart from slaving over my statement\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: So you don’t have to worry about turning into a pumpkin again tonight then?\\
Erm, slaving over your statement :grinning-face:. Did watch some maths you tube. Because I’m cool remember.\\Got games booked in for 2pm. I checked and have a bit more to sell than I thought but I might try and make a couple more butt plugs \/ bottle stoppers.\\Just having my usual Sunday lunch of sausage and eggs because I’m an old man who liked his routine :grinning-face:\\You doing anything before the film?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Really hoping it will be an early one.\\
Very nerdy of you :face-with-tears-of-joy: but hope it helped\\Oh as in gaming?\\I think you should try making the butt plugs :face-with-tears-of-joy: there's definite market\\Sausage and eggs? Alright old man.\\And there's nothing wrong with routine. I love mine\\Going to into town and wander around I guess\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah gaming.\\
There definitely is a market for hand turned sex toys. Certainly an interesting conversation starter for when people ask. Technically the issue is with applying the resin.\\But, would you be willing to help me test out prototypes?\\Enjoy town. You’ll get to see the lights. How are you feeling now?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Test out prototypes??\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm not great, have had a headache all morning. But I can't let this be a complete dud of a weekend for my friend\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: If your asking me to make sex toys. The design will need testing….\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Booo, that sucks. Any drugs to take he edge off?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I wasn't asking. Purely a business suggestion :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I've taken some\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well you’ve started it now :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What have I started?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The whole thought process of making sex toys but without considering the impact to yourself.\\
It was a funnier thought in my mind.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Got two dresses for the fight :grimacing-face:\\
How are the games?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done. Stupid question. Did you need 2 :grinning-face:\\
I look forward to seeing them.\\Game are slow. Probably on my last one now and then try something else\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Enjoy the film\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I need to try them on with proper undies and shoes and then will return one.\\
And maybe I did need two :winking-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: <attached: 00000571-GIF-2023-11-19-19-32-22.mp4>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :grinning-face:hello. How was the film? You at dinner now?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It was ... decent. Nothing to rave about I guess. And way too long.\\
Yup just at zizzis. How's your evening?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I saw it was long. I have no idea why they think films need to be nearly 3 hours. 2 is plenty.\\
Evenings ok. Sort of made a bottle stopper but the super glue is misbehaving so had to leave it all to dry.\\Currently watching Rogue One and trying to work out if I will go to bed early to make up for the early start.\\Are you doing anything after dinner?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: When did you see it?\\
How is super glue misbehaving?\\We're just heading home. I need to get ready for tomorrow\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I haven’t seen the movie. I noticed it was super long when I looked it up.\\
I think it was too cold. It is very sensitive to temperature and humidity. It basically wasn’t drying as fast as it should. Happens about half the time.\\Did you get the job application all sorted out?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aaah ok! It is super long :sleeping-face:\\
That's like me in cold and damp :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\I did! All sent and now I wait. Hopefully not too long as deadline is today. But last time I waited 5 weeks for invitation to interview so who knows.\\Did you decide whether it's going to be an early one?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Been trying to think of something funny to your coke and damp comment but I got nothing. Must be tired.\\
Hopefully you won’t have to wait too long. Will all depend on if they are trying to get it done before Christmas or not.\\I mean, it needs to an early one.  If it happens or not will all be done to how much procrastination I do.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aaah, not on form tonight are we?\\
CS recruitment takes an absolute age. If it happens before the deadline in Feb I'll be happy. Nothing I can do now anyway\\Well off to bed you go!\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Certainly not on top form tonight.\\
All IT stuff takes forever. I gave soo much notice and they hadn’t even really started interviewing until after I left.\\If Feb there deadline or yours?\\I will be in a bit. I get a lie in compared to you 5:50\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Why not on top form?\\
It's not even IT. It's just the civil service way. It's usually about 9 months between application and start date\\Oh you do! Why are you up so early?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just tired. Very annoying really as you cannot fake not being tired. You just have to try again again tomorrow.\\
So is the Feb deadline there’s or yours?\\I’ve got spin class in the morning at 7am at buzz. I still hurt from squats, so  should be fun.\\Are you going to be stalking me in the gym again tomorrow evening?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh don't I know that!\\
Oh sorry, it's my deadline if leaving end of April. The next one is may for end of August.\\Oh that will hurt! Do you take Epsom salt baths?\\I'm not sure tbh. Detention duty and then seeing Katie. Depends how I'm feeling. This weekend has really wiped me\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: So you have to give a whole terms notice to leave?\\
Don’t have any Epsom salts but sometimes have baths. Just didn’t this weekend.\\Well I hope you feel better tomorrow.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah pretty much :face-with-rolling-eyes:\\
I buy these wonderful CBD bath salts and they do wonders for me. Will take you to Marlow market with me next time\\Thank you :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: me too. I hate being whingy\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And it's definitely not a good early days impression on my part either,:face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Your doing great. You cannot help being ill. It’s not something you can control.\\
You still made a huge effort to see me on Friday and Saturday and I really appreciate that.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well you're quite good company so..\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Right, gotta set up my torture device of a bed <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I do try but good to know. :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not to brag too much I’m already in bed and it’s very comfy. Trying not to think to hard about you trying on cute dresses in different underwear\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha. How do you know they are cute?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I might have to get some new under bits because I'm a comfy girl and these are not comfy girl dresses\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Until I see them I just assume\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Erm, happy to help judge different lingerie.\\
You know. If it helps you.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha I'm sure you are. So helpful :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s a selfless act for sure.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Definitely. What a sacrifice on your part \#saint\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Glad we are in the same page :face-with-tears-of-joy: remember to bring up my selflessness and sainthood when you tell your friends about me.\\
You could always bring some samples with you on Wednesday. Just to get started\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Chancer\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00000602-GIF-2023-11-19-21-47-18.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You did\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I should probably let you get some rest. We can get back to you looking amazing in various different clothing later in the week.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah you're good, I'm still pottering around. But I guess you should probably try to sleep\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The sensible ideas normally are the least fun.\\
Night.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night. Sleep well\\

\section*{Monday $20\textsuperscript{th}$}
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Morning. Hope you have a good day and was able to creep out of your flat successfully.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning!\\
Thank you. I'm still here, everything is taking me just a little longer trying to be quiet :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\Hope the spin class is good and doesn't hurt too much.\\What are you up to today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well, spin was neither good or pain free. Not a terrible class and at least there was 8 of us just the instructor is very odd.\\
Still hurt from Friday which I do not like. Never mind. All needs to be done.\\Today is a bit of cooking and then all uni. Hopefully I can quickly do the project work and then get a chapter done on Stars. Which should be ok.\\Hope your day goes well.\\Is Katie the women you did the marathon with? What you doing?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You should definitely take a bath to ease the DOMS.\\
Oh what are you cooking? Are you meal prepping?\\Do you have a PT and tutorial tonight?\\Yup, Katie is the one you used to see at gymfit spin classes and the one I did the marathon with.\\Just catching up, maybe or walk or something\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That a good idea. I can squeeze in a quick bath.\\
It’s a little bit of meal prep but only 2 meals worth. I’ve got all the stuff for half a chilli as the last time I made it I had enough sauce to freeze. I normal meal prep for the week on a Monday. Trying to use up the stuff in my freezer so that I can go back to Huel for a while. Gotta get the eating back in check.\\Yeah got PT as well and then a tutorial. At least PT will be a nice rest :face-with-tears-of-joy:.\\I still cannot place Katie. Hopefully it’s a good thing you know all these people that are aware of me.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: So we're both not going to be chewing our lunches :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Busy Monday for you!\\Hahaha, you got glowing recommendation from her sooo..\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Pretty much yeah. I have ordered some of their “meal pouches” which sound very appetising (sarcasm) but I do like a hot lunch.\\
I’m busy every day :grinning-face: being unemployed is very time consuming.\\I did! What did she say? I like her more already\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: My friend said the hot meals were alright actually. He was on them for a while.\\
Haha, well for one she didn't say you were married :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\No but really, she said you were really lovely\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Can I be honest?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s apparently the best policy\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm not used to such thoughtfulness :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Elderflower cordial is pretty much the only thing I drink\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, that is sad. Just seems like a nice thing to do. I got some other stuff for Wednesday as well.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It is a very nice thing. It's something I'd normally do. But doesn't often happen vice versa\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh what else did you get?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well Katie got that wrong as I was married :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Glad I come across well in the gym though.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Tea but I already said that. Found some elderflower and orange tonic. Thought it was worth a try and sparkling water.\\
Nothing crazy.\\Oh and pudding.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh all my favourite things.... Are you sure you didn't do more research on me? First the Thai food and now this.\\
What pud did you get?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think I’d like to say yes but I didn’t. Got lucky with Thai food but it’s also a logical good choice (in my mind) for a date.\\
As for the rest it’s just listening.\\A man has to keep some secrets :grinning-face: you’ll have to wait until Wednesday\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm being really told off at work today :confused-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: For being poorly and being here :grimacing-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I was going to ask how you were feeling. Are they sending you home?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Teaching is very different but I have had to explain to more people that I would have expected that if you’re not well enough to do work that a client is paying for. Not doing the work and taking the day off and rescheduling the day is better.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No, I kinda dug my heels in. I only have registration and the det duty on today so it would be a waste of a sick day. I don't need to stay for the open evening tomorrow now. (And i really want to hold out until Thursday)\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's very true in the outside world but unfortunately I can't reschedule anything. If a lesson is missed, it's missed, I'm not getting the time back\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Do you a specific number of sick days or you just try and keep them low.\\
On the plus side at least this helps with Thursday.\\I have another theory that you have to take 2 days off anyway.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not with a disability, but I really try not to take the piss. I've had 3 so far this year. If I'm not better by Wednesday I'll stay home\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I hate it! I'm a terrible sick person :face-with-tears-of-joy: and I just try to push through\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you sure you're wanting to get involved with this fine specimen of a broken human?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Doesn’t pushing through make it worse \/ take longer to get better?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yes\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Isn’t the logical best thing then to take the days as needed so your back up and running faster…\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes ..\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Please refer to the first sentence\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I got it. I think most people are bad at being sick. I’m not sure I’ve met someone who enjoyed it but I can only imagine how frustrating it is when it happens a lot and you’re just trying to get stuff done.\\
Everything is harder when you don’t feel good.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sooo, does this mean there is an opening for a repeat of Friday?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: This was obviously on the assumption you were going to stay being a terrible sick person.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah, it's the frustration more than anything else\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What do you mean?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Drop in for a cup of tea.\\
Which isn’t a date :grinning-face: but also want to maximise Wednesday. So if you resting etc is better then definitely do that.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Wednesday is definitely happening! I might end up being off work, but I'll need to eat :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I like the thinking. As a bonus it’s got to be better that I’m cooking so you don’t have to worry about it.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You cooking for me is very much appreciated at any time :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: A bold statement from someone who hasn’t eaten my food yet :grinning-face:\\
I much prefer cooking when someone else is also going to eat. Makes the mess worthwhile\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well I appreciate the gesture regardless of the end product\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ooooh. You need to tell me how it is.\\
Haha, I'm literally just going to sit in her kitchen for an hour.\\Enjoy the PT sesh!\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: i'll start reading it tonight.\\
well sitting in the kitchen can still be fun. My theory is that when people are young they have nothing to talk about, thus the need for clubs and loud places. Once you get older there is actually stuff to discuss. So you prefer a quiet place to chat. Hopefully you didn't bore her talking about me too much:grinning-face:\\I thought I would be lifting heavy things. NOPE. all pain and small weights\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You still went and that's achievement enough!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope the tutorial went well and maths didn't give you a headache\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: very true. I am not a fan of the hamstring curl machine.\\
Tutorial was good thanks. Just about ok with the maths and very interesting concepts. The whole concept of dark energy does seem to be a massive fudge factor that is needed to make the math match what we can observe and measure. Does make you wonder if how we are observing could be wrong or has the dark energy and dark mater always been there and our physical universe is expanding through \/ into it.\\How are you doing?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Cards on the table?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: always\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've had a really shit day and it all came to a head. I've had a very big cry at Katie's and just got home.\\
I will be okay. But I just need to sit with it and get my head straight.\\Hope this doesn't sound too crazy. Just wanted to let you know in case I'm a bit quieter tonight\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I'm sorry you had a shit day. I did sense something.\\
Hopefully the cry was helpful.\\Not too crazy at all. I'm about to make dinner and will then probably go to bed anyway. We can talk properly in person. As I said, deep stuff is better face to face and if you need some quiet space we can txt tomorrow\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you. I probably should eat too.\\
Please don't make me cry to your face :face-with-tears-of-joy: I can't seem to be able to stop\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Enjoy your dinner!\\
Hope you managed to squeeze in a bath.\\Distraction could help but I will probably go to bed earlier tonight too\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: food always helps.\\
Obviously I dont want to make you cry. That doesn't create the best summary of a date :grinning-face: but things happen.\\Sometimes its about getting the "stuff" out and its amazing how much a shower, some food and a sleep will help.\\You take the things you can control, make that into a plan, sorted. The things you cannot control, you try not to worry about them because they cannot be controlled.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, I'll do my best.\\
Yeah, it's important to get stuff out. Just wasn't expecting it tonight.\\I wish it was a quick and easy fix but I guess that wouldn't be real life.\\Right, things will happen one way or another I guess\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: What the saying.\\
Nothing worth having is easy.\\Something like that.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well you might just have to get used to them\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Because you are quite a lovely human\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thanks, see above picture for my reaction.\\
You too btw.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll just keep on going and one day it will take\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Can’t hurt to try.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well, depends on what you’re trying. Maybe a poor choice of words\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't be too excited about the prospect of me giving you compliments \/s :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to get myself to bed.\\
Thank you for understanding and distracting me. Appreciate it :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night. Sleep well\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night.\\

\section*{Tuesday $21\textsuperscript{st}$}
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00000687-GIF-2023-11-21-06-14-56.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning!\\
Yes definitely better being in my own bed :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\I will be going in today (I left all my things there yesterday so need picking up otherwise I would have stayed off).\\Sorry I wasn't on my best form yesterday!\\How are you today? What's the Tuesday plan?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: People are allowed to be sick and have off days. It’s how they bounce back that shows the strength of character.\\
I take it that means you’re feeling a little better this morning?\\Whoops on the stuff.\\I am very excited to see your best form :winking-face:\\I doing great today, so far.\\So, spin class again this morning and then just flat out with uni. Didn’t get quite as much done yesterday as I would have like due to spending well over an hour trying to talk to a doctor. Sometimes you cannot even make up the issues. So need to see if I can resolve that without it consuming the day.\\Then maybe some games after my tutorial this evening.\\What is your day looking like?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm not sure whether it's better or just type of "gotta get through this" determination. Get through today, try to get a GP app tomorrow and deal with this. That's the plan so far.\\
Haha, I'm excited for you to see it too!\\I'm glad you're great!\\Is everything okay re the doctor?\\Depending on how I'm feeling after work, I might go for a walk or gym. That's as far as I've gotten :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Either way a positive mindset has to help.\\
As for me and the doctor the joke is that I don’t know. I think it is but need them to tell me. Until then it could be anywhere between completely fine and not. I’m choosing to assume that the lack luster approach they have taken is a good sign.\\Good luck with getting your appointment.\\Doesn’t sound like a bad plan for a Tuesday.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well I hope everything is alright.\\
In any case, here if you need a chat or anything :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\Hope spin class is good and you don't hurt too much!\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thanks, I do appreciate that. At the moment nothing to talk about other than how I ended up in this situation. Can tell you tomorrow. Hopefully all a waste of time.\\
Spin was pretty good.\\Hope your day goes well.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Can't wait to hear about it.\\
And look forward to seeing you tomorrow\\Glad you had a good class.\\Have a good, productive day and hope you get to finish all the uni work\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m really looking forward to tomorrow as well.  You’ll have to let me know what time works for you.\\
I can probably guess the answer but don’t want to assume things. You’re very welcome to stay over tomorrow. I don’t have a super early start Thursday and I know you need to sort your flat out.  None of my smooth reasoning will work :grinning-face:\\Getting it all done would be a huge stretch but it’s all about making progress.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What would you have guessed?\\
That's a really lovely offer. But I do have to sort my flat out so will be an early start on my end, and I would need to get back to the furry overlord\\I'm sure we'd have another opportunity (when I'm not having my ceiling ripped down)\\Haha, you know what I meant. Get everything that you need today done\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I would have guessed no mainly due to the furry overlord. I'd never have left my dogs overnight alone and assumed the same with cats. Not that either would probably care given all they do is sleep all night.\\
Early is relative, I'd just thought neither of us would need a 5am something alarm.\\I'm certainly we have lots of other opportunities. Will be a real disaster if tomorrow is the only one :grinning-face:\\Any luck getting your appointment?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah, it's weird. I don't mind leaving him a few hours but try not to overnight.\\
What time shall I be aiming for by the way?\\Haha, I'm sure we will have other opportunities!\\I can only call in tomorrow morning, my surgery doesn't do pre-booked :face-with-rolling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Timing tomorrow is sort of up to you as I will be at home so I really don't mind.\\
It is the absolute dumbest thing that you cannot book an appointment for a time beyond today. Could you get one for later today?\\I've made some progress with mine but now I need to make an appointment :man-facepalming: Just tell me over the phone and stop wasting all the time.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I could probably do like 5 or 6 depending whether I get an appointment and when.\\
Honestly I'm so over the surgeries. I can't get an appointment ever.\\I won't be able to get one today because they all go in the morning.\\Oh good luck with your appointment!\\How's uni work going?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That time works. Nice and early. I like that.\\
Mine splits them in half. All rubbish.\\Works gone ok. This one is making sense. The exercises are more time consuming than I would have liked. It’s bad when it was quicker to write code than trust the calculator.\\Just to throw it out there. If you fancy a hug on your way home. You know where I live…\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Even though I look like death warmed over?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You said that last week and you looked great.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly not the case today :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well, the offer is there.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I just don't want you to run away :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I can’t exactly run very far in my own house :face-with-tears-of-joy: and I’m assuming you haven’t had any children run screaming in fear from the class room.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You'd be surprised how much they put up with :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll text when I'm leaving\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Looking forward to it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm just about to leave. Shall I pop by?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: yes, but only if you want to\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: <attached: 00000713-AUDIO-2023-11-21-15-37-38.opus>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: see you in a bit\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm here\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you very much for the tea and snuggles :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: your very welcome. I'm surprised, in a good way, how comfortable it all feels.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah it does, doesn't it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: exciting and scary all at once. Glad you think the same.\\
Good luck with getting you cover sorted.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah very much so. But at least we're excited and scared at the same time :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
I'm going to try some food and get to it.\\Hope the tutorial is not too brain melting\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Very true.\\
Sounds like a good plan of attack.\\I hope so. It’s only an hour so how bad can it really be!\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Famous last words :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: \url{https://www.westwycombewalledgarden.com/ticketed-events/pottery1}\\
Also, an idea for down the line\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good plan. I was going to ask the potter I know at the craft fair next week as she does classes as well.\\
I guess we’d go for the Wednesday class :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yes, do ask your friend!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00000726-GIF-2023-11-21-20-06-31.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy: how was it?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I was really good. just a lot of info to take in over an hour\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Dinner now?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: already ate before. Otherwise it would have been worse\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh at least that! Chilled evening now then?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, I started watching Focus at lunch. I'll probably go an finish that.\\
Have you got your cover sorted?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not yet :confused-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i'm guessing its not quite as simple as giving them a video to watch\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha I wish. Need to make worksheets\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: chatGPT - make me worksheets :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I wish!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Done :smiling-face: now just to wake up at 6 to call in\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done.\\
Urgh, that is early. You can’t email it in now?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No, unfortunately need to call in in the morning.\\
Are you having a lie in tomorrow?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: A bit of one yeah. Gotta phone doctors at 8am. Still much better than the 5:50 alarm.\\
I guess 6am is an hour extra for you?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Indeed it is. And then can have a little nap before calling the drs\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Such fun getting old :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh we are living the rock N rol life\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think that would be more tiring\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: My party days are definitely behind me\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Day time ones are better.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Definitely!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I did ask you what your plans were for your bday one but don't think you told me\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I didn’t. Quite simple. People come over. There is food and drink. People leave.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Means you can talk to people a bit easier unlike going to a restaurant or something and you can hear each other because strangers aren’t being annoying\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you having lots of people?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not sure about lots. I need to chase some people. Maybe 8 at the moment\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's a nice, intimate party number\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not that type of party :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah damn!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Interesting\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I do have a friend that took his ex to a few sex clubs. He didn’t do a very good job of selling them as a good idea\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah. Well that's a story I want to hear\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Somehow this is from the same friend who first time with said ex. She asked him “have you actually done this before”\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh lord :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: He was that good, ha?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I assume he got better or less flustered.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Fingers crossed, for her :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Although now that I’ve said that story. Even if you think it don’t ask me the same thing.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I would never!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm just going to assume you have\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: A somewhat safe assumption given what you already know of my past.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But... A "somewhat" safe assumption?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just a funny way of saying it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okay okay\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: As always there is stuff in the past to be aware of but not over txt and nothing bad. Let’s just say I’ve not always had the best of luck with partners.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh :eyes: Now I'm very intrigued <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good :grinning-face:\\
There is a hint in one of my deal breakers.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think I get the gist\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Probably a good thing. It created a few insecurities that I’m battling hard to overcome.\\
I am very excited to explore all of that stuff with you. When the time is right.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Rejection from a partner can do that to you. (I'm majorly assuming\/projecting so correct me if I'm wrong)\\
Ditto.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also... Speaking of which... The time will unfortunately not be right tomorrow due to unexpected reasons :grimacing-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Bingo. Although this was only with my ex wife. At one point I was going to see if I could go back on antidepressants so that it wouldn’t bother me so much.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, sounds like exactly the right timing from the universe.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's shit\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly :face-with-rolling-eyes: but probably the stress lately buggered up the timings\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just so it’s covered off. I was only on antidepressants for about 4 months when I was 22.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The stress will do that. Does make the timing funny.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly, I wouldn't care if you were on the now\/long term. We all need to do what helps us be best us\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Doesn't it just\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I agree. Just wanted to throw it out there\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And I appreciate it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Cards on the table and all. Right?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I really do appreciate how open you've been thus far :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's nice\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thanks, I try to be open. If you ask a question I will try to answer although I will probably then ask you the same.\\
What I will tell you I am quite bad at is not talking about something I want to unless someone asks. Always getting better but I know it’s one of my big things to be consistent on in  a relationship\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I also sort of have a rule. Don’t ask questions you don’t want the answer to.\\
It’s meant in a funny way and applys very much to work type stuff but also in personal things\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You know I'm very open and value communication so ask away\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But unfortunately I can't read minds so you will have to tell me when you want to talk about something. I won't be able to ask if I don't know :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And this is the hilarious issue it creates.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You know I have questions. Will get into some of them tomorrow.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good! I'm happy to answer\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You say that now :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Explain to me the Einstein field equation? :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Definitely not those kind of questions\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Anything else, I'm game\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Right, I'm all snuggled in bed and will try to get some sleep for the big day tomorrow\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sounds good. Night.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night. Sleep well x\\
\section*{Wednesday $22\textsuperscript{nd}$}
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Morning. Did you manage to phone into work ok?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning! Yup, called in, texted the dept and had a half hour nap :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Now onto the GP.\\Did you sleep well?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sounds like a good start to the day.\\
Pretty well yeah.\\Good luck with the GP\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good luck with yours!\\
What's the plan for the day?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well, I’m not seeing the doctor :man-facepalming:25 minutes on hold but there are no appointments. I do have an appointment for Tuesday next week which they somehow couldn’t give me yesterday. It baffles me how much of everyone’s time they are able to waste. Feels like such an easy problem to fix.\\
So just uni work again. Trying to catch up as yesterday took a while.\\Then this girl really like is coming over for dinner. So I’m looking forward to that.\\How did you get on?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh well that's crap. But at least you now have an appointment.\\
I waited for 20mins, got to position 1 and it disconnected me so had to start again. Just spoke to them, they put me on triage and will call back with an appointment. When? No one knows\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That sounds even less successful than my attempt. So now you just have to hurry up and wait:man-facepalming:\\
Had you planned to do anything else during the day?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Exactly :face-with-rolling-eyes:\\
I just have to get the bathroom ready. And I really wanted a nap\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And I have this lovely dinner planned for me later so that's a thing I'm looking forward to. And apparently it's going to be good company too\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Can you nap with your phone on loud?\\
Won’t the builder fix it man or whoever sort the bathroom?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't think I'd rest knowing I'm waiting for a call.\\
He'll do the ripping and fixing but I need to get all the stuff out\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’d be the same but then I’m bad at napping as well.\\
Oh that makes more sense.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll teach you how to nap. I'm a master! And it comes part and parcel of my thingy :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Fair warning, if it’s during the day and we are in bed. Napping is not going to be \#1 on my list. \#2 at best\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I can nap on a sofa too\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m actually not sure why I even said during the day.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Because obviously night time bedtime is for sleep\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You can have sex on a sofa as well :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You'd stick to your sofa!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I didn’t say it was my greatest idea.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: There are benefits to fabric sofas :woman-shrugging-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well, not as easy to clean but I may have taken it too far now.\\
We will just have to test it all out and see.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Empirical evidence for the win\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Always gotta test. I’m willing to put in the sacrifice. In the name of science of course.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Of course!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You're a science man after all\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I try to be.\\
Once you know you need to let me know what time today.\\I’m guessing it been full radio silence from the doctors?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I will let you know as soon as I know.\\
Has indeed been a radio silence. I'll give it half an hour and call them\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: So I've been signed off for two weeks but I need to go for an appointment at 5.55 tonight because they worried about some symptoms\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well that escalated quickly.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hasn't it just\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've never been signed off work\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: on the plus side you got an appointment.\\
Do you still want to do tonight?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes definitely\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Shall we say 6.30?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I've only been signed off once. Does make you feel ever so slightly less guilty when doctor says dont go to work\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: 6.30 works. I'm not going anywhere :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: that is a lot of worksheets :crying-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope you're not\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: its cold and dark at that time anyway :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's uni work going?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just finished what I was hoping to get done yesterday. About to post up a question about some of the maths to see if it makes sense. Amazing what we have been able to prove with maths and how stars had to have formed. Got to run out and get something for later, try for a quick lunch and then onto some python work\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: are you having a nap now you know the plans for the day?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh you've been productive! Well done!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I was woken up by the phone :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: that doesn't mean your not having another nap\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Exactly!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But I'm little bit better now I've spoken to them and have an appointment\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That's good.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I'd certainly like to learn more later. Specifically, I have a worry that I will accidentally physically hurt you which is then going to trigger an insecurity of mine. Something fun to unpick\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You're not going to physically hurt me, promise.\\
I just sometimes need quiet down time and am slower.\\But today, the GP, the big reaction from them, etc just has been a long time culmination of a few different things\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: that's good (about the not hurting thing)\\
Regardless of the thing it always seems to be that the thing needs to get a lot worse before something about it happens. The thing can be anything.\\Seems part of the human condition that we wait until breaking point\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup, and mine was Monday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I ordered something today\\
\url{https://www.ricife.co.uk/products/couple-card-interactive-game?variant=47655318847799}\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oooooh\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That will be a lot of deep conversations. You sure you're ready to hear all my deep dark secrets?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: ALL!\\
I guess we will find out.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Being that vulnerable is a big step for me! I'll do my best\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I'm the same BTW\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: As long as we get there\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: As long as we both are trying that’s all we can ask.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Exactly!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have you started the book?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Technically yes. Not that many pages though.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: First thought?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Seems pretty good. Did make me immediately wonder if someone’s style is influenced by their partner. Could your partners actions negatively affect your style.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think they can absolutely heighten your style. Anxious attached people often seek out avoidant people and that definitely plays their insecurities up\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know I used to do it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think like the love languages book the one line summary is going to be something like. “Don’t assume things and talk to each other” don’t be passive aggressive and don’t am use the other person with a difficult conversation. Make sure there is safe space to have discussions\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's a good one line summary.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've just spoken to work :grimacing-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Katie's coming over with a coffee\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not much work can do about it. Well, they have to deal with it.\\
That sounds like a good plan. Does Katie not work?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It makes me feel guilty, but I need to put myself first\\
Haha, she does. It's her lunch break\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: The lesson I learned later than I should. You absolutely have to take care of yourself first. Everything else is second. Everything\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I struggle with putting myself first at times. Have been a tiny bit better since diagnosis but still find it hard\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s easier in the mind to not take care of yourself over something else. But the long term negatives are not good.\\
You can see it happen in other people’s relationships fairly often.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Katie came just as I opened the text\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What do you mean about the in other people's relationships?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Different question- what school do you teach at?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Whyyyyy\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: My mum is interested as she lived in Uxbridge\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You told your mum about me?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yes. What school?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Douay\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What did you tell her\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Worried? Not a huge amount. That we have gone out, met at the running club, teacher\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I had assumed. Wasn't an issue\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Slightly :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I normally tell my parents if I have a date etc. Only high level info.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i would imagine i have said far less than you might have told people\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh really? You definitely have a very different relationship :relieved-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What do you think I've told people?? And who are these people? I told 3 we went for dinner....\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I've seen with people that they can quickly "give up" on themselves in a relationship. Easy to do when kids get involved. They stop doing hobbies or just taking care of themselves. Its why I think there is a high percentage of single people with a 2-4 year old kid.\\
Hannah (my PT) and her boyfriend are good example of a good way. They certainly prioritise there own health \/ fitness first then work out when they can spent time together.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: See, *3* people :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I told you my family are "weird"\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And you *only* told your mum?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: well, no. It might have come up to a few other people. Now that I think maybe 5 other people\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You see!!!!!!!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What have you been telling people? :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You seem worried.\\
Its all good stuff. Went on a date, date went well, i like her, we are doing more dates.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, I'm not don't worry :winking-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: As long as it's all the good stuff!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: A choice for you....\\
Would you like me to have dinner started or would you prefer to watch me panic from start to finish after you arrive?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oooh choices...\\
Maybe the chips can be started and I'll watch the rest of the panic?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: cool, i'll start cooking 1 minute before you arrive then :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well there's chips, steak and peppercorn sauce? I'm sure you can knock it out in no time :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: yeah its not super complicated as long as I actually get the pan hot enough. I only asked as i was thinking you might be very hungry by the time you get to mine.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: good luck at the doctors\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ran over by a bit. Leaving in 5\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No problem. See you when you get here\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: My car is taking absolute ages to defog :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :man-facepalming: ac need a recharge?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hasn't worked in 2 years :grimacing-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That certainly won’t help.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I knooow. I told you I needed to get a new car :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 3mins and I'm on the road\\
Sorry, I hate being late\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Doctors overrides it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okay. On the way\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just checking you got home ok\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm hooooome\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s good\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you again for dinner. It was lovely\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You’re very welcome.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We talked about a lot of big stuff!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And sorry I got sleepy so fast, I'm no good company past 9.30:face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: We did. I really appreciate that. I’m glad you were comfortable sharing\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: All would have been fine if we’d have started at 5, so no problem.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I feel like I talked much more than you :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: For a change. I’m normally the one that talks. It was good.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: We did mess up sorting out the next time we’ll see each other.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yes!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Maybe Sunday afternoon?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But also, shouldn't be a problem considering we talk all day!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes! That could work\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And maybe at the art show Saturday?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll have to see about the Saturday as I'm supposed to be seeing Patricia at some point\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Bring her, get her to spend money :grinning-face: but only if it genuinely works for your plans.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You should probably take advantage of the drugs making you sleepy.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, okay I'll see what she wants to do. But as I said, I don't want to overload myself whilst I'm signed off\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Definitely. Already getting changed for bed\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: So sleepy. Just hit me out of nowhere\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Get to sleep then :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Been a big week for you so far. Get the rest\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It has, hasn't it. I don't think I've processed it just yet\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sleep first\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sleep well. Night night\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good luck with the new roof\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, thanks\\
\section*{Thursday $23\textsuperscript{rd}$}
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Morning. Hope you slept well.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning. I have slept :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
How are you?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00000972-GIF-2023-11-23-07-58-12.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Virtual hug right back at ya\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well, I just woke up. I’m not sure I’ve ever met someone but I know they exist. These people who leap out of bed when their alarm goes off. Somehow full of energy. That would nice.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I leap out of bed but definitely not full of energy :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thank you again for last night. I’m really pleased you’re comfortable talking to me.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm comfortable talking about some things :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Small steps though.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Indeedy\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Uni work today?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep, hopefully it should be fun.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: When is your roof guy arriving?\\
Did you get everything cleared with school?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Should be here for 9 hopefully.\\
Well I sent that email yesterday and my HOD said I didn't need to call. Fingers crossed everything is sorted I guess\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s good. You weren’t sure last night if you needed to call or not. You can just focus on relaxing, and a new ceiling.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, it's very much going to be a sofa day today :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The wildlife is getting bolder in my garden. A full on pheasant is roaming around it.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha. Well you do live next to woods and national trust\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: well that is true but the wildlife did avoid it due to the dogs. They now seem to know. Not sure I've heard a pheasant make so much noise before.\\
Has roof man arrived?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ceiling man has arrived. Ceiling is down and he's measuring and cutting etc\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How’s the progress going on the repairs or should I just keep quiet?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I have a full ceiling! He's just doing the filler now.\\
How's uni work?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s fast.\\
Good but slow. Very interesting stuff though. I have no idea how any of the students who don’t know coding even have a chance with this work.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I have a ceiling and I've had a big nap.\\
He's coming tomorrow to paint everything.\\Glad uni work was good!\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s good news. Are you pleased with it?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well it's just plaster board at the moment but I don't have a massive hole so definitely a win\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What's your plan for tonight?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Definitely an improvement not having the hole. Silly it took so long to fix when it was basically done in a day.\\
I’ve got dinner with my friend Becky at 7. Currently trying to watch a very dull calculus video but the brain is a bit fried.\\I did have an idea :light-bulb:\\I could, swing past and say hello on my way to dinner…\\Just an idea. I may have been thinking about you a bit too much today.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah it took too long to get here for the amount of time the actual work took.\\
Why were you thinking about me?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I really appreciate the offer, really do but I might be popping out to see a friend in a bit.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have a really complicated answer. I like you.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was worth asking at least.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It is!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Basically, going back to your question. I can’t wait to see you again.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I really don't want to sound shitty but I do prefer not to do every day meetups at the beginning. Gives us both space and makes us look forward to seeing each other :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
In any case I will walk parkrun on Saturday and then we said maybe Sunday afternoon?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You are right. It is definitely the better way. Quality time is always going to be better.\\
I wont be at park run Saturday because of the art show but yes to Sunday.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ooooh, of course! I thought you had it on your space age calendar on the fridge :beaming-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
Yes, let's think about what to do on Sunday\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have a repeat meeting for parkrun which is why it was on the fridge :grinning-face:\\
Will have a think for Sunday, I might be mildly broken from the run but am hoping not.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yea, the 10k.\\
We can just go get some food if you want\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Food is always good. I have absolutely no idea where to suggest for a Sunday. I’m guessing you’re thinking more dinner \/ late afternoon.\\
I’ve got a fleeting hope of catching the F1  but think I’m going to miss a chunk of it by the time I get back.\\Your appointment is at 1pm?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What food do you fancy?\\
Oh what time is the run and the F1?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s a surprisingly hard question to answer.\\
The run starts at 10 and the F1 starts at 1pm. Somehow the run is a 90 minute drive away. Which I did  it check when I booked :man-facepalming:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, try?\\
Oh you'll make it back in time. Finished by 11.30, home for 1pm\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Some sort of hot food. Is that more helpful :grinning-face:\\
In theory yes. Run should be sub 80 minutes. Sub 70 would be better.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not helpful at all :face-with-tears-of-joy: have a think and let me know.\\
Enjoy your dinner tonight :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Will think.\\
You too.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just got home. Going to guess you might already be asleep.\\
\section*{Friday $24\textsuperscript{th}$}
Hope you had a nice evening.\\Night.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00001018-GIF-2023-11-24-07-02-15.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning!\\
Did you have a good evening?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah it was nice. We hadn’t caught up in a while and it’s nice to see her dog. Hear about some of the horrors of co-parenting!\\
How was yours?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah good.\\
Mine was nice, quiet and early night\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You didn’t go out in the end?\\
Any plans for today? How are you feeling? Less guilty \/ worried about work?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No, didn't fancy it in the end\\
Got the bathroom man here today so pottering around. And then going for dinner with a friend. How about you?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That will good to get the bathroom finished. Does include the other bits being painted?\\
Had my PT session this morning. Currently having a bit of a sit down from that. Got a call with a friend this morning. Got to pack up for the art show, it’s my niece’s birthday. So will be going over to my brothers house late afternoon. There is a call with my robot club this evening. Somewhere in that I need to do some uni work but I can already feel that bouncing into next week.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's a busy day for you! Hope it all goes well.\\
Yes it will be good to have it done. It's been a long time coming. I'm not sure if he's going to do the other bits today. Hopefully\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: If the other ceiling don't get painted I'm happy to help. I'm not terrible with a paintbrush.\\
Thinking about a plan for Sunday....\\I could pick you up, 4pm? Then 2 options given it would be a little early for food. Could be cheesy but bowling in town OR we could do a few games of pool. I was looking at the table top gaming place for some games but they would be shut.\\Then for food, as its a Sunday, was thinking either \url{https://www.boathouseboulterslock.co.uk/} or\\\url{https://www.thepolecatinn.co.uk/}\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you. But they do have to do it as a matter of principle. If I went through the insurance there would have been more stuff on the list so this is bare minimum.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I was thinking about Sunday too.\\
Could we maybe postpone it to sometime during the week?\\I desperately need some time for myself considering the last week.\\And cards on the table, I feel like we are doing too much too soon. I feel like things are moving a little too fast for me - this feeling might entirely be due to all the crap I have on my plate professionally and personally, but I'm still overwhelmed.\\I hope you understand\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I agree they should fix it and that’s the right thing to do. It’s not right but sometimes the quickest way is to just get it done.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Completely understand. Absolutely we can postpone. This has been moving fast and it’s unusual for me as well. I know you’re dealing with a lot of things we haven’t spoken about at all. So take the time.\\
I am here if you want to talk about things but no pressure.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you for understanding :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Of course. We already talked about how important it is to take care of yourself.\\
I’m finally back into some piece and quiet after the madness of my brother house. Children on their birthday are loud :face-with-tears-of-joy:.\\Hope you have a good evening with your friend.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you. It was lovely. Went to the Vietnamese in Marlow.\\
Hope you had a good evening\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think my friend had his 40th there. Glad you enjoyed it.\\
After birthday crazy, a very calm evening was had. Except rushing around sorting out stuff for the show and a very formal meeting on my robot club.\\I'll wish you good night.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sounds like a good evening.\\
\section*{Saturday $25\textsuperscript{th}$}
Night. Sleep well\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00001036-GIF-2023-11-25-07-15-47.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning. Thank you! Hope you do too and the craft fair goes well\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thanks, should be a fun day. Good day for parkrun much better than the swamp of last week.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It looks cold outside! Walking with Lynda and her sausage dog\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Can confirm. It is freezing!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hey, it looked like the dog was carried as much as it walked :grinning-face:. Craft fair was pretty good. Don’t think it was as busy as last year. Seems like a lot of fairs on this year. Weirdly the only things I sold were these puzzle boxes I only thought to print on Monday.\\
How’s your day been?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Heya. Haha, yes. Clyde definitely had the better deal with parkwalk.\\
Oh I'm glad it was good even if it wasn't as busy. I guess it's the cost of living crisis, people are definitely more cautious about monies.\\Ah nice, they looked cool.\\Day's been alright. Saw Patricia this afternoon for some food and catch up.\\What are you up to tonight?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sausage dogs do seem to love be carried.\\
People are certainly more careful with their money. Our show over the summer wasn't all that successful. Did seem like people we willing to buy small things but anything over £10 wasn't what people were looking for. Nice to see everyone though.\\Alright isn't bad so I'm going to say that's good. I know I don't know what your dealing with but do know I am thinking about you.\\Is Patricia from YPOM? I'm either thinking of the right person or completely wrong.\\I'm just about to go out with my friend Lester and meet up with some old work colleges for a curry. Poorly timed really as a nice chill evening would be much better after the show but these don't happen very often. Will be an early night though.\\You relaxing at home?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: He was a very good boy.\\
Yeah, ally secret Santas came down to like £10 limit too this year.\\Thank you. I'm little bit (a lot) all over the place at the moment and having to do a lot of thinking. I'm giving myself until Monday to wallow and the I'll make a plan.\\Yea Patri is ypom but not sure if you've met her. She's Spanish.\\Oh nice. Where are you going for the curry?\\Yes, just about to run my first bath with a ceiling. Smells lovely and painty :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s a good point about secret Santa. Something to remember for next year to maybe have a deliberate stand for it.\\
Sounds like a good plan, to make a plan. I find that half the battle along with just writing stuff down. If you can write it down your a lot of the way there.\\Ok, I’m not picturing the right person.\\At Chutneys. I always forget where it is! I still think Mr India is one of the best.\\Ha, paint has to be better than drafty! Enjoy.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've definitely noticed all my friends spending less this year. And I definitely need to do some no spend months too.\\
I just need to get my head right :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\Oh who were you picturing?\\Chutneys is good! Bombay palace is lovely too\\It is still bloody cold in here.  A towel radiator thing needs to go on my to do list for sure.\\Enjoy your dinner\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s certainly is a lot easier to spend money than not. What we really need is a better and more consistent way to get people to the event. That’s the really hard bit.\\
\section*{Sunday $26\textsuperscript{th}$}
You’ll get there. You got this.\\I’m very good at multi scenario planning. It was basically what my job was. So I’m great at different options with pros and cons for each. Just if you need a sounding board for anything.\\Had to look in the group and I thought it was Lynn Patrick. Clearly connected the wrong dots on the Pat part of the name.\\That’s weird the room is still cold. Something else for the house list then :man-facepalming:\\Food was good but super slow tonight. I’m back much later than I was hoping. Never mind.\\I’d guess you’re about ready for bed as well. Night.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00001048-GIF-2023-11-26-06-52-02.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning!\\
Did you have a good night?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good luck on your race today! You'll smash it!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It fun to see people again but would have should have been an earlier finish.\\
Thanks. Just parked up. It is cold! Should be fun though.\\Hope you have a good day. Any plans or are you just thinking?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You'll warm up soon enough. Hope it all goes well.\\
I'm going Xmas tree shopping with Katie this morning, then appointment, and some other girls just last minute made some plans for this afternoon so spending some time with them ( and then I will be completely wiped out because I don't know how to pace myself). I wasn't planning on doing anything this afternoon but I haven't seen them for a couple of months and need to girl time\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, 2km in and it will be roasting.\\
Always the way with a day.  Nothing to do or lots of options. Good to see your friends though. Enjoy.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: “Race” done. I really should have remembered gloves. Couldn’t feel my hands for the first 3km. Middle 5km was pretty nice and the last 2km was pain. Will see how broken I am tomorrow.\\
Did you find a tree? I assume you survived being lasered :grinning-face:\\Hope you have a good time with your friends.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah well done! Are you home and toasty now? How did you do?\\
I have survived being Lasered off, just heading home..\\What are you up to today? F1?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Home yes and still in the process of getting toasty.\\
I mean I finished it. Was slower than I thought 1:11:35. Last 2km  just hurt. Probably a little too cold really for a good time. I’ll blame last night curry and a lack of energy gels :grinning-face:\\Well done for surviving the lazer.\\Currently watching the F1, which is nearly done. Feel like a quick race.\\Probably some games with Matt at some point and I need to book some flights to go an see my friend next year. Might try and squeeze in a bath.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'd say a hot bath would definitely help with the defrosting.\\
That is a really good time! Well done. I'm thinking the curry definitely didn't contribute to peak performance :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\Oh where are you going next year?\\Oh I did get a tree. And some bits to go on it. Will see how grinchy I get this year :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I would have preferred not to have gone out last night but sometimes these thing clash. Will have to see how well I do at the London one as that is a much flatter course.\\
Going to be flying to Colorado for about a week. My friends wife is flying me out so that I can hang out with my friend. That’s the short version at least. They will be moving to Colorado at some point next year so I’m checking out the house with him and doing some nerd projects while he is wife and kid free. They currently live in Austin. Just need to make sure I can get uni sorted.\\Does the potato approve of the tree? I assume spud will knock it over.\\Maybe we can compete (compare maybe) on grinchiness. I’m not even sure where my tree is meant to go this year but will no doubt but some lights in the window. So I don’t look like a massive grinch to the street :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The London winter run?\\
Ah that's nice of your friend and his wife to fly you out.\\Well, we will see. I haven't put it up yet. Maybe if I'm not back too late tonight.\\Oh I don't want to compete on grinchness. You're supposed to have all the Xmas spirit and it then should rub off on me :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\Oh you'd better up your game for your posh street!\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s the one. Was really good this year. I think it’s the fastest 10km I’ve done. I’d love to do sub 60 but am guessing I’d need to nail a sub 30 parkrun first.\\
Yeah it’s super nice of them. They sort of don’t care about money. Long story. I have an interesting relationship with his wife. You can read her stellar thoughts on me when she comments on me being 40 on Facebook but she likes me now.\\If you can get a video of spud knocking it over… thats internet gold.\\Oh, ok. I’ll have to up my game a then. In fairness my grinch factor comes from literally no one else seeing the end result.\\Is it a posh street?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Real or fake tree?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm signed up to that one too but don't know if I'll be well enough (fit enough) to do it.\\
Oh well, I'm sure there's a story somewhere there.\\He will not be knocking it down! Might pick off a few baubles as every year but hopefully it will remain standing.\\Yes please!\\And definitely a posh street\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Finally fake. Katie said I can store it at hers so could finally get one that will last\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Plenty of time to find out RE the run. Could always walk it?\\
I think she started by describing me or likening me to a fungus…\\Make of that what you will :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\Ok, I’ll do Christmas. There will NOT be a tree before my birthday though.\\What makes it posh? I know it’s expensive.\\Fake tree is definitely the right choice. I have no idea how old mine is now and still works great. Oh, you don’t have a loft. Being in the middle.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I'll see how I am closer to the time.\\
Well that's a stellar recommendation :eyes:\\Haha, I assumed that. I might put mine up just to cheer me up.\\The expensive part makes it posh. And it's nice and quiet\\I don't think anyone has a loft in my building to be honest. And I also don't really have much storage space except the airing cupboard which is already bursting at the seams.\\Just waiting to be picked up by the girls\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s a good recommendation for sure :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
It is quite. I’ll give you that. When I first moved in I was annoyed at all the bird noises. Took me a while to work it was the lack of other noise that meant I could hear them :man-facepalming:\\I was lucky in my flat. It had a loft. As you have seen, I have a lot of stuff and honestly at least half of it is probably not needed. Loft is useful for that once a year type stuff but quickly becomes a dumping ground for things. It easier to throw in the loft than throw away. You could get a bed with all the storage under and when you get  new sofa, one with storage.\\Enjoy girl time.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you.\\
Have a good afternoon\/evening\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How has your evening been?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Pretty quiet. Some games which were once again very slow. Definitely some buyer remorse but I think it will get better or we need to get better.\\
Sorted my flights, less painful than I remember. Although I will need a new passport next year :man-facepalming:. Then just TV and dinner.\\How was yours? Has spud attacked the tree yet :grinning-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sounds like a good Sunday night tbh. So when are you off to Colorado?\\
My afternoon was lovely. We went to the Windsor illuminations.\\I got home too late to start on the tree so that's a job for tomorrow\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m flying out on the 11th Jan and then fly back on the 21st. I think it will be very cold and I’ve never been to Colorado. So will be interesting. I think it’s a fairly new plane as well. I just don’t do that well with jet lag on the way home.\\
Oh I saw that advertised on instagram. Was it good? I’ve done the Q garden one before. Looked like parking was a pain.\\Saves the tree from being attacked for a while :grinning-face: if you leave the box out will he play with that instead?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh nice 10 days away. Oh it will be absolutely freezing, you'd better stock up on some thermals.\\
It was brilliant. So well done. Yeah I've done Kew gardens before and loved it.\\Hmm, he's not much of a box cat so I guess we'll see\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I really need to plan out the uni work as I’ll probably need to do some out there, he will still be working a bit as well. I’ll have to dig them out from somewhere in the wardrobe. He’s not the most outdoors person so I don’t think I need to worry about us hiking in the snow.\\
Glad it was good. When I first saw the advert I did think it could be a good date but I did gawk at the ticket price a bit.\\The internet has lied to be again. I thought all cats were obsessed with an empty box. That’s disappointing.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah the tickets weren't the cheapest that's for sure. But to be honest Marlow wasn't that much cheaper last year and much smaller.\\
I'm going to head to bed.\\Sleep well. Night\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Didn’t know Marlow did one. Cannot even guess where they would have done that.\\
\section*{Monday $27\textsuperscript{th}$}
Good plan. I’ll be doing the same soon enough.\\Night.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00001076-GIF-2023-11-27-08-07-49.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning!\\
Yes, I'm seeing Steph a bit later, I think Katie is coming over lunch too and then I need to sort the flat out.\\How about you?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ve got my session with Hannah at 5. Currently going round and round trying to work out what order to do things in. I’ve got an assignment due Thursday. Will be doing some batch cooking today which I think I’ll do next then its really working out if I start the assignment or do I focus today on some background learning which would probably help the assignment. Somehow in my head I’ve already run out of days this week. Which is ridiculous.\\
On the plus side I might be the least broken from the 10k compared to others. So that’s something.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well that's a bit to get done today!\\
How big is the assignment?\\And what are you batch cooking?\\Oh that's really good that you're not feeling too bad after yesterday. Well done\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just a bit yeah :grinning-face: I don’t have to finish the assignment today but it’s only for 1 module got the other 2 modules work to do this week as well.\\
It’s 6 questions. A couple of them I know I can answer the others. Not so much. Probably a full days work to write it all out. It’s only worth 2\% so I won’t be killing myself to make it perfect as it won’t make a difference in the long term.\\This week I’ll be doing my Chinese beef stew thingy. Which I think is brilliant. I’m still not brilliant with the pressure cooker so I might cook it the old way or just oven for 3 hours. In theory it should cover me for the next 2 weeks with everything else that is going on. Will see.\\Do you know what Steph will have you doing? Hopefully it won’t be what she posted yesterday! Some of her cardio classes are just insane\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Probably easiest to just get it knocked out if you have another 2 to do.\\
Ah that sounds nice! 2 weeks?? I can't really do leftovers\/ batch food. Something there doesn't let me eat it.\\What's going on in the next two weeks?\\I'm not sure what we're doing today but it's definitely not cardio\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Getting it done would be the easiest approach.\\
Interesting. Do you not like the idea of the same dinner for X days in a row?\\I’ll make at least 5 dinners maybe 6. Generally one evening in the week will be out or different food. I’m trying to use up stuff in my freezer. So not more cooking is a bit of a stretch but heating stuff up on the oven or grill doesn’t count in my mind as cooking. Got a pizza to make and burgers to use. Then next week Thursday to Saturday is all counted for for my birthday and the YPOM pizza thing.\\Lifting heavy things is definitely “easier” good luck with it.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hmm, not necessarily. I don't mind eating the same thing but it has to be cooked fresh. I don't mind like 2 days in a row.\\
Oh yea, birthday week celebrations :beaming-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\Hope sesh with Hannah was good\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I get what you mean. I used to do that but was spending ages cooking. I like cooking but for one person is a bit of a drag and I find it very hard to cook most things for just one person.\\
I found a guy on you tube that does batch cooking and that got me started. Not poisoned myself yet :grinning-face:\\Not really thinking about birthday yet. Got 2 assignments first :face-with-tears-of-joy:. Had the thought that Im probably now in the US for yours.\\Session was good. Cold. Had a bit of an issue, she blames baby brain. We doubled the weight on a machine. Made it work, so a good thing. Now I just cannot feel my arms.\\How your day been \/ how are you doing?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I usually have small dinners anyway so I guess it's easier for me.\\
Actually you will be back by the time mine rolls around.\\Ah glad you had a good session and well done on the big weights.\\I'm actually having quite a bad day. Little bit of a back to square one thing. But tomorrow is a new day\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, I’m sorry you’re having a bad day. Your right, tomorrow is a new day and sometime you just have to wait until the next day for things to be better.\\
I know you’ve got friends to talk to but I’m here if you want to talk about stuff or if you want to talk about rubbish.\\Good to know I’m back in time. I bet that will be the time for my procedure.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What procedure?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you.\\
It's all a bit of a weird time in my life so not sure what I'm doing with it all. I think I need to process stuff. Somehow.\\I don't even know :woman-shrugging-light-skin-tone:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: My vasectomy.\\
As much as you have to try and think about things it’s normally when you explain and issue to someone else that the solution presents itself or becomes clearer.\\Totally not the same but it’s a well known debugging technique to talk about an issue and the very act of describing the problem gives you the solution.\\You can google talk to the duck.\\Do you still talk to a counsellor?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aaah.\\
I have spoken to people. But there are just some things I have to deal with myself. Got to put my big girl pants on.\\How's your evening been?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Obviously I still don’t know everything but have you got to make some choices or come to terms with things? Only asking as if it’s the making choices option. Making the choice is and can be really hard but there is also a huge amount of relief from just making it. As it defines a path to follow.\\
Really not much this evening. Literally dinner and then some games with my friend Matt. We really went to sure on this game. Great for wasting time but not really what I was looking. Did have a quick panic that I missed a tutorial but he guy in the group was wrong. Phew.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Definitely need to make some choices and then do something about the choice\\
Oh did you not have a tutorial tonight?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is the annoying things with decisions. The action plan after. That’s were advice from a complete stranger (not meaning me) can be very insightful. As they have no hidden agenda.\\
Not the same but I think I maybe had one friend who was behind my decision to go back to uni. Pretty much everyone thought it was stupid or just didn’t understand. So I did learn from that that you have to make the choices you want to make and not the ones you think others want you to make. They don’t have to live with the choice. Only you do.\\Nope and none this week. Soo nice as the last month has been 2 or 3 a week and they have been breaking my brain.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that's nice! At least you can focus on your assignments.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Will head to bed now. I've screwed up my sleeping patter already.\\
Night. Sleep well\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night. Tomorrow will be a better day\\

\section*{Tuesday $28\textsuperscript{th}$}
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Morning. Hopefully you’re still asleep.\\
Really hope today is a better day.\\How have you screwed up your sleep pattern? It’s very natural for it’s to shift a bit given you currently don’t have to be up at 5. Happens to everyone.\\Be kind to yourself. Thinking of you.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hiya.\\
Sorry I didn't reply earlier. Sort of a head clearing day. I had a lie in, then went for a massive 9.5k walk around spade oak\/Marlow. Then a food shop. Now home and starving so getting some food together.\\How's your day been so far?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hey, No need to apologies. I'd guessed you were focusing on yourself today and a well deserved lie in.\\
Well done on the walk. I was going to ask if you made it outside today as it might be the best day for a while. I'm guessing you nearly did the spade oak YPOM route? I did not like running it but it is a great walk and a walk is great for helping clear the mind.\\Erm, 3:30 is way too late for lunch....\\Days been ok so far. Pretty good spin class this morning. Actually had a good vibe (urgh) in the room, with other people chipping in. Our instructor is quite odd. Been working through my assignment which is due on Thursday. I have done all the question I at least think I know the answer to and think i'll just leave the rest as is before it affects the other modules I am on. Though I could work one of them out but I'm missing something.\\Does mean I am now knackered.\\Has the walk helped at all? You up to anything the rest of the day?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We went from spade oak, grabbed a coffee in Marlow and walked back. It was good but I am knackered .\\
I guess it was a late lunch\/early dinner.\\Well done on getting started on the assignment. Will you manage to finish it for Thursday?\\It was definitely good to be out.\\Michelle is popping round to pick up some of the soup I made yesterday after the Tuesday run. And then I'm going to take a bath because I huuuurt after yesterday\\How about you?\\Btw, I swapped my hairdresser to tomorrow\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Were you walking it with Katie? She would be my one and only guess :grinning-face:\\
Not surprised about being knackered, it is a long way.\\I can get pretty cranky if I miss lunch then it messes up my dinner. You could count this as a hobbit first dinner.\\Will be done by Thursday. No choice really. I will be leaving some questions blank but hopefully they will give me the answers as part of the marking. Maybe that will the "OH YEAH" moment I need.\\I had all good intensions of joining the run today but I have 2 excuses, maybe 3. It is COLD and DARK, I cannot find my torch and my legs still hurt.\\Is that huuuurt from Steph? Is your bathroom any better now or is it still unreasonably cold?\\Super wild evening planned. Maybe play some games after dinner OR watch tv. I might think about debugging my robot but the brain is mush.\\Hairdresser? when was it meant to be? I'm missing something. I thought you got lasered on Sunday\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No, I went with Becky and the pooches.\\
Oh have they not covered all the questions in the study materials or is it like calculations you have to work out yourself?\\Oh but they are doing Christmas lights tonight!\\I have a torch you can borrow.\\Yeah it's from Steph. Did some heavy deadlifts and upper body.\\Yeah bathroom is still cold. Or maybe not, but I do have trouble regulating my temperature so not really sure :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\That is a rock'n'roll evening, almost as good as mine.\\I didn't get my hair Lasered off!!\\Hairdresser was supposed to be next Thursday\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: They have covered the questions I just don’t get it and because it’s an assignment you can’t really get any help. I’m hoping it will all click at some point later.\\
Are they doing lights? I missed that. I know the Christmas light run 16km thing is on Sunday.\\I’m cooking dinner now anyway (another excuse)\\What are you up to on deadlifts? I’ve got them on Friday.\\Ha, at least the bath itself will be hot.\\I do try an make all my evenings rock and roll :grinning-face:\\Ahh right. That does make lot more sense :face-with-tears-of-joy:. So, when can I see the results?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They are doing Wycombe lights. Mark's Saturday (?) run is the London lights.\\
What are you cooking?\\I've topped 60 for 3 sets. What about you?\\I mean, what it meant to say is that I am no longer unavailable on the 7th...\\What are you up to on Friday?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I completely missed the Wycombe lights in the group. I only saw Linda doing the 10k and then Rebecca and Nicky were doing her couch to 5km. Still not sure it would have made be go.\\
In the quest to use up the freezer I cooked some burgers. Trying to get back to a more stable (sensible) food intake.\\Oh well done. That got to be body weight deadlifts then!\\Mine might be stupid on Friday. I might be trying for 210 for one. Which would be beyond amazing and it would mean I beat Lloyd (Steph’s friend) who is a machine.\\I see. That’s good. I’m definitely free in the evening but doing something with my brother for lunch and because my brother is involved it is too far in the future to know more than that :face-with-tears-of-joy:.\\At the moment, just like all week, I am currently doing nothing on Friday. He says being deliberately obtuse.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Being less obtuse. Would be great to do something Friday.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I had a burger too.\\
210kg????\\Yeah, it'd be nice to do something on Friday. Anything you fancy?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah 210kg. Last time was 3x5@180kg  so 210 might be possible.\\
Besides yourself obviously :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:Assuming evening? Heidrun is my go to place in town but that’s not very good when you’re not drinking. Too dark and cold for anything outside otherwise I’d suggest some sort of walk. For an activity we could give bowling a try or pool. Open to suggestions on food. Could always go further afield. Marlow or cookham\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh jeezus. That's a lot.\\
Doesn't need to be evening.. I have an appointment at 2 but free after. I haven't actually been out to eat in cookham so wouldn't know what to suggest. Bowling could be fun\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: What time would you be free on Friday then? We could start with bowling and fill in the rest later. We have a few days.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I could be free for 4? Does that work?\\
Yeah, that's a good plan :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: 4 works. I’ll have finished uni work by then. Can pick you up?\\
Friday will be a good day. They should also be releasing the PhD’s for next year.\\Oh, I finally got to speak to a doctor about my scan results. Everything’s fine. Which is great, just took 2 months from start to finish.\\Have you made it to the bath yet?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you. That will be lovely.\\
Ooh, are you applying for next year?\\That's really good. Glad it came out as nothing. Would be weird if we were both broken :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\Michelle hasn't been yet so no. Just pottering around and listening to some weird and wonderful 80s-90s Slovak music :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s the plan. No pressure at all. Will have only spent the last 2 years trying to get accepted plus life long dream :face-with-tears-of-joy:. Hoping they have one I like the sound of.\\
Yeah don’t need both of us broken :grinning-face:. Dr did say I need to drop some weight but that not new and I want to anyway.\\Wow, they must be running for a while then. I have absolutely no idea what that might sound like.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well hopefully they will. You can tell me about it on Friday.\\
I think I'm broken enough for both of us.\\Well, did the Dr mention eating your 5 a day? :beaming-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\Haha, it's weird, but comforting for me I guess\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: The Dr may have mentioned numerous times over the years…. BUT my blood work is fine. So, something something.\\
I cannot judge on music my taste is quite eclectic.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :eyes::eyes::eyes:\\
Oh go one, tell me more about this eclectic music taste\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well my friends will tell you I have shit taste in music but you’ve heard some of it already.\\
Mainly EDM but I don’t really follow bands or artists. If I like something I like it.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I mean I listen to all sorts so not one to judge\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Finally bath time. My hamstrings and lower back are killing me\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Enjoy, my hamstrings are always an issue.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh it's all done now!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Snuggled in bed already\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Back to the routine then. I’ll be there shortly.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not sleeping yet!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just realised how you could have read that last message :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I did read it that way :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good to know.\\
It’s a bit late for that. Well not really but I’m tired today.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Mmmm, the romance :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Exactly :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00001138-GIF-2023-11-28-21-59-37.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Very smooth\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thank you. I’m either smooth by mistake or awkward.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I bet you're manifesting awkwardness by saying you're awkward :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No doubt. I’ll have to try manifesting being smooth then.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: There you go!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Fake it till you make it and all that :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep. That is 90\% of what being a consultant was.\\
“Yeah sure” with no idea how.\\Let’s not be faking things though….\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Let's not!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good, I can work with that.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You in bed yet?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That looks like a very long hat? Did you have to braid the wool first?\\
I really think it’s a cool hobby. Creative and easy to move around. Barley any equipment\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I mean... My house is filled with yarn :woman-shrugging-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s really cool. Is each row \/ block different wool or the one ball is just multi coloured?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Very fancy. How many more hats are on the list?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Million!! I'm really behind (probably because I've also tried making mittens and gave one to my Irish friend)\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I don’t know why but mittens sounds a lot harder than they should be.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Probably because they are fingerless :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What about socks and scarves?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I have not thought about socks yet. Scarf would be easy peasy\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I saw a video of someone trying to make a sock making crochet machine. It did not look easy.\\
You could do full hat, scarf and mittens. Just to make it harder :grinning-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, I could. But not this time round. Already have way too many to make\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You might have to measure your head if I have time :winking-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Can measure on Friday if we remember. Big head.\\
I could try and help but that might slow down the whole process\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha. Do you know how to crochet?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: In theory but I haven’t done it for a very long time.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ooooh. How come?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How come i known or not done it?\\
My Nan taught me as a kid and there might be a half finished blanket somewhere.\\Not don’t it recently due to no equipment and wasn’t high enough on the list of hobbies to do.\\I almost did it when I was in hotels all the time but never happened\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that's really cool :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well, we already knew I was cool :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Right, I'll have to finish the hat tomorrow. Bedtime I think\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night. Sleep well\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night. You too.\\

\section*{Wednesday $29\textsuperscript{th}$}
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good Morning. Hope today is a better day for you as well.\\
What’s the grand plan? Haircut and then full sweat shop hat making?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning.\\
Really didn't sleep well, kept waking up from the hams pain. Don't know why I'm having such bad DOMS.\\not sure yet, definitely the haircut, very possibly the hats, maybe seeing Katie at some point too.\\What are you up to today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Wow that's sucks. That is really bad DOMS if it kept you up. Another wild day of uni work. Should be interesting today. How protostars (just hot gas) actually turn into stars. I am having lunch with my dad, we are trying some new place he has seen in town. So can report back if it is any good or not.\\
Then will try and do something not uni but productive this evening.\\Sounds like a good chill day for you at least.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh where are you going for lunch?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just had to look it up :grinning-face:\\
Osaka's Which I'm hoping is a slightly posh yo sushi\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh it's the new Japanese place! Definitely let me know how it is, wanted to go there\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Certainly will. Could be an option for Friday if its any good. Protein and Rice is kind of my perfect food\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well Osaka's is really nice. Can recommend.\\
Hope hair cutting and socialising is going well.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I haven't left yet :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ooooh definitely need to go now!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did you have a nice time with dad?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: does that means its going well or just that women's hair takes forever?\\
We can go on Friday if you like?\\Really nice, I'd forgotten how long it had been since we'd just been out the 2 of us. Normally my mum would dominate the conversation.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No no, I mean I am still at home :face-with-tears-of-joy: app is in an hour\\
Oh yes, I'd like that.\\Oh I'm glad you had a nice time.\\What's the plan for the rest of the day?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh, a chilled day indeed then. Did you see Katie?\\
Well that's Friday sorted then :grinning-face:\\Going to be uni until my brain gives up, dinner and then something. Not sure what that is yet.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Katie is after hair, she's working.\\
Just got to the hairdresser. It's on a farm and I'm looking over sheep and horses and cows :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Is it a farm in Chalfont St Giles by any chance?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hmm. Little missenden I think\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Why?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: only that it would have been funny. The farm where we rent a barn for the summer art show has a cabin where someone does hair. Just would have been funny if that's where you went\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: She's in like an old gypsy caravan\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Finally home. How's your evening been?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: From just the haircut or did you see Katie as well?\\
Evening has been slow. Little bit of self sabotage may have happened this afternoon. Just been watching tv and wondering if I should try and get an early night for once or at least get off the sofa and do something\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Noo, I did go see Katie and her kid.\\
Aaah, the procrastination station. Know it all too well. Did you manage to get off the sofa?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s good, otherwise that’s a super long hair cut. Did you get dinner or did that get delayed?\\
Erm, still on the sofa. About to move.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I got dinner. Haven't had anything since breakfast.\\
Haha, what are you going to do?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: ouch, no lunch!!!\\
I am going super rock and roll crazy. Got some uni emails to get through. Cann't get the brain to focus. Given that i'm up early for spin early bed would be a good idea\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, early bed is a good idea.\\
I'm really struggling with focus at the moment.\\But tomorrow - pamper morning, lunch coffee with Jenny and then down to work. And got a webinar in the evening. Fingers crossed I do all of that\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: is spud taking notes :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
I find focus can be all over the place. Sometimes its easy. Somedays it is just gone. All went wrong for me this morning when some sales or religious people knocked on my door trying to peddle something. Completely ruined my thought process. Sometimes you just have to try again tomorrow.\\I'm guessing I know Jenny from YPOM?\\Back to work?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Back to work?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: you said your going down to work?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no. Job stuff. Want to apply for a couple more and have a look what else is out there\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Do you not have a video doorbell? I never open the door unless I'm expecting someone :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yes, you definitely know Jenny, she goes to parkrun\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh that makes more sense. That's exciting, not the applying part as that is a pain but new stuff is exciting. Will ask more on Friday.\\
I have a camera out the front but by the time I check it on the app I might of well waited for a print out to be delivered to me via post. I thought it was my Dad being super early. I have now ordered a polite version of a "fuck off" sticker.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: As if they are going to respect it :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: very true. It would require them to read. At least then I can point to the sign and then the camera.\\
I am thinking of the right Jenny then.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm sure they are more than capable of reading :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
I'm sure you are!\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: If I have learned anything it is that people do not read. I have even caught myself doing it wrong.\\
We would sometimes spend literal weeks pouring over text that end users would see. Then on day 1 people would immediately ask questions that are answered IN THE TEXT. Not bitter about it :grinning-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: What is you webinar about tomorrow?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You don't sound it at all\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: About leaving teaching...\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I was trying to think what that would be\\
"Letting logic win again" Nope because work  without children still dont like logic.\\"Only dealing with smart adults" Nope again\\"Less paperwork" - maybe\\"Less holiday" - absolutely\\Maybe a talk on what an airport is actually like, it isn't like a zoo all the time.\\Or a glimpse into the ability to carry out day time tasks that aren't work related. Like a dentist appointment or taking a car for an MOT\\You'll have to tell me about it on friday\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: More like how to go about it. As you know teaching consumes your whole identity and it's very hard to see the wood for the trees. I know I am well qualified and experienced and have shed load of transferable skills bit it's still hard even contemplating the option\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That does actually make sense. Teaching is so different from 90\% of all other jobs our there but so much is transferable. All problem solving, communication and time management transfer straight across and is easier in the traditional office environment. The teacher job application process is also completely different. That always surprised me. I actually prefer the teacher approach of it all being done in a day rather than the strung out approach everyone else does\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah it's all a bit of a head fuck, excuse the language\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: outrageous language :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
I can only imagine. It has certainly hurt going back as a student and that isn't even close to be the same. I think the biggest differences to overcome are the super strict and rigid rules and timelines. Almost no flexibility at all, so your always finding a way to make it work within a very ridged structure. Most jobs aren't like that. There is give and take\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well... I do know, I was a corporate -ish girlie for 10 years. But teaching changes your brain chemistry. And the worst thing is that I'm not making this decision because I hate it or work in a shit school. I love it, and I'm bloody good at it, but my health is being destroyed and I've gotten so much worse over the last 18 months\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: A great job that is slowly destroying you isn't very good in the medium to long term. While scary and annoying it is a chance to be good at something and hopefully find something else you enjoy. Opens up a whole scary list of possibilities\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Wish it was easier to just pick up the next direction :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: tell me about it. It is terrifying. Being comfortable is very nice but can also be very dangerous.\\
There is something like "The life worth living is just on the other side of work you dont want to do"\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: If I was in a position to completely retrain I'd do it but unfortunately, bills to pay, furry child to feed\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The bills do get in the way.\\
Well done. That pattern is awesome\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: totally off topic. Might you be free Thursday 14th. Have seen something we could do.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I might. What is it?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: secret :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh noooo. I am not good with secrets\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: keeping them or suprises?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: \url{https://trafalgartickets.com/wycombe-swan-theatre/en-GB/event/other/christmas-hellfire-comedy-club-14-dec-tickets}\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that's a late one !\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Would have been wanting to go to one of these but if I'm back at work it might be tricky\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sorry\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: yeah it can be late. Probably would be home for 11. Which is still late.\\
Can just see. No problem if we cannot do it.\\The 2 times I've been the comedy hasn't been amazing but it is cheap\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Let's keep it on the list :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep.\\
Right, i'm off to sleep. So will wish you a good night.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sleep well. Night\\
\section*{Thursday $30\textsuperscript{th}$}
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Morning :sleeping-face:\\
Hope you slept better.\\What’s the pampering you’ve got this morning?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning!\\
Yes, I did. Still hurting loads though. How about you?\\I'm going to get a pedicure, I think.\\How was spin class?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Wow that is a long set of DOMS. Slept ok just not long enough although when I slept for a long time Wednesday I still felt the same.\\
Spin class was ok. 30min class is just shit and OMG was I cold. Car needed defrosting and I do not go to a spin class dressed for the cold.\\We were going to hit the gym after but went for a coffee instead with my friend Toria.\\You think?\\I’m not sure how but I feel I need to up my game somehow. I have a feeling you’re going to look even more stunning than normal for our date.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah, fibro makes DOMS that extra special.\\
I've looked outside and it looks so coooold. Will have to scrape my car for sure.\\Haha. Thanks but we are going bowling so it's definitely not going to be black tie :face-with-tears-of-joy: Mani\/pedi is definitely one of those little things I like to do to treat myself\\Speaking of I still need to try on those dresses for Laura's fight\\What's your plan for today?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I didn't get an interview for the cyber security role :pensive-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Booo, onto the next. A bit like dating. Get the no fast and move on. At least you found out real quick. Any feedback as to why? They do have to provide it if you ask.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not on the first stage of application. But the score was 3 for the personal statement - moderate evidence. Gutted\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I wasn’t expecting black tie :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
I volunteer to “help” with dresses. Always good to get a second opinion :winking-face:\\Gotta treat yourself.\\Today, want to finish my chapter on stars and then start my quantum chapter. Got to submit my assignment first.\\So the first half of the day should be good and then pain when I read the quantum stuff.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: 3 out of? Not sure how the application process works. That is a real shame. I thought it was evidenced well.\\
Need to slap them in the face with it.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Out of 7. Yeah I was really keen on it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, I'm sure you volunteer :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Busy day for you! Hope the finishing touches on the assignment go well\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Who the fuck scores things out of 7! Would love to see a level 7 statement.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Civil service. That's their way. I'm quite good with their process at this point\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m a giver at heart. Sacrifices have to made every now and then :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Why is the nail shop so busy on a Thursday morning??\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, that's because you went. Otherwise it would be quiet.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Obviously! Why are these people not at work :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: that is the question. They are everywhere. At lunch yesterday I joked with my dad. All these people need a job to make it quiet for me\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aren't you doing your food shop after 5pm\/on a weekend??\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: no but also yes. I get it delivered on a Monday morning but I do go to the shop on a Saturday after parkrun and I have found myself out and about at lunch which is also a mistake\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So, I may have got distracted. Is this genius or truly evil\\
\url{https://cults3d.com/en/3d-model/art/really-annoying-card-container}\\Am going to get this printed out so I can give it to my nephew (8) for Christmas. Should keep him quiet for a little while\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have you submitted your assignment? :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: no, I am about to.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's so very easy to get distracted\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Submitted.\\
Very easy. especially when what I really should be doing is hard and I'm not immediately good at it.\\So, too evil or just evil enough to be funny for everyone else?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just evil enough. But he might cry\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is 100\% going to happen anyway. I might as well be the reason for it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The real evil is weather I put something in it :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You must put something really cool in it!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: hmmm, that will be a challenge\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'd throw it at you if it were empty :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Why? What does he like? His parents must have a Santa list\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Noted. They guy has made one that is worse. with 2 more layers of boxes. But I still have to build the thing\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: There is a list. It hasn't filtered to me yet. They will get loads of stuff so really i'll try and find an annoying way of giving them money. Unless something on his list will fit\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I always buy books for kids. Force my love of reading on them\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Actually I buy books for everyone\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Books is always good. I did see this great idea that you'd pay kids £x for each book the read as a way to trick them. Fortunately both of them are better at reading than my brother and I were.\\
I also saw a guy talk about how reading was the currency of his house. If the kids want something it they would have to read x books or pages to get it.\\I read a lot during the day but not so good on actual books\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I love the Icelandic Christmas tradition. On Christmas Eve, everyone unwraps a book gift and then they spend the evening\/night snuggled with hot drinks and snacks reading their books\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I like that idea. TBH I'd promote any idea that involves some level of chill or calm.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I literally just want to hibernate in a cottage somewhere, with fire, books and yarn\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: that's actually quite a good body doubling hobby. Sat reading\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: rocking chair and cat I assume\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't get this...\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Absolutely\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sorry, body doubling is term I recently learned that ADHD people relate to. It's when the presence of someone else helps you focus on a task your trying to complete. So you dont need to interact with the other person, they are just there doing their thing while you do yours.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So, instead of both sat watching the TV. Both reading\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yea! Haven't heard referred to it like that but I know what it is\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I saw it somewhere and it was a full light bulb moment when I realised it really helps me. Good and annoying\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sometimes it helps me and sometimes it just needs to be me and podcasts\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They are just starting my trotters! I've been here for an hour :loudly-crying-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: will the wait be longer than it takes?\\
You are meant to be relaxing, so has it helped at all\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah the wait is no longer than how long it'll take.\\
I didn't have breakfast so very hungry now :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Whoops, rookie mistake.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I take it your going to Laura's thing on Sunday? FB has gone mad telling me about it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well... I'm actually in London all day with a friend I used to live with, it's our annual thing. I'm hoping I'll be back on time for Laura's thing. Do you want to go?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: isn't there a train strike on Sunday? Its messed up my plans a bit to go to Oxford, so i'm going to have to suffer the park and ride BUS!\\
I was thinking about it now that I've actually read what it is.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh lord I didn't realise, shit.\\
What are you doing in Oxford?\\We could go if I make it back on time.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, the trains are all sorts of broken.\\
Planning on going to this \url{https://www.sanjaymortimerfoundation.org/smrrf23}\\It's pretty cheap as long as I dont buy anything there. Not done a 3D printing show before.\\Yeah we can go (that was my thought).\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh cool.\\
Now I don't know what to do about my friend. Crap crap crap\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: where were you planning on meeting them as its only the chiltern line that is closed on Sunday. Could drive to one of the Ruislip's and get the tube? I did that for the winter run\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Kings cross.\\
I am terrified one of the school kids will see me as they all live around ruislip\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: you could go from Amersham but that train takes forever\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah it does, and it's Sunday\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Maybe I should just go to Burnham and take Elizabeth\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: that never helps. Could just drive in?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Definitely not :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Two trains an hour is the same as Sunday Oxford service\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Probably my best shot isn't it?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: probably. Less driving than Ruislip and probably the same about of train time\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okay\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also, how are you getting anything done chatting to me?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: erm, I'm not\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No more procrastination station!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: ok, i'll do some work.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Finally home to some food. Ended up getting a manicure too :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, when in Rome as they say. I thought you were getting lunch with Jenny?\\
Finished my Stars chapter so now I can get some lunch and then suffer quantum mechanics\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Jenny had to go into office today :confused-face:\\
Woohoo on a chapter finish\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: urgh, work really does ruin everything.\\
Yeah, this topic is super interesting and has math I can do. Still not sure how someone worked out the equation that tells you how big a star can be but it is cool to see\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Huel hot lunch. I’m not sure what it tastes like but it isn’t Mac and cheese\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh nooo. Was it not good?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: it\\
was\\not\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: This is what made me not get it....\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Maybe tweak the preparation?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i guess you have to try these things. Maybe it can be improved. More pepper and salt for a start\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What was it like? Why didn't you like it?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: it had an unexpected crunch and I'm really not sure what the flavour is. Not really bad just not good. Its nice that you actually eat something but the drink tastes better. I might try the carbonara tomorrow to see if that is any better\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh it's so disappointing when something just doesn't taste right. Hopefully the other one will be better\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Let's hope so. The batchers mac and cheese is certainly better just missing the protein and other good ness. At least its only 7 portions and not more.\\
Are you job searching this afternoon?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I had a little lie down but couldn't doze off, will hoover and then sit down to have a look\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's the quantum mechanics chapter going?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: erm, not brilliant. Each of the words on their own are in English but the full sentences aren't making the most sense. I really am starting think I might have tried to do too much and the knock on implications are not brilliant.\\
So I might have spiralled a very small amount.\\I'll just burn through this chapter as it is at least short but there are fundamentals i am not understanding. I could understand them or at least i think i could understand them if this was all i was doing BUT I can just about do my others 2 modules really well if this one isn't a big time sink.\\SO, no pressure at all. I really need to see the list of PhD's tomorrow and then quickly work out\\A - do i like any of them. Hope so or that is a problem\\B - do i have a chance of getting it with what i know now and does that mean i can drop this to focus on the other stuff\\B+ - If i drop this could i add in a math module for February that could bolster my application\\C - Its all fucked and i need a plan B which at this point might actually be plan J\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What do you mean about the knock on implications?\\
Is there anywhere else you could learn about the fundamentals? Honestly YouTube videos are good for so much\\Hoping the list tomorrow will have at least one or two good courses for you\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You Tube is the best. I have a very eclectic subscriber list. It is the platform i watch the most. There is some good stuff on there. It all comes down to timing.\\
What I probably need to do is back off the Quantum stuff and use that time for the maths I am missing. I'm just not sure i could then catch up.\\The implications that I potentially have that you will be able to understand more than most is essentially the speed of academia. It cannot be slowed down or speed up. It runs at its pace and if you dont keep up you have to wait a year, at best. Until you can try again.\\So the problem is. If I don't get onto a PhD next year (Oct 24) then that means 2 things. Give up and do something else or at least one more year of study before starting the PhD.\\If the second one is true then it will mean I will have spent 3 years getting to the start line, assuming an oct 25 start. Which, if I'd have known that at the very beginning I could of and maybe should have done a whole new degree from scratch. Which would be in the right order and covered the basics I am currently missing. Would have also been a bit dull but still would have been 3 years.\\All fun and games really.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that is a lot.\\
Really hope tomorrow provides some clarity.\\Here if you want to talk it through tomorrow\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That's a pretty good summary in fairness :grinning-face:. It is all first world problems as well.\\
Will certainly go through some of it tomorrow. That assumes they actually post the available PhD's. I really hope the one I saw last time is still there or similar about exoplanets.\\Let me know if you find anything interesting. I like nosing at jobs.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly I don't even know where to look apart from civil service. I want the good pension, but also the disability positive employment, hybrid working, stability etc etc\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: any mega corp will do that as well and might be better at hybrid working. EY or any of the other big 4 are annoyingly good\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: then if you get on the inside of a big company you can then move around and have them pay you to retrain\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I welcome any suggestions (or if you still have any contacts)\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But would they wait for me for 5 months?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I dont have any contacts in EY. Well, they are all in the US and dont do anything with UK hiring.\\
Yes, they would expect a 3 month wait anyway\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh boooo\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Guess I'll have to do it myself :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: although if you do find anything at EY i can always try and reach out\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: To be completely honest, I'm a bit wary of big corporates... They find it easy to get rid of people\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I've found the opposite. Easy to hide in the cracks and UK law does make it very difficult to fire someone for no reason. Big companies do recognise the cost of unboarding new people and want to retain if they can\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: onboarding\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. I'll have a look\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Any other good companies you'd recommend?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Honestly after being a consultant the main lesson i could see was that pretty much every single company worked the same way and treated people about the same. The only important thing to worry about was liking the people you work with. If you dont like or get on with the people then any job is going to be a nighmare.\\
Small companies are likely to overwork and underpay with poor benefits. Big companies have lots of meetings, good packages and are very slow to change.\\BEST BEST company i ever did any work for was the Lotus F1 team. OMG it was so good BUT i had a headache EVERY single day and you didn't have time for anything else.\\EY or the big 4 treat people well, especially if your not client facing. I know 4 people that work at Microsoft.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What are the big 4?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: OH and the easiest way to get a job at a company is to already know someone who is working there. That's how i got the job at EY\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: \url{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big-Four-accounting-firms}\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i mean you still have to be awesome but knowing someone will get you the interview much quicker\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thaaanks <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Also know someone who works at GSK. they could be good\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think I know the answer but do you have a specific job in mind like Project Manager or is it a case of any job you can do that isn't teaching\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: the other thing to do is to make sure your linked in is fully up to date and then set it to "looking for jobs"\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I usually go for something that interests me and where I actually match most of the requirements\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I'm assuming you cannot post out on facebook? Maybe ask some of your friends who they work for. I know Laura just transitioned from one job type to another. Maybe she has some thoughts on how best to transition.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Learning and development, I got told I'd be a good business analyst and PM but obviously I don't have the quals and can't go for a massive paycut\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Remember you dont need to prove all 100\% of their requests. If you can do half then it can be worth applying\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It is updated and set to looking. Feel free to have a mooch\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm getting better at that\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I saw something yesterday about it and apparently it is a big difference between how men and women apply for work. Men will apply if they match half but women apply only if they think they match 100\%\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup women tend to apply when they feel they match 100\% and men when they match 60\%\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You could always ask Cally about being a BA although I wouldn't want to work for her company.\\
As for a PM, it is a proper fake it till you make it job. If you put waterfall, agile and Prince 2 on your CV for the keywords. It is just enabling people to get shit done. I can help massively with PM stuff as before EY the consultancy firm I worked for was a project management consultancy firm\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: BA work is talking to business people. Writing it down playing it back and communicating that to technical people and then back the other way\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You can tell me to shut up BTW. I realise i have gone into full on consultant solution mode\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I appreciate it :relieved-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: ok cool, i'll keep going\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: \url{https://www.civilservicejobs.service.gov.uk/csr/index.cgi?SID=cGFnZWFjdGlvbj12aWV3dmFjYnlqb2JsaXN0Jm93bmVydHlwZT1mYWlyJnBhZ2VjbGFzcz1Kb2JzJmpvYmxpc3Rfdmlld192YWM9MTg4NzMyMCZvd25lcj01MDcwMDAwJnVzZXJzZWFyY2hjb250ZXh0PTU5OTU2ODcyJnNlYXJjaHBhZ2U9MSZzZWFyY2hzb3J0PWdlb2Rpc3RhbmNlJnJlcXNpZz0xNzAxMzYyMDgzLTBkMmM5MjQyMDY5NmFlNjk3MWM1YjkxODQwM2E4YzVhMWM5ZWNiZDc=}\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: closing date is today :grimacing-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Nothing like time pressure to help\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: will take a look\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: well, you absolutely smash their essential list\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: For the cover letter you could take each bullet point. Write your answer \/ proof to that bullet point and then delete the original bullet. Boom, cover letter with full evidence\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: can I send you my CV for a look?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: sure\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: it's a blind cv - cs asks for that\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: blind?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: no identifying info\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: gotcha, Where is there local office. The link doesn't work for me\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: it's national, but London for me\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Blind CV.docx <attached: 00001397-Blind CV.docx>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah but they give a link to their offices that doesn't work. Was just interested\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know, there are 3 links that don't work ..... Justice digital <This message was edited>\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: comments :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I didn't really look through the current and previous job stuff as i assume that is correct. Just looked at the stuff i know i would read if i was checking the CV\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: If i'm reading a cv i look at the summary then the skills. If i still like it i might then look at skills in current role. Then go push to next stage\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: so it's not shit?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: very much not shit\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :)\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: right, lemme get to it...shall send over for proof\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: thank you :kissing-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: sounds good\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: np, hope it helps\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: if you haven't worked it out yet I actually like helping\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: and I appreciate the help\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: it does also help that I actually have some experience in this and it is a damn sight easier than quantum mechanics :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: for later, could be worth a look \url{https://jobsearch.baesystems.com/search-and-apply?-level-of-experience-checkboxes=experienced-professionals&-location-checkboxes=frimley%2Clondon%2Cmilton-keynes}\\
Couple of old colleges are contracting at BAE\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: doone\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh no. No parent tech support over the phone!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly :face-with-rolling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Might just be me reading on the phone but the last 2 paragraphs are a different font and you don’t have your name at the very end.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Can't have my name on it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh, that explains it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh they come up the same on my computer :pensive-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh good. Just the iPhone being weird.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll save it as pdf anyway just in case\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good plan. When is your seminar?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll have to watch it recorded. Want to finish this\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Currently can't get into the damn system\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: For them he seminar or to submit?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: To submit\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: My friends wife who is a recruitment special might be able to talk you through your linked in if you’d like. Not sure on when yet.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hmm, try a different browser?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aw thank you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm in!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: There is zero ways that I would come of well after you talk though :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh god. What am I going to find out?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's the statement looking?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Only good things. Probably. She mainly knows me from a different time in my life.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Other than the font it’s great\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Brill\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I haven't eaten yet :loudly-crying-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ouch, seems the theme of the day.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What have you been up to?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Gave myself a headache working through step 1 of a solution in the book :man-facepalming:\\
Just had dinner and now about to play some games with Matt. Trying for an early night but we shall see.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m guessing you’re getting food and then a sit down from the panic job advert?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, all submitted\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But normally I'd have to write behaviours but it only asked for CV and statement again. So now thinking I buggered it again like on the last one\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well, you didn’t bugger anything. Just have to see what this one is like.\\
Half the time they give the role to someone internal so bin off all the external applications for that reason.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I feel this in my bones\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: Looks pretty similar. You applying?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: yeah tomorrow. deadline is sunday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s a bit better then. Less rush.\\
Aren’t you busy during the day tomorrow already?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just have the appointment at 1. Carpenter was supposed to come but got held up on another job :face-with-rolling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh does that mean you get your door fixed?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well he's not coming tomorrow, so not yet...\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, sorry I thought that was your 1pm\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no no :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What’s your 1pm then?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Counsellor\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I got a new weather app...\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: WTF weather app is that :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's called WTForecast\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Had a good evening?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was alright. Just finished a few games and now in bed.\\
Did you get any more hats done?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh you're really are having an early night!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well, trying.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How were the games?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Blimey that one looks nearly finished\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not even half way :loudly-crying-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Games were ok. Still not sure of the point. Doesn’t really have any steaks. Just seems like a time burner. Did it today really to speak to Matt as today was his last day at work. Long story.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You can tell me tomorrow :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Nearly half way then. That’s good for an evening\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Really looking forward to tomorrow btw\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Me too :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Phew, that could have been awkward :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha. Did you think I wasn't??\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No, I thought \/ hoped you were. Plus that was just a funny way to say it.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I've got a tiny little something for you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh! That feels like the sort of joke I should make.\\
I’m intrigued\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh it's really nothing\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Still intrigued.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll wait till tomorrow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha you'll have to\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I told the girls you're coming with me on Sunday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: OH!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Shouldn't have?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not a problem for me.\\
What did they say and who are the girls?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You’re already assuming tomorrow date is going to go well then?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Am I not supposed to?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well yes, I am teasing. Tone really doesn’t work in txt\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No sometimes it doesn't\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well I assumed Sunday was a done deal?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okay\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Will I get in trouble because I haven’t seen elf? He says hiding.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You haven't seen it??\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Nope\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think I’ve seen bits but not start to finish\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: <attached: 00001510-GIF-2023-11-30-22-25-40.mp4>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Anyway. What did the girls say?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh nooooooo\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just kidding\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They said the more the merrier\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You see, I can tease too <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I see\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm hoping I'll make it back in time for the start\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That will be a long day in London!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh don't even. I'll be absolutely shattered\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Setup for success then\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: An appealing prospect I'm sure\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: All depends if I’ve got to carry you home or not\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Most probably :woman-shrugging-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll be less than your deadifts\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That could be interesting as I was thinking of walking in\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll be driving don't worry\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh I’ve no concern that I can easily pick you up\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I just might have been thinking about asking for a lift home :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I can definitely offer that\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Can all be sorted on Sunday.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Of course it can\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Are you planning on parkrun on Saturday?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll walk it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, was planing to.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh shit I just came into my bedroom and realised I stripped off my bed earlier :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone::woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone::woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I was going to say it depends how late it goes tomorrow but I known I’ve probably got until about 9pm :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Doh, that is a mistake\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha, if you're lucky :winking-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good thing I'm a master at changing sheets\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: There is a joke there somewhere. Just cannot see it.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I best leave you to your sheets and I should get some sleep. Big day tomorrow.\\
I’ll say that I don’t remember the last time I would stay up texting someone.\\Night.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Done!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well you're not staying up ! :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night. Sleep well x\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning! You're up early! Spin?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m up early! What about you?\\
I’ve got a PT session with Hannah.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh really?\\
I actually put  an alarm on to go to the gym :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh, stalking me again :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I didn't know you had a sesh :face-with-tears-of-joy: and to be honest I just woke up so it will be a while till I get there\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Friday morning is a good time. It is normally dead.\\Don’t wear yourself out for later :winking-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, I'll try. What time is your PT?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: 7:30-9\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that's a long one!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll see you there I guess\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Car is frozen solid.\\
Yeah I’ve been doing 90 min sessions for a long time now. Better for heavier weights\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good thing I only need to walk over. Hopefully I won't slip and slide\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Watch out then. Walk like a penguin\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I always do!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00001562-GIF-2023-12-01-07-19-59.mp4>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Car park is like an ice rink\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh brilliant\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: First problem is solved. PhD’s are out and there looks to be at least 3 that interest me. Now the scary part :grimacing-face:\\
Nice seeing you this morning.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh brilliant! Tell me about them tonight.\\
What's the scary part?\\It was lovely seeing you\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Applying for them :grinning-face: well that's not really the scary part the scary part is not being accepted. More scary than asking you out :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oof that must be scary then  :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have you spoken to mark about the pizza thing?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I messaged him last week or something and got myself added\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh cool. Just thought about it because he posted on the FB event page\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: probably would have helped if I actually signed up to the event :man-facepalming:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I went to invite you and you are already marked down as going\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: literally just hit the "going" button\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha. Well done!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Done. now for lunch\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well done. What are you having?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i'm not sure I can bring myself to have that huel stuff 2 days in a row so will find some other pasta things.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeaaah :grimacing-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Such a shame about the huel\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: yeah, i'll go back the weight watchers chicken curry.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Is it nice? I've got a lot of thoughts about WW\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: its pretty good. Just expensive. I'm not a fan of WW as a company or teaching people about weight loss but the chicken curry is ok\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm sure there's a recipe out there for it :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Probably, I never even thought to look :man-facepalming:\\
Good session?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: A big one\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: oooh, in my experience that's probably a good session then\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes but definitely have a therapy hangover now\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I remember those. You can rest for a bit now at least\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've got to get ready! I have a date!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: yeah but you have 90 minutes\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just about enough time....\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: ok, men do have some stuff a lot easier\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: at least give yourself a few minutes of rest as long as that doesn't up any stress\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You do!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I took your advice and now I'm running late :face-with-tears-of-joy: could I please have 10-15mins?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sure. Is it 10 or 15 though\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 12.5?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sure\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Home. Thank you for a great evening. Your amazing.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you for a lovely evening too.\\
:smiling-face: You're not bad yourself either :winking-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hopefully we can try again tomorrow after Marlow….\\
I’ll let you sleep. Night.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah. Keen?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Erm, yeah. :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy: good to know\\
\section*{Saturday $02\textsuperscript{nd}$}
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Morning. Hope you slept ok.\\
Your amazing.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning! In and out but got some sleep. How about you?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, I'm liking this new sign off\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00001612-GIF-2023-12-02-07-52-55.mp4>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I slept ok. About normal.\\
Definitely feeling the gym this morning.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh me too. Hoping the walk will ease out my bloody hips\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s my hope. Loosen it all up again. It’s good that’s it’s currently   -1 outside\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ooooh that's cold\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you here?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Where?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Outside\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm inside\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't rush from the coffee popette.\\
I'm starting to feel quite unwell so I'm just going to do a flying visit to Marlow - is it alright if we go together the next market day?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sure, no problem. Take care of yourself.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you sure you're okay with it?\\
I'm sorry, bit genuinely feel like shit and I know I'm not good company like that.\\I'm glad you came walking with me this morning :smiling-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Absolutely fine. It’s horrid trying to be on form when you feel bad and  know you want your market stuff.\\
Obviously want to spend time with you but want that time to be good.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you for understanding.\\
I'll definitely see you tomorrow x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: And we need to plan on a repeat of yesterday as well :winking-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, that too\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you find your drug dealer?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00001632-GIF-2023-12-02-12-23-44.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I did but Marlow is an absolute mission. There's literally no parking, I head to circle around like twice. But just about to leave and have  a proper bath :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What are you up to?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh glad you got restocked. Marlow is crap for parking. Not sure I’ve even tried during the day on a Saturday.\\
Just having some lunch. Then I might look at these PhD some more. Need to shower at some point. Maybe some games before this evening but will see\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It was mental. Managed to squeeze into a high street spot on my second go around just because someone was leaving.\\
Hope you have a good afternoon. I'm going to have a nap :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thought you were having a bath?\\
Hope you feel better and get your job advert done.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nap then bath. I'm too cold not to be snuggled in.\\
Thank you :smiling-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: <attached: 00001639-GIF-2023-12-02-13-26-00.mp4>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did the nap and bath help?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No bath yet but woke up from nap not knowing what century I was in :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just tackling the job app\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your afternoon been?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: does that means its a good nap or a bad nap? Well done on the doing the job advert.\\
I emailed some people I was recommended about the PhD. Will see if they come back with any advice. Then played a couple of games with Matt who is now about to pick me up so we can have a few drinks.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I had a thought\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just a thought as it is always no if you dont ask. I'm not sure what time your heading to London tomorrow but I thought I could drop in for a quick drink while "passing" to go to oxford. All based on how you feel when you wake up\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm not sure, but I'm still a bit groggy.\\
Every single application I have done in the last couple of weeks has a different format :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone: and they are all through the same portal.\\Oh well done on the emails, hope they come back with some info\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You may have successfully summed up government work with your applications\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'd love to say yes but I know I'll be rushing in the morning. I have to leave around 10.30-11 to drive to Burnham and got to wash my hair (takes bloody ages) and get myself ready. It will be definitely a walking stick kinda day.\\
When are you heading to Oxford? And how are you going?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh, you’re leaving earlier than I thought. Worth checking.\\
I’m driving to the park and ride and then getting the bus (shudder)\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that will be fun. Are you getting the airline?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Aiming to get there 11ish but it’s not critical. One of these things that might be amazing (like you) or a bit naff\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Is that the park and ride bus?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah goes from the airports to Oxford\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: To be honest I've taken it loads and it's better than most\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Maybe then. I’ve never done it before\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well most busses remind you that the train is actually ok. Soo\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Train is so much better. But this is a comfy bus. And that's coming from a hurty girl\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll find out soon enough. There isn’t a better way. No where to flipping park or id just drive the whole way.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You could park in Westgate but not sure how much that would be\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The park and ride does seem cheap. I’ll check again in the morning if it’s raining as it’s a bit of a walk.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah it's like £4 for 10 hours or something.\\
Job app done\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: When are you heading to Matt's?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done on the job. Hopefully you get something from at least one of them.\\
I’m here now. Didn’t do kebab and just had a very beige dinner. The co-op always disappoints\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, beige buffet :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I really hope I get one of them. There are couple others waiting in the 'to apply' queue\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have a good time with Matt. I'm just running a bath\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Enjoy your drug bath :grinning-face:\\
I keep thinking about last night btw. :winking-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh do you now?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, really enjoyed myself and you are amazing. It can only get better.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm glad you enjoyed yourself :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
Watch out for all the amazings so I don't get a big head :face-with-tears-of-joy: (not really)\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Obviously I’m hoping you somewhat enjoyed yourself as well but yes. I did enjoy myself and you are stunning. I really mean that.\\
That can only work out well for me.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Of course I did. Do you think you wouldn't know if I didn't? :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
And also... Awwww :smiling-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m pretty sure I’d know if you didn’t but it’s always nice to be told.\\
Seriously, wow!\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I did enjoy myself :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good. Just the start as well.\\
Really excited to just get better and try all sorts of things\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We don't need to rush anything. It'll all come\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your evening with Matt?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Very true. No rush and it is nice to have lots to look forward to. Although part of my brain doesn’t like that logic :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Evening ok. Just chill. Few drinks and chat.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, you need to tell that part of brain to be patient.\\
Sounds nice! Enjoy\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m not sure sure why that part of my brain still has a voice.\\
We just opened some sake. It’s interesting\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha what do you mean by that?\\
Oh dangerous. Hope you don't suffer too much tomorrow.\\I'm off to bed. Night x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m not entirely sure. I think it’s the cave man part of my brain or maybe just the male part that wants sex. It battles the logical part.\\
\section*{Sunday $03\textsuperscript{rd}$}
We only shared half a small bottle so hopefully tomorrow is on. :crossed-fingers:\\I’m back home now anyway.\\Just off to bed myself. Night.\\Still thinking about yesterday and looking forward to seeing you tomorrow.\\Your amazing.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Morning. How are you feeling?\\
Hope you have fun with your friends later.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00001686-GIF-2023-12-03-08-19-48.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning. I'm achey.\\
How are you? No consequences from the sake?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m ok. Maybe a very small consequence could have been a lot worse.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, I'm glad. Hope you have a good time in Oxford :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Should be interesting as I have no idea what it will be like but at least it’s cheap.\\
Sorry your still achey, is that something that will stay the same for the day or can it go up and down?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm sure it will be a good day out.\\
It usually gets worse throughout the day so I might be a husk of a human by the time you see me :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: well i'll still like seeing you.\\
Just checked and think i'll take your suggestion and park in Westgate. A little bit closer to where I need to go and I avoid the buss\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm really hoping I'll make it back for 7 but even if I'm late I'd still like to go to the film. I'll keep you updated.\\
Ah nice. Hopefully it won't be too busy\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just have to see how the day goes. You wreath making activity is at an odd time\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah well. It's more to see my friend rather than anything else\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I had another brilliant idea btw.\\
With your MOT tomorrow were you just planning on waiting at the garage?\\If you like I could pick you up so you could wait at mine?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I was, it's usually only like 20-30mins. But if it's longer I could come to yours :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well I think the second option is better :thinking-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Of course you do :face-with-tears-of-joy: we can see what the sitch is tomorrow :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Another brilliant idea for your calendar. Next Sunday. Assuming I’m not completely dead. Did you fancy helping me setup Christmas?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Also I know where I’d like to eat on my birthday\\
\url{https://prelibato.co.uk/}\\I’ve wanted to have a date here for the last 2 years.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just got to Burnham. Wasn't as painful as expected. You in Oxford yet?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You are filling up my calendar when I'm supposed to be resting :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Yes, if I'm not dead after the Saturday then I'd love that\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And definitely, I'll book. Could you drive though? :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep, been here about an hour. Very dangerous. Seen 2 printers I’d like!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sorry for putting such demands on your time :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
We can spend some of it lying down :smiling-face-with-horns:\\Was thinking late morning at the earliest for Sunday anyway.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah I can drive\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just got an email about the learning specialist job.... Didn't get an interview :loudly-crying-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Booo,\\
On a Sunday!\\Any reason given\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nope. Due to large number of applications we will not be providing feedback\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I really thought that application was good\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s a bit shit and I struggle to believe a government employee is sat there on a Sunday reading job applications.\\
They might be using a computer to pre reject things somehow.\\For the next one put the job advert into chatGPT and ask it pull out the top 10 keywords they might be looking for. Then make sure those words are in your cv and statement\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Onto the next though. Your amazing.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It is. I actually used the exact words from the essential skills too.\\
Gutted\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Very strange. Could be worth pushing for feedback as it doesn’t sit quite right to get rejected at the weekend\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh well done :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's Oxford?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The show was good. I’m back home now. Didn’t take very long to look at everything.\\
Soo many people out and about. Oxford is a slippy place.\\90\% of people driving seem to have forgotten how and walking about 90\% of people look super miserable.\\I did not win at the raffle.\\How’s London?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh boo for not winning the raffle. At least you'll have a second chance tonight.\\
It looks lik I will be on time. Just on the train back, guess it depends on traffic after. Will you meet me there?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Very true. Weirdly 2 people won 3 times.\\
Don’t speak too soon but that good. Probably easier if I meet you there. Probably going to cheat and get a taxi as I think it’s raining.\\How are you feeling?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Fingers crossed I'll make it.\\
I'm absolutely shattered and in loads of pain.\\(Do you have any ibuprofen at home you could bring with please? I've ran out)\\Will be a miracle if I don't fall asleep\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s not fun.\\
I might have some. Will check.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sorry nope.\\
Got loads of paracetamol.\\I do have some naproxen? Which I have for gout and I have some Co-Codamol\\There is a little shop opposite O’Neils that might have some. I’ll check when I get there.\\Have you taken your 5pm drug?\\I’ve added ibuprofen to my shopping for Wednesday and I’ll get some of Amazon for tomorrow.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Trying to learn. Is the pain specific to somewhere or like an all body flu pain?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh don't worry, I've got some at home.\\
I haven't taken my meds today :loudly-crying-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: All over. Mainly hips and arms today\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ops, was that on purpose or by mistake?\\
I’m guessing they are different from painkiller and don’t “kick in” after taking them.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: In purpose. And I wasn't home. They are more take in the evening, work in the morning type of med\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh, interesting. So you’d take them now for tomorrow but that doesn’t help you today.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah something like that\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: See you at O'Neill's just before 7?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sounds good\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Do I need to bring anything. Either for you or for the event. Otherwise than cash (for the event not you :grinning-face:)\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No nothing (apart from cash) needed\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Taxi is on route.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Why didn't you drive in?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I just got here\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thought about it but might have a beer.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah far enough\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: 16th December Saturday. Would you like to join me at a friends birthday food in town?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm hooome\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yay, does spud still like you?\\
Really nice seeing you. I’m sorry you’re suffering for it. Hope you manage to get some rest and find more spoons over night.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I was already shouted at for being a bad mother and starving him half to death\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: He seems fine with now :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you for coming tonight. I know I'm not the best company when I'm hurting\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: \url{https://me-pedia.org/wiki/Spoon-theory}\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No one is at their best when they are in pain. That’s not a you problem. That’s a pain problem.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Already found the spoon theory.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Makes a lot of sense but\\
Do you always have the same number of spoon and on different days tasks cost more spoons or does the task cost stay the say and the starting number of spoons changes per day?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The first one. There are days when I can do so much and then there are those where showering and eating takes all the spoons\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Gotcha. The math is the same just wanted to get your approach. And I guess bad nights would start you with less spoons but the spoon cost could be low.\\
I thinking too much.\\X many spoons per day and once their gone it sleep time\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m also assuming saving spoons doesn’t work\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No not really. It's more like I'll have to borrow from the next day\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh, like drinking steals joy from tomorrow.\\
So any spoons left at the end of the day just reset. That also makes sense.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: The aim being to always have at least one spoon left without borrowing from tomorrow\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll stop talking about spoon now\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :spoon:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That would be ideal\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you for trying to understand\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll try.\\
Very similar the the energy concept I have seen for extroverts and introverts\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Similar, yes\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well I appreciate you wanting to spend your spoons with me\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Before I forget, quick question\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Is there anything I should check before I take the car in tomorrow?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That the lights work would be my only thing and that you don’t have any warning lights on the dash. Some washer bottle fluid as well.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have washer fluid if you need.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I have a full bottle in my boot, but thank you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Should be ok then\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: God I hope it passes :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: would resent putting more money into it :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just see what happens, then we fix anything that’s needed\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Right, I'm going to try to get myself halfway comfortable and try to sleep\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good luck. I’ll wish you good night then.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night, sleep well x\\
\section*{Monday $04\textsuperscript{th}$}
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Morning. Hope you got some rest.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00001780-GIF-2023-12-04-06-42-58.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning! Couldn't fall asleep for ages :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
How about you?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh that’s no good.\\
I was fine. Bit late and then up early for spin but otherwise fine.\\How are you feeling this morning?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was spin?\\
I'm still hurty and bit all over the place. Will try calling the GP to see what's going on and then the mot\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Spin was a bit rough. Shoulder was messing me about and a hard class in that it seemed to go on forever. Room was hot.\\
All over the place mentally?\\The hurt,  more or less than yesterday. Is it like gym DOMS.\\Sorry for all the questions (I have more) I like learning and want to try and understand.\\Did you want me to pick you up from the MOT place and you can wait at mine. I have tea and cake! And a hug :smiling-face-with-open-hands: and I can listen.\\Good luck with the doctor.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: The place I had a thought about yesterday for job was this\\
\url{https://des.mod.uk/careers/vacancies/}\\But you can put a pin in that.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sorry your shoulder is giving you grief. What's going on with it?\\
A little bit of both.\\I hurt a little less than last night, but that was more like 12\/10 and today is like 8\/10.\\It can be localised like DOMS but most of the time it's just all over.\\Don't worry about asking. I don't tend to talk about it otherwise as I feel like I moan\\If it's like 30mins I'll just hang around there but if it's more can I text you?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yes, this is all on the CS portal so I see local ones when I look :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:. Thank you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Today is 8\/10 wow, that does suck.\\
Don’t know why but I had a thought if Valium does anything? More in helping get to sleep.\\My shoulder is a naff rotator cuff which I’m pretty sure I knackered a long time ago when I fell of my motor bike (see more cool things about me, maybe) but only worked that out about 3-4 years ago.\\I must have been tensing it today. Just something that hurts for no reason ever now and then.\\You’re not disrupting my day btw if I pick you up just to take you back a short time later. Just if that was your thought as to why you would wait.\\Obviously I’m here if you want to talk about things.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I function on regular 5-6\/10 on the daily so the 8 is not "horrendous"\\
I'm really trying to avoid the big meds to be honest because most of them make me a zombie the next day. Took me a year to find the one I'm on at the moment\\Motorcycle accidents, so very cool :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\Well I hope the shoulder eases up. I've got good drugs if you want :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\Oh it's not that. Just how I am, I like to be there to watch them.\\Thank you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\What's your plan today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh,  what was the level on Friday then?\\
So does your scale start at 5?\\I guess the pain goes away if you’re unconscious just stops everything else.\\What made the crash even cooler was I hit ice.\\The pain isn’t that bad to need drugs unless it’s gout. If you ever see me take ibuprofen know that it is bad as the drug disagrees with me.\\Also I have tablets arriving today for you. Well, I’ll keep a box and a box for your car.\\Might take you up on the drug offer if I’m a massive wuss after the vasectomy.\\Well after you’ve finished watching them you could come over? I can even offer Huel along with the previously mentioned stuff.\\Plan today which I’m procrastinating a little on is my quantum mechanics assignment. It will be the worst piece of work I will have done in the last 10 years and I really don’t like it.\\I’m going in a bit of a circle on my mind over what to do about it as me not being able to do it well is effecting my other work.\\I was secretly hoping to see this girl I like because the last 2 times I’ve seen her I’ve missed out on a hug.\\Got a PT session with Hannah at 5 and then a meeting with my robot club at 8.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Somewhat side stuff. Based on our spoons chat yesterday and the thing I said on the 16th. That won’t be a good event to meet my friends for reason I can explain better in person. I’d much prefer if you’d like to join me at Matt house on the 23rd. And meet Matt, Michelle and Lester there. Plus at least one dog. Then you could either leave when you want or we can leave together.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Also based on spoons. Thursday, we can save going out out if that would be better. I’d really like to see you but I know Friday night and Saturday night are big nights for you plus the plan for you to mock me putting up Xmas decorations at some point Sunday.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sorry that’s a lot.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Friday was like 5 in the beginning and like 7 after you left :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Not necessarily. I sometimes wake up because of it. Hence my rubbish sleeping.\\Oh jeezus Christ. That's why I never got on motorbikes\\You can take other pain meds instead of ibuprofen if it disagrees with you.\\Oh thank you. I've got a massive stash at home, just didn't take any with me yesterday. Brain fog\\Oh yeah, the v will be uncomfortable. What date is your procedure?\\Haha, I'll pass on the huel after your review. I'll let you know what's happening.\\Oof that's a big one. You just have to sit down and get it done. Best approach with things you don't like doing\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh now I want to know the reason!\\
The 23rd is definitely a good option. I think I'd prefer that if that's okay\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No, we're definitely going to that restaurant for your bday. I might book it for 5 but we're going :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I meant if you take the big drugs that make you unconscious or a zombie it takes the pain away but you don’t know about it.\\
That is awful if it wakes you up.\\With you going from a 5 to 7 is that because of the time or because of what we did?\\Motorbikes are bad. That’s why I don’t still have one. Fun but basically a ticking clock as to when you’re going to get very hurt.\\V is on the 24th and I still don’t know when your birthday is other than it’s after the 21st.\\I did mean Huel drink. Not the thing they claim is food.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’d prefer that to. The only reason is that while I know most if not all of his friends they are not my friends and it’s a dinner sit down thing in town. So no idea who we would be sat with. So you might end up meeting people who I know but aren’t my friends. If that makes sense.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok, just wanted to throw options out.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh! It's more they make me a proper space cadet the next day so I wouldn't be able to do anything, like drive, work, function as a real human.\\
What we did and the late night :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\Oh so the v is my birthday present :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: my bday is on 23rd\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okie, we can pencil the 23rd in then :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It can be your birthday presents if that counts :grinning-face: but good it’s the day after and not before. I’ll only be jet lagged so that’s better.\\
The late nights we can work on but I really don’t want to be causing you pain.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha. :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Yeah, I will need fewer late nights that's for sure, last couple of weeks have been hard.\\You're not causing me pain, promise\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok good. I will keep checking. Just to warn you. It’s a whole thought process spiral I can get stuck in if I’m not careful.\\
Any luck with the doctors?\\Also had another thought (I know, just a thinking machine) moving away from serious chat to lighter stuff.\\These dresses you need to try on. Probably need to try with various different underwear to see what works best. I’m assuming anyway.\\So, happy to give my thoughts if you want to send over for review. :winking-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's okay but please don't overthink it. You can tell when I'm not well and I'll also tell you :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
Spoke to the reception and they sent me a link to fill out online so I did that so I guess I'm waiting now.\\Haha. First I need to figure out if I even have anything that will work. I really need to try them on today or tomorrow and return what I'm not keeping\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Erm, not overthinking is not an option. That will always be happening about absolutely everything. I have got loads better at not believing a lot of the thoughts but they still happen.\\
Some progress then with the doctor. That’s good.\\Well!\\Clearly only one option. Try all underwear with each dress and send them all for me to check.\\I’ve overthought every possibility and the only other option beyond that one is me being in the room helping.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Right! Go do some work! I'll text you later x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Work is being done\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's going to be about 45mins\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So, would you like picking up?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes please :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: ok, be there in 5\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Passed. Just tires on advisory\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00001816-GIF-2023-12-04-13-12-58.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also, sorry if I'm a bit weird\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just so I know, which occasion of you being weird are you talking about? :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
That’s ok. I could see your in pain, tired and clearly having a high mental load day.\\I had thought of a few things I could do to you while you lay down but I think you’d have just gone to sleep.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: My kitchen is cleaner now\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: All occasions :beaming-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
I just need a couple of quiet days to be honest. These last two weeks were supposed to be all about me but I've overstretched myself. And I'm stressed about the GP too\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, well done\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Why are you stressed about the doctor?\\
I can tell you feel guilty about work and not doing things but you do need to take the time that’s needed. Fighting it will only make it worse.\\You’re not doing it on purpose.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hope you get a nap in.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't even know. I think it's the whole am I going back in or not.\\
I bet you wish we didn't start this during my actual worst time :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You'll just have to see what they say but I guess the question is do you think (not want) you should go back. As an outsider it looks like it would be best to just write off the rest of term. Only 10 days left anyway. Review everything in the new year.\\
Obviously it would be nice if you weren't struggling with things but if this is your worst then ok. The wish I do have is that I would have asked you out 4 weeks earlier when I had the chance.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly... I don't think I should go back just yet. But if I don't, I really have to ramp up my looking after myself\\
Ah well, better late then never, eh?:face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: See, you know the answer. Hard part done. Maybe we put a pin in the self statement you made about you knowingly not looking after yourself.\\
That is what they say. I'm just glad I didn't wait any longer.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Me too. I just need patience, it's been a while :face-with-tears-of-joy: I'm an 80 year old stuck in my ways\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: one of the most infuriating conversations I had with my therapist was on patience's. "Do you know how you learn patience's? Be patient"\\
Just prioritise you and being your best self. Your not OLD.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I mean patience from you :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: I know I can be weird\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: aren't you meant to be napping\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: OH\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: well hopfully i'm giving it to you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Too wired and need to put shopping away. Also why the fuck do I go to Sainsbury's. Always spend too much money :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone::woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You are. You have been very understanding and I appreciate it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I dont go to sainsbury's because I used to work there. Plus if you walk about you'll always buy stuff and shopping hungry\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's because they have the bits Aldi and Lidl don't. I only go like once a month but always ask myself the same question\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's the assignment going?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: its going great\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: there really needs to be a good way for sarcasm to work over txt\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Focus :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: My brain just came back to this one. Been a while for what?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Opening my life to incorporate someone else aka a relationship\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh right. We will get there. One step at a time.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Omg I still forgot to bring you the thing. It's going to be redundant soon :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, I'm guessing you just saw it. How did the call go with work?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It was alright. They care about me and I feel guilty about it :woman-shrugging-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I sort of understand what you mean. BUT people actually like caring about people and they like helping people. Being cared for and receiving help isn't a weakness. You dont need to feel guilty about people caring for you and wanting to help you.\\
All you need to do is care for yourself.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well that's a thought that has come up a lot in therapy :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
One of those childhood trauma bits :woman-shrugging-light-skin-tone:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: i'm guessing it also has something to do with not being in control and having \/ needing to rely on other people.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've always had to rely on myself so yes, quite a bit of that\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope your PT session is good :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thanks. Are you cat, food, hat making, drug bath, bed type of evening?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, yes. That's exactly it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well, enjoy. Got completely ruined at the gym. Trying to work out if you feel this all over and suspect it’s worse. Very much not fun for you.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah glad you had a good session!\\
Haha, yes,  variations of the gym pain.\\Dinner and robot club?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s the plan. Dinner done. Then proper nerd speak. Today’s presentation is on sensors. More interesting than you may think. A shower is needed as well.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm sure it does! Enjoy it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Amazing how long we can talk about LED sensors :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Assume you might have gone to bed already. Hope you get better sleep than last night.\\Night.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just tucked myself in.\\
\section*{Tuesday $05\textsuperscript{th}$}
Glad you had a good time.\\Night night. Sleep well x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Morning. Hope your still asleep and got more rest than last night.\\
What’s your crazy plans for the day? Dresses, sitting down and crocheting?\\Did you sort the doctors?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning! Why are you up so early?\\
Thank you, I slept a little better and think I'll go to the gym.\\I haven't heard from the GP yet so not sorted yet. Stressing me out.\\What are you up to today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Spin class. The joke is that I’m consistently up earlier unemployed than when I had a job. I do get a lie in on Wednesday and Sundays.\\
What you planning on doing the gym? Does that help at all with the pain or just give a nice reason as to why things hurt?\\Why you stressing over the doctor? Don’t you just need them to sign you off work?\\Try not to worry. Very hard to do but it will all get sorted.\\Just uni work today. Gotta dig deep and just get this shit assignment finished then see if I can get my astrophysics chapter done in time for a tutorial later.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah well done!\\
Just the usual.\\It's a little bit of both tbh. I have to move otherwise everything gets worse but the DOMS are so much worse :woman-shrugging-light-skin-tone:\\It's because I need to let work know and can't do that until I speak to the doctor\\Good luck with the assignment, buckle down and knock it out!\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: So the choice is pain for no reason or pain for some reason.\\
Obviously I here and willing to sacrifice if you want to “move” :winking-face::grinning-face:\\That’s like 2 things! (Very obscure internet joke)\\It’s crap but also objectively simple. You got this and it will be good. You can then focus on you for the rest of the year.\\Thanks, it’s a mental block issue around delivery complete dog shit work because I don’t know how to do it and me having to accept that. I’m not the best at failure.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha exactly that.\\
Of course you are :face-with-tears-of-joy: such a sacrifice \#saint\\As soon as I hear from them I'll be alright. I don't like uncertainty and I like to know what's happening\\You can do it!!!!\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I know that one! :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Nerd\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Of course! I literally only post memes on my insta stories\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No looked for your insta yet\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :eyes::eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’d already figured out you like control and, like me, you don’t like other people being in control of things that are very important to you.\\
Then I watched you wait for your car to be MOT’d :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\Also, of course I’m a saint. It all selfless.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I'm not good at waiting :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well, you hid that poorly :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't even try to hide it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Right, gym time. And work time for you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just as well as it is not hidden\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Enjoy.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I just had a bit of an overthink moment.\\
Are you ok with me teasing and joking about us having sex? My overthinking is that you’re interpreting it as pressure which is not my intention and I know we have to be patient.\\It’s actually me trying to be flirty and making it obvious that I do want you. Just in case there was some doubt, which hopefully there isn’t.\\Overthink over.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't worry, you're good :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Cool, I’ll keep doing it then.\\
You have 4 posts that are nearly 10 years old on your insta!\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: My insta is private\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's not my insta\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't even know when I set that one up\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's my start up days\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sneaky, have an old one that easy to find to distract from the real one.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :winking-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: @chick.norris\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Double sneak using a fake name.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Be warned. I may now send memes\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Booking at Prelibato is confirmed for Thursday at 6 :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Brilliant. Thank you.\\
How was the gym?\\Any news from the doctor?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Gym was okay but I had to take a nap.\\
Had an email from GP and apparently they gave me the wrong form to fill in yesterday so I had to fill in a new one and now I have to wait.\\How's the assignment?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: probably a pretty good gym session then if you had to take a nap :grinning-face:\\
:man-facepalming: sometimes you cannot make it up. Can you at least tell the school your not coming back this year and the doctors note will follow? Only if that helps with stress level.\\The assignment is the absolute worst piece of shit I have ever done. I'm not sure if and when was the last time I was this unable to do a piece a work.\\Then, as if to haunt me, my astrophysics work this week is...…..\\*The quantum physics of stars*\\Soo mean.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I pretty much have to take a nap after any activity :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Well another 2 weeks would take me 2 days away from end of term :face-with-rolling-eyes: I don't even know if they'll extend it. I don't like this\\You're really having a time with it. Sending good vibes so you can finish it!\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: So what your saying is that your a cat :grinning-face:\\
2 days! I’m almost 100\% certain when you ask a doctor to sign you off they sign you off.  But the 2 day extra is just a pain.\\Thanks, the whole thing is\/has made me very uncomfortable.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I mean, we know I am a cat.\\
We'll see what they come back with. Just hate the waiting around.\\You can do it, push through!\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s always frustrating waiting for others. Hopefully not too much longer.\\
What you doing this afternoon? Dresses, jobs, sitting?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: The supervisor looks mad that you’re in his spot.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No no, I'm in my spot. He just likes the warmth :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is cool wool.\\
Are you procrastinating over the dresses or not got the spoons for it today?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I keep forgetting. I need to shower etc and then try them on. Will do it tonight! Call me out if I don't please\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That why he was staring!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Will do.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: “What! Put the blanket down”\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I always think he knows something I don't when he's being super cuddly\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Like what?\\
I know dogs can. Maybe he senses the stress?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Or owners notice their pets affection more when they need it the most.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I keep seeing the odd video of working dogs that alert their owners to medical stuff. Very clever that the dog is faster and more accurate than the computer monitor\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: He definitely senses stuff and knows when I'm not well\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: They do seem good at that. I remember my dogs would be very well behaved the few times I was sick. Like the knew they weren’t going for a walk and were ok with it.\\
Good that he is keeping you company.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done. Really like the colour gradient.\\
How many more are you wanting to make? <This message was edited>\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I really need to take stock!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Omg 8! I think. I won't be able to do that\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: you've made 8 or want 8 more?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 8 more according to the list\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: how long did the last one take to make?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Long. But if I were to do just the crochet I'd knock it out in a day\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: quite a while then. You'd just need a new hat every 2.5 days\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Dress reminder\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you see Katie?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, just got back\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's assignment?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well it’s done but it is shit. Going to sit on it till tomorrow and then submit. Slim chance the astrophysics chapter makes something click.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Could you get a job where Katie works?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha no! I don't have the financial quals\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good plan. You might have some more ideas tomorrow\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: All I hear my friend talk about is spreadsheets.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Unless I magic a Time Machine while sleeping it will be what it is. It’s only 2\% of the grade so the assignment itself isn’t actually a problem. It’s the unanswerable question of how important it is for next years plans which also sort of don’t matter because if it is vitally important it doesn’t magically make me understand it.\\
So maybe it just doesn’t matter (the module)\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh you never know. Fresh eyes might help.\\
I'd offer to look over it buuuut...\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Right, I've tried the dresses...\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And….\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Narrowed it down to three\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Three I thought you bought 2\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hmmmmmm\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I got 5 to try.... Will return what I don't like\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok, you didn’t try in store then?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Anyway, I cannot exactly help you choose if I don’t know what they look like\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no. Bought 3 online\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okay okay\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't look at my face or hair\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just checking these are all the same one right?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Wait\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I see the difference. That’s a real test between 1st and 2nd.\\
First of all.\\Holy shit do you look amazing.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Wow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Any favourites?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: If I had to pick then it would be the first one. Hard choice between 1st and 2nd.\\
I mean you’re stunning in all of them.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I was going between 1st and 3rd\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Are the sleeves warm or are they just going to flap about? I’d assumed you’d have some sort of jacket thingy and the sleeves on the 3rd one would get in the way.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm just going to have my coat\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The sleeves are nice\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What have the girls voted for?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well murder mates have so far voted 1 for each\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Helpful\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Out of 1 and 3 what is the most comfortable?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I guess you can ditch 2 as it’s not on your list\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll have trouble driving in either :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I do like it, but I guess not as much\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That doesn’t help much.  Meant to be choosing not adding more back on the list :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to return the two I didn't show you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That makes sense.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: But I’m also assuming you don’t need 3 new black dresses\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No I don't\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Here is some reverse logic for you then. You like 1 and 3 I said 1 and 2. I somehow always seem to guess wrong on 50\/50 stuff so you should go with number 3\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 1 has more votes over all\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: But do you like that one the most?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll forward you a message my friend used to describe it :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you tested sitting down in them?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Maybe that will be the decider.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I need to get some Bridget Jones pants to go with it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The first one makes you look like a hot ex wife that got the house, the car and the bloody business too. You look stunnnnnning! :heart-on-fire::fire::heart-on-fire::fire::heart-on-fire:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: This is the type of hype I get from the murder mates :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: lol, that is great. My hype game is weak.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's not\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But girls just do it different\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How many option are you going to send over for this?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: None!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Do you know what they are?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ve seen the film\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The big pants :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yes but what I meant was I can see those in contrast to other options you have.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Isn’t no pants the “best” option with a dress like that?\\
Although completely wasted if I’m not there\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Gym shorts?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Fridays pants were very nice.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: TMA01.pdf • 5 pages <attached: 00002008-TMA01.pdf>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: My brain short circuited\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But they would show\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha nooo\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: it get worse the more you read :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: what options do you have then given it Saturday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: have you made a choice?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: M\&s\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think n1\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: its a great choice\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: thank you for sharing with me.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Of course\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: you say "of course" but its not a given. I know I was teasing about it and I obviously wanted to see them but I also understand the vulnerability for you to actually send them. So, I appreciate it.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well, you're welcome then :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Now I've got to think of something we can do so I can get you to wear it for me\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You'd better be getting that suit then :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: hmmm, I have a jacket.\\
Any of your friends getting married any time soon\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nope\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: maybe we'll have to do a fancy date then. I'm guessing it wouldn't be the best option for a ballroom dance\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh very little movement in there\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: maybe in the short term you'll just have to model it for me in your flat :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: When's your tutorial? Now?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: well, that wasn't a no :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yes, the tutor is a VERY slow talker\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Enjoy!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Focus!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I am. You in that dress. :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Save that for later :winking-face-with-tongue:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: dont worry I will\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: that was actually a very nice tutorial. Much more fun when you understand things\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i'm almost afraid to ask but did the doctors get sorted?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that's good!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nope\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: usless. (them not you)\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Are you all sorted for Saturday now or do you need emergency big girl pants\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Emergency big girl pants needed\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I have to go to next to return the two dresses anyway\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: what about the other 2.....\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll keep them till Saturday, final decision then and then got to send them back Next week\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :face-with-tears-of-joy: so you've choosen but just in case you choose again your keeping them\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Gotta have the hair and face done!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: silly man question. that changes the dress?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Changes how the whole thing looks put together\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: on the plus side I guess that means I get new pictures\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Maybe\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: or maybe I just get the final picture.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What final picture?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just the end result of what dress you pick all done up for saturday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: rather than all the options. If you only wanted to send one\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ooooh yes\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: did you get any interesting info when you saw Katie? (just being nosey)\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: On what?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: anything, always wonder what people talk about with friends when you see them fairly regularly\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, oh just what's going on really. My crap, her work, just a lot of chit chat\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What do you talk about with your friends?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: generally its nonsense. Either movies or video games. Sometimes talk about relationships. Like on Saturday we had a bit of moaning session about my friends Lester partner as she always seems annoyed and just seems to do what ever she wants.\\
Some people have asked about you, mainly my female friends. or before you they would ask about any dating stories.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh what did they ask?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: stuff and things :grinning-face:\\
No doubt very similar question you get asked.\\Who is she, where did you meet, what does she do, what dates have you been on, how often have you seen each other. How is it going. etc\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Stuff and things, eh?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What have you divulged?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: just stuff :grinning-face:. How we met, what dates we have been on, that I like you. My friend Giles who lives in the US was funny. He did a checklist.\\
Lives close\\Eats normal food\\Drives a car\\has job\\Doesn't want kids\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ooh I check off aaalll those things!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: well its funny because if you ignore the first and last one they shouldn't need to be on the list but they made it to the list\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: oh\\
Owns own place was on his list as well\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm the whole package :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: well, yeah.\\
I used to think people were asking because they wanted some funny story or at least I could try and make a funny story but I realised it they are interested because they want things to work. They have seen the things i've been through.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah your friends genuinely want you to be happy\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: that's a fairly new revelation for me.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: what have your friends asked? as I imagine its different questions\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: or I guess what I should be more scared of is what you've told them\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Like most of them either know you or know of you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They ask how's it going etc\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The usual\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: that is a little odd I guess and even more so that it means they have mainly seen my cursing and moaning at a run or in the gym\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha probably\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But all of them assured me you were lovely\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And brave for asking me out at PR :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i wasn't left with much choice\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: and i already said how i fluffed doing in the car parl\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: park\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Maybe it wasn't the right timing. have you thought of that?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i just ran with the theory that people arn;t really paying attension so i guessed no one would see me ask or they'd leave it if they did\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: in the car park? Maybe, and i was thinking about that yesterday based on something you said.\\
If that is true though then it does start to send you down a rabbit hole of wondering if we do have free will or if we are just part of a simulation that is partially pre determined\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What did I say that made you think?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i knew you'd pick on that bit\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Go on then\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: let me find it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: here we go.\\
So this answered a question i was going to ask you about if how you are now is "normal" or bad. Answered by your saying this is the worst.\\SO, my stupid thinky brain got thinking. MAYBE it was a good thing I didn't ask you out 4\/5 weeks earlier as I may have seen you fall into where you are now which could have impacted all sorts of things.\\This way round its just a case of working through it with light at the end of the tunnel. Rather than the light at the end of the tunnel getting further away.\\I have a chance to help and support you.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What all sorts of things it would have impacted do you think?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I don't really know as it would have only been a few weeks but my overthinking brain on unfiltered mode can make up the scenario where we got into a little routine, then you start going downhill and closing up, think your being a burden and just tell me to get lost (or something) OR I do some thing similar. Standard overthinking full on catastrophizing.\\
I think in realty we would just be a few more weeks ahead and would have had some more dates and I would have seen you naked a few more times.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy: the last bit\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I would have definitely closed off and isolated, you're right\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Which would make sense. We have just lost a double date option as my friend Becky had to break up with her boyfriend at the weekend as he had completely shut down for 2 weeks and wouldn't even talk to her.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh lord. That's not emotionally mature of him at all\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: correct, a real shock as he seem'd quite normal. He was (is) 51 and I think it was partly the male generational thing of trying to deal with it all himself. Which really reacted very badly to Becky's personality.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think in the grand scheme of things 4 weeks isn't going to make a difference\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't think it will\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I mean, good on Becky for choosing herself\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: the stupid short term part of the brain really wants the 4 weeks but it really wont matter.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That was real growth for her. She has not had the best of times. That's a whole story part of which got added to the "reason XXX not to have kids" list\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You can tell me another time (or not :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:)\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i will, better in person story so you can ask questions\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You know I will\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: will just have to wait till she gets a new boyfriend for the double date\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Is it just the possibility of extra naked views? :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: in what was a hilarious difference between men and women dating online. At the time i dont think i'd had a date in over a month. Becky activates Hinge. 2 dates in the same week :man-facepalming:and one of them turned into the boyfriend she just dumped\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How old is Becky?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Erm, Not going to lie but yes that would be nice but also just more time that we could spend together and get to know each.\\
naked\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also, you guys assume it's just a sausage fest for us on the apps but there are definite issue with the supply chain, product is faulty :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: my age. 41\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I don't assume. I've seen the math. There is a lot of faulty product. Your just able to access it and see it much faster :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Speaking of apps, I've decided to hide my accounts...\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: oh, we having THAT chat!\\
I need to actually disable things but I stopped checking or using the apps the day I got your number\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Doesn't need to be a chat of you want. I'm just stating facts :grinning-face-with-sweat:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I was sort of teasing with the first line. But the second line is facts as well\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm sure the 'cards on the table' policy is well established between us\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: what i think most people don't know about is if you don't actively stop your account (definatly on hinge) then your profile keeps getting shown to people\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I like and fear this policy\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah, why the fear?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The fear is there because my first thought is always going to be some sort of Catastrophizing.\\
Its like the joke you see all the tv and film. Nothing good happens from "we need to talk"\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-rolling-eyes::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: mine are all hidden\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We can revisit deletion down the line :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: of course\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: if you want a dark humor joke. Its best to delete them anyway so that the algorithm likes you again when you sign back up.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i did want to read your hinge prompts though. i only glimpsed at them the other day\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You know what's funny..\\
I actually got bumble premium about 2 weeks before you asked :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\Told myself, I'll do this properly for 3 months and then bin all the apps\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: that is funny. I deliberately bought a subscription on the theory that that would happen. Didn't quite work that fast but i think my Boo expires in feb\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Your boo?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Boo - was a dating app i signed up for. Utter rubbish, well more rubbish than most.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I have never heard of that and I've been around the block a few times\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i think Match is the worst or at least was the worst for me. My friend Toria met her now husband on it so it works for some\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Match is horrible\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: all just kept coming back to Hinge.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: None of the 'premium' are good. All the same people everywhere :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have a theory.\\
The app that works best for you matches your personality in some way. Or its the app you like the most and therefore find people you like\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: tinder and bumble dont have enough information. Match etc has too much info about a person so you judge too soon. Hinge is just enough to spark and interest and get a chat going.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good theory\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: or what i think is actually more true is that people just need to meet people in person and see if they like each other\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah that too\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I like this one.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I can teach you to paddle board as well. When it warms up :cold-face: you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Aren’t you about ready to turn into a pumpkin?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've already learnt this summer :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Fine! It can just be  a normal date then\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Soonish. Just finishing an episode of a docu\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: sounds good\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Murder docu?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s a first then if I’ve made it to bed before you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No. It's about this "cult" called Twin Flames Universe\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Woo hoo :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Lie in tomorrow?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep, just got to be awake for shopping at 9\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I spent the last half an hour panicking about whether my return date is tomorrow or Thursday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And it’s Thursday?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well the note runs to the 6th so I told school 7tg\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think that's right\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You told me it was Thursday\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's what I'm thinking\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you not told them you’re not coming back yet?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Was just questioning whether I got it right. But if the last date on the note is 6th then return should be 7th no?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No because I don't have the note :loudly-crying-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You’ll get the note\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And I won't know how long they are signing me off for <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’d just tell them in the morning and then pass on the doctor note later.\\
I’m pretty sure you can just tell the doctor how long for unless it’s a 2 week fixed thing\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I did tell my HOD I'll let her know Wednesday\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm panicking now\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: There you go.\\
No need to panic.\\Worst case, you don’t need a doctor note to phone in sick. If you tell work you’re not working they have to deal with that. Doctor note is just paper work.\\Plus I’m quite certain your union could kick up and all mighty stink if the school gives you any grief.\\But I do also know you feel guilty about letting people down. Which your not. You have to take care of yourself first.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's more the timongs\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Whether they are expecting me tomorrow or not\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The timing seems to be the stupid way it all works.\\
Well if your HOD is expecting an update tomorrow they can’t be expecting you in tomorrow plus you joked that you were meant to go back to work on my birthday\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Regardless I would just message them tomorrow and confirm that you won’t be back in for the rest of term. Doctor note to follow due to a proper work issue at the doctors\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Paper work issue\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll text her tomorrow to give her a heads up and then email in\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good plan\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Such a panic just took me\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sorted now or at least a plan is sorted\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Need some deep breaths\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sorry\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You don’t need to be sorry to\\
me\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well it's going to take some time to wind down now :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What took me forever with work is the “it’s just business” thought process. Even when you know people and care for the people at work. It’s just business.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm keeping you awake now!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I get a lie in.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's honestly just the timings this time round. I was only thinking about having messed them up\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s not on purpose. You’d have done it yesterday if you got the paper work\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully it comes through\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: If you message anyway then it’s less important in the moment\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Vibrator :winking-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't think I need to call in. I've checked the email I sent and it does say 'return should be 7th Dec if recovery goes all well'. I'll text my HOD in the morning saying I'm waiting to hear from GP\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: There you go. You can still prompt that it hasn’t gone well and you won’t be back this term. Then they know\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Full of good ideas you are :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah. I made a whole career out of it. :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Recommending vibrators to people???:eyes::eyes::eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, not that bit :grinning-face:\\
But if your asking I have some suggestions\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh don't worry, I'm well stocked\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh really! Well that does create a lot of questions\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You're not going to sleep now are you?:face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well it’s not helping.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: 2 questions to start with.\\
Do you have a remote control one?\\And then the obvious question. When do I get test then out on you?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 1. I don't\\
2. Patience\\:face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Need to solve the first one and sort of glad in the second one. I absolutely would have got dressed and drove over but also it’s late :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, I'm sure you would have.\\
Another time\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah. I’ll wait.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I best wish you good night before any other crazy ideas happen. Night.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh one more question..\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've noticed you don't do 'x' on texts. Just something you don't do?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not something I’ve done before. I can if you’d like?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No, if it's not your thing. Was just wondering\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s like the words of affirmation. Also something I’m not good at.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It can be my thing if you’d like?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly it's okay. If you feel like it, great. If not, same :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Okay.\\
So, are you going to be using my suggestion to wind down or you just going to sleep.\\Night. x.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm just going to sleep\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night, sleep well x\\
\section*{Wednesday $06\textsuperscript{th}$}
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Morning. x.\\
Guessing you might not have slept well if you’re awake before I am?\\Were you worrying about school.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning!\\
Yes I didn't. Just on hold to the GP.\\Did you sleep well?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not the best. I do wonder if a lie is worth it sometimes. This afternoon will tell.\\
Sorry you had a crap night.\\Good luck with the doctor and work. It will be done soon enough.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you.\\
What's your plan for today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Rock and roll day. Rest day from the gym.\\
Out shopping away. Uni work and then I meeting up with a couple of people from my robot club this evening. That should be fun.\\You? Big pants shopping?\\Doctors sorted?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ooh what are you shopping for?\\
Still on hold, queue position 8 :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone::woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone: it's been 24mins\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh it’s nothing exciting at all I’m just getting my food delivery for the next week and it has some stuff for the party on Saturday. They didn’t have any alcohol free mulled wine though.\\
:man-facepalming: it is painful. Have you emailed work while you wait?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh you meant put shopping away. I thought you were going shopping :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
Aww thank you for looking anyway. I heard Lidl has some so will have a look\\I physically can't email them until I know more. Stupid I know but :woman-shrugging-light-skin-tone:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I told you it was a rock and roll day. I try to avoid actual shops as best I can. They are normally full of people.\\
I’ll have a look in Lidl on Saturday then. If I remember.\\I missing something as that is stupid. I am not a fan of procedures with broken logic.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No not missing anything. It's a me thing rather than procedure thing\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well got through after 35 mins only to be told sick notes only through website, no appointments. But it has been passed onto the Dr and will be dealt with this morning\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :man-facepalming: just pain.\\
I get wanting to do thing in order but when other people mess up the order I start going rogue.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Same. I'm back to being very stressed :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Because you’re waiting on the doctor?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know it's not rational but...\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Knowing it isn’t rational only helps a little bit.\\
Would it not help to just tell your HOD that your not coming back and tell them that the doctors is messing around with the paper work but you’ll get it soon?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: As it seems the stress is related to you not telling form because you think the doctor will somehow make you go?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Form should be work\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes I think so\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The doctor isn’t going to make you got to work. They would never do that to anyone.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: They might get involved in legal stuff and his seekers type stuff but that isn’t what is happening here\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What's that?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Even if you assume that the doctor said you should work (which they won’t) you know yourself that you need the time off. So you can still tell work you won’t be going.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: His should have been job.\\
Really nailed it today on making sense.\\I was just assuming that if a doctor had to fill out some form for a person to get benefits. Then they might make sure you’re actually sick.\\As a thought process. But that isn’t this situation so there is zero reason the doctor won’t give you form.\\And the point I am poorly making is that while you do need the paper from the doctor is sort of doesn’t matter because your not going to work anyway.\\Thus you can tell work you won’t be working.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You're very good at talking me down from work related panic attacks :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: This was a big part of my job. Not just recommending vibrators.\\
Take a problem. Break it down. Fix it.\\What you have is at least 2 problems not 1 problem with a critical path.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think you should tell work this morning as the doctor might still get it wrong or have follow up. Which will make the stress worse for you because you then won’t be able to give work a lot of time for them to sort the rest of the week (next week is far enough away for them to fix)\\
So, if work at least know that your done for the term (I’d use different wording)\\Then they can plan staffing for that etc.\\The whole reasons why and paper work is a separate stream of work.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I can also imagine why you want the doctor stuff up front. As it is proof. Do you have a fear or think that people think you’re making it up?\\
Only as I know that’s what I was thinking when a doctor signed me off work.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh definitely. Because it's not just the fibro. And they keep asking me if I'm in lots of pain, but honestly that's very much a secondary thing here\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You can just tell them yes. They don’t need to know what type of pain it is. Or just tell them it’s pain and other stuff that I don’t want to talk about.\\
I think it’s all a bit odd to explain how sick you are when you’re not going to work. It doesn’t matter, I won’t be working.\\That’s what I used to tell people anyway. Tell me if you’re not working and a guess at for how long. The why is secondary when planning cover etc.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The problem is that the department is a little more than just colleagues and they know what's been going on on the physical side so they ask. I know it's coming from a good place but still\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: We can call that problem 3.\\
It’s the awkward bit when your friends with people you work with but you can and should separate the personal from professional in some situations.\\From the work side they just need to know what’s happening so they can staff.\\The rest is going to be your colleagues caring and the HR bit.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: To HOD\\
Sorry for the delaying in updating you about my return but I was waiting on paperwork from the doctor that has now been delayed to the point that would severely impact your ability to provide teaching cover.\\I am sorry to say but I will not be returning to work for the remainder of the term.\\Please arrange for my classes to be covered.\\I am currently unsure what this means for next term but will be able to update you before the start of term (or some other date)\\Lucy.\\Something like that and I assume you send this to a deputy or another key stage leader.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you. I'm going to take a breather, have some food, take a shower and deal with it after\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good plan\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: If you fancy a distraction would you be able to give this a quick read?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Proposal introduction email.docx • 2 pages <attached: 00002285-Proposal introduction email.docx>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's really good\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: A non-standard qualification set\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And the second part of the last sentence...\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope it doesn't come across picky :grimacing-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thanks, that why I wanted you to read it.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: picky is good in this situation\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Any news on your stuff?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's a good enquiry email\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nope\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Bugger. What's the plan?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Trying to not think about it right now\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: ok, then :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to see Jenny for a quick coffee in an hour and if it's not here by then I'll be sending texts and emails\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :thumbs-up: Not your fault the doctor is being slow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly buggered my whole morning\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I can tell.\\
With or without, the result is the same and I'm guessing you trying to hold back disappointing people.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But it also tells me that if it was the right thing for me to go back I would not be having panic attacks or feeling like this\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: that result will happen anyway as its obvious that people at work will want you to come back to work. Plus your friends obviously want you to feel better, which you dont. Delaying telling them only makes it worse for you. There reaction will be the same if they knew yesterday or today.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is quite telling as well\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know all of this :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: that's good. My thought is if you tell them now. They get to read it over lunch. You can have a nice coffee with Jenny, withouth additionally stressing about it. No doubt 8 seconds after you tell them you'll get the info from the doctor or the doctor will still fuck about and it will be later\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They're all teaching now anyway\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: but wont they have lunch soon?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll deal with it, promise\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know you will. Just trying to be the unemotional voice of logic\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know. But I feel really pressed at the moment, which is stressing me. I just have to go through the process\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But that doesn't mean that I don't appreciate you and your help x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i'll keep trying to help and I know that I dont know all of it but I do know it is tough.\\
Much easier for me to just say stuff. I'll leave it with one last thought which I sort of said already. As a manager, the most important thing I want to know is if an employee is going to be working or not. The rest doesn't matter, just need to plan for the yes or no.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: reworded to be\\
While my background is not the traditional path for a PhD student I believe this enables me to bring a huge amount of experience into a PhD that would be lacking from a lot of applicants.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Do you want to use the word lacking?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: no, just read it and it sounds wrong\\
While my background is not the traditional path for a PhD student I believe this enables me to bring a huge amount of experience into a PhD that would be an asset when compared to other applicants.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: While my background is not the traditional path for a PhD student I believe this enables me to bring a huge amount of experience into a PhD that would make me an asset when compared to other applicants.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: English hard\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Into a PhD programme\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: is that not implied?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: added\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: As you say, hit them in the face with it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: thanks. Going to get lunch and then send it. Apply for stuff is just a real pain\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've had minimal input :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Applying is a bitch\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Enjoy your lunch\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: you read it and said it wasn't crap. Very helpful\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It came through\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: End 2 days before end of term :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Finally!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Somewhat expected as it’s for 2 week blocks.\\
I’d still tell work the rest of the term and get new paperwork when needed\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I will\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Your school ends on that Friday then. My nephew finished on the Tuesday!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Chest is a little less tight\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm still going to try to book an appointment with the Dr on Monday (that's when she's next back in) to talk about options\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good idea\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Options are always a good thing\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Text and email sent\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: well done. Good Coffee?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes it was lovely catching up with Jenn\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How is your afternoon?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That's good. Does she work at a place you could get a job?\\
Afternoon is a bit slow. Lacking a bit of motivation but sent off the 3 emails to each of the 3 PhD's and submitted the worlds worst assignment. So progress.\\This current chapter i'm reading is just a drag. Not flowing as nicely as the previous 2.\\You doing anything for the rest of the day? Pants shopping etc\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, she's council. I've had a look but nothing.\\
A bit slow? You've done so much! Well done.\\You can do the chapter!\\I'm going to try to slow my heart rate down :face-with-tears-of-joy: I just need to relax and unwind. Probably a bath at some point.\\Where are you meeting your robot friends?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Council would be good. Slow as shit work but has to be near zero stress due to the speed of work getting done.\\
Think i'll shower to get some energy back and see if I can finish the chapter before food.\\Well you are meant to be relaxing. Its done now!\\Meeting at his house on the other side of Wycombe. He lives on the road I lives on as a kid and where my flat was. Funny when that sort of thing happens.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah that's why I have my heart set on civil service\\
I said they signed me off until end of term and I got an email back saying to send the sick note. But that only says until 20th:woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\Hopefully I can delay and get it sorted when I see a doctor\\Ah cool. What will you nerds be doing? :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I said, any big company would also be similar with probably higher pay. It’s it big enough it all slow. Some people can still find a way of making it stressful but that always confused me.\\
That was expected. I’d send what you got with a note saying the form can only be for 2 weeks at a time and that  you’re seeing the doctor next week and will get updated paper work. I certainly wouldn’t worry about the paper work.\\I don’t know that we have an agenda. One of the guys I’ve not met before and is new so probably talking through how to get started. Duncan (whose house it is) did a presentation to the group on Monday so probably going to talk about that as well. I want to see if he’ll make up some of the PCB’s he was talking about as it’s will be a lot easier for me to buy them off him that make my own.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That should have started\\
As I said before.\\Didn’t mean that to sound harsh\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I was a bit *shocked Pikachu face* :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't know what PCBs are but I hope you have fun\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: PCB are circuit boards.\\
I want to design my own at some point but it’s a whole software suite to learn first\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aaah ok!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Chapter complete. Got quite interesting near the end. Plus got a response from one of the PhD people which is encouraging. There is hope.\\
"What you describe sounds like a perfectly plausible background for that particular PhD project. I think probably commitment and intellectual ability are the two most important attributes for a PhD student. Astrophysics research is quite computationally intensive in general so the skills you bring are very valuable. Some undergraduate physics and astrophysics would also be very useful; which OU modules will you have studied by the time you aim to begin the PhD? It’s also useful to be able to write well, and speak well especially about technical things.\\From what you say below, you seem like a good prospective candidate. We select on academic performance as demonstrated by grades – it’s useful to include your A level grades as this is the last stage where there is a nationally uniform grading system, and also on performance at interview.\\"\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that's a really positive reply!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Do you have physics and astrophysics?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s the modules I’m doing now.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah brilliant!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Which PhD was this from?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: This one\\
The Dispersed Matter Planet Project: Machine Learning applied to space telescope data to find transits and new host stars\\Which isn’t my most favourite one.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: But is probably the one I’m most qualified for\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Which one is your favourite? The spotty stars?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I thought it would be but I think this one would be the best\\
Untangling Gas, Dust, and Ice Astrochemistry with JWST Ice-Mapping\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ooooh\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well let's see what you need for that one\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, I think it will all be very similar. Just got to apply and see. I’m hoping not that many people apply. That will really help :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha. Well you can only do your best!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How has your evening been?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Pretty good. Nice to get out of the house and to talk some nerd stuff. Need to actually do something about it and get my mouse working.\\
How are you doing now?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I'm glad you're having a good time. Are you still with the boys?\\
I'm okay. Michelle stopped by to drop off my dish after the west Wycombe Xmas fair so we had a cuppa and chatted\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just got back home.\\
I did what you did the other day.\\Stripped the bed…\\That’s nice. 2 friends in the same day.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh nooooo. Now you have to dress it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, I know. She just called she was coming\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Maybe she sensed you needed a chat.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: She definitely checks up on me :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also, just wanted to say thank you for dealing with my freak outs over the last couple of days :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s ok, you’re welcome. I’m not sure I did much but I’m glad it helped.\\
Most problems are a lot less once they are said out loud.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just want you to know I appreciate you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Aww :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
Thanks.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 1 HR 8 mins left!!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :man-facepalming: yep. Made it another lap around.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Glad you did\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Bed all sorted?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Almost. Bit later than I wanted but that’s normal\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm all snuggled in\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done. I will be soon enough.\\
I have a question, like you did yesterday\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Go on\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Pause for effect :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Do you like the morning and night time texts?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I do. Why?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just checking. I thought so. They aren’t something I’ve done before.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh really?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, I’m not sure why. They happened really naturally with you (like quite a lot of things). Not something I’ve done with another partner.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well I'm glad they did\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Me too.\\
I should probably wish a good night. Big day tomorrow, I get to see this girl I like.\\Night. x.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Big day indeed\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night x\\
\section*{Thursday $07\textsuperscript{th}$}
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Morning. x.\\
Let’s see if spin was a good idea today :grinning-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Happy happy birthday :partying-face::partying-face::partying-face:\\
Hope you're having a good morning xx\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thanks.\\
Spin, was not a good idea. I was the only one! Makes for a very awkward \/ strange class. Good gym after though.\\How are you this morning?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you having a nice bday breakfast?\\
Ah the only one :grimacing-face: but well done on going and smashing it!\\I'm okay. Big headache since yesterday but fortunately someone lovely has stocked me up with meds :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m hoping to have a nice breakfast but more brunch really. Meeting my brother at 10:45.\\
That was nice of them :winking-face: I got even more with my shopping this week. If I can get to the right place in the US I thought as a super shit present I can get you a huge batch of them. They sell paracetamol and ibuprofen in boxes like they are sweets. None of this 32 tablets at a time rubbish.\\You doing your returns \/ shopping today?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh lovely! Where are you going?\\
It was very lovely of them :smiling-face:\\Aw, cute! But will you be able to get them back in here?\\Yeah I'm going to pop into town very quickly to return the two dresses (thanks for the reminder)\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Going to Peter Lee. It’s in prestwood, I think I’ve been before. Farm shop \/ cafe. I think.\\
Well, if they fit in the suitcase then yes.\\Massive :briefs: as well. Who knew they had an emoji for that :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh nice! Enjoy it, hope the food is nice\\
Hahah, there's an emoji for everything :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: What time should I pick you up later?\\
Good idea as well asking me to pick you up. Otherwise there could have been a very high chance you’d accidentally meet my parents.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 5.30 \/5.40? That's enough time to get there no?\\
Haha, are they going to be at yours?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: 5:30 is probably safer.\\
Yeah they are coming over this afternoon.  No doubt there leaving would be “delayed” if they knew you were picking me up :grinning-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha, I bet it would!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki, let's do 5.30 :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Looking forward to seeing you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :smiling-face-with-hearts: me too.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Home. Thank you for this evening. Your amazing.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm glad you had a lovely evening.\\
You're quite amazing yourself, you know!\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I take your word for it.\\
I best wish you good night so you can finally sleep.\\Night. x.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You definitely should!\\
\section*{Friday $08\textsuperscript{th}$}
Night night. Sleep well x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Morning. x.\\
Hope you slept ok after I kept you up late. Looking forward to seeing you later.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning!\\
I've been up since half 4 :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\How was your bday sleep?\\Me too :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ouch, that is not a lot of sleep! Do you think you’ll have a nap later?\\
I slept ok, just up early.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I will definitely have a nap later :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: \url{https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGe8U3NDv/}\\
This is what I talked about yesterday :smiling-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That looks like a nice place and not far away at all. End of May.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It looks amazing :star-struck:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No reason you shouldn’t be able to go next year.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I really do want to\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Lovely seeing you this morning :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
even with the sweat?\\You to.\\I have found it somewhat amusing that even before our first date you have seen me looking my absolute worst. Today was bad\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Even with the sweat.\\
I mean, you've only ever saw me in gym gear with pippi longstocking hair before that too so :woman-shrugging-light-skin-tone: I knew only way was up when I scrub up :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah but there is quite a big difference. First of all you look smoking hot in your gym kit.\\
Second, I’m not actually sure there is a second.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahahah.\\
Thank you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You cute tooo\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hmmm, if you say so.\\
Thank you.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: <attached: 00002437-GIF-2023-12-08-09-41-32.mp4>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I will try.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Also, did you see the old couple that were at the gym?\\
They have become a new life goal of mine.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I did. They are super cute :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I should have said yesterday. Thank you for the advent calendar. It is very thoughtful.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh you're very welcome. Just sorry it took me an age to get it to you :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s ok. Makes todays one very good :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah. Enjoy :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Is this the sort of thing you were talking about with tea storage\\
Healeved Bamboo Tea Box Wood Tea Bag Organizer Storage Holder Stackable 3 Layer Tea Caddy Container Tea Packet Rack Teabag Shelf Tea Station Stand for Snack Sugar \url{https://amzn.eu/d/2Yl92cw}\\Or something with more draws maybe?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, but bigger I guess :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Or more than one.\\
They seem to do draws that would stack.\\Good nap?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Maybe. Couldn't store and loose leaf in there though.\\
A long one.\\What have you been up to?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Super duper busy me. I sat down with a coffee and 2 hours happened.\\
Should be going out in a bit for a coffee with my friend Becky and then will get on with some more uni work.\\Quite tired today for some mystery reason :winking-face:\\Plus I knew I was going out and it blocked my brain.\\So you also need something to store the loose tea in while that is then stored in a thing.\\Does a long one not equal a good one? :face-with-rolling-eyes:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, that always happens. And I get the brain block so completely understand\\
I am knackered! We really need to work on those late nights. Won't be able to do that when I'm back in work\\Yeah, maybe, I don't know :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\Not necessarily. I work up after like 30 mins and then fell back asleep. Just feels like I need mooooooore. But will get out and move\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I haven't yet found a technique to override the brain block.\\
Well as an FYI I do really like sex in the morning. Much less tired or really anytime before late bedtime :face-with-tears-of-joy: Afternoons etc\\Can you get another nap in before tonight. 3 late nights in a row is a lot for anyone.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Me neither.\\
Haha, do you now? Well me too. I have been know to wake up in the middle of the night and get it on :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\(P.s. I want to have all the sex but also don't want to this to just be sex. I actually enjoy spending time with you :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:)\\Not today. But there will definitely be more naps tomorrow\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Same - on the sex part. There are 24 hours in the day. 23 hours and 59 minutes has to be spent doing other stuff :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
I'm hoping you don't think I only want this to be about sex because that isn't true. I obviously want to have sex with you but that isn't all I am after.\\What you may have worked out (as I think its obvious) is that my past isn't exactly full of satisfying sex life. So I have a lot of excitement about finding one, it will take time.\\I'm on board with the whole being woken up for sex thing. One small issue with that. We would have to both be in the same bed …. :grinning-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: I am pretty sure we take longer than 1 min :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: otherwise I wouldn't be tired!\\
I didn't think you did. But you know, cards on table and all.\\Coincidentally, what are you after? I realised I never asked you.\\What will take time?\\Haha, very very true. Promise I will try :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: the joke wouldn't be as funny if I said 22hours left for other stuff :grinning-face:\\
I really do set myself up for some big question and maybe I dont have a great answer but the shortest version I have been able to boil it down to is. I want to be someone's favourite person and I want that person to be my favourite person. Not 2nd 3rd etc on the list but 1st.\\2 people caring about each other and working stuff out.\\Does that mean you told me the answer to that question?\\Time? I just meant time to figure each other out sexually but that is also true for personally. We really are at the beginning. I think we are doing quite well so far.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: also, pets don't count. Pets can still be 1st\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, no it wouldn't.\\
Yes you do. And I love it!\\That's a pretty good explanation. Funnily enough, I broke it off with someone once saying I didn't think I was their priority :woman-shrugging-light-skin-tone:\\Oh which question?\\Oh definitely, there is so much more to explore on both accounts. But to be honest you already know more about me than some other people :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\I think we're doing quite well too.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah, they have to be :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: it was the "what are you after?" question. My mind has gone blank if you had already answered it or told me.\\
Well, I would hope I already know quite a lot about you compared to most but I'm guessing you had some specific people in mind when you wrote that and not the postman\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aaah\\
Well I'm looking for my person, in the simplest terms.\\Haha, yes you definitely know more than the postman but I did have specific people in mind\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: now you have set yourself up. Who specifically?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh like previous partners etc\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Blimey ok. we might have to talk about that in person as that is interesting\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh why?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: not a bad thing. Just interested in things you've told me that you haven't others.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Like the more vulnerable bits, that kinda stuff\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: well, I had at least worked that bit out.\\
its that you haven't seemed cagey about talking about anything. So its a surprise to find out you dont speak to everyone like that\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no, people have the earn my vulnerability. I don't just go around telling everyone :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Does it work for you if I get to yours for around 6?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: yeah that will work\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I'm guessing we are going to the chiltern taps first then? (which is great) Parkking in Eden?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I thought we can decide when I get to yours\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: ?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup eden... Will be interesting for me :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Had a good catch up with Becky?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: either that or Sainsbury's\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: catch up got cancelled as she got stuck at work. So will wait till next time\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What did you fill your time with instead?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i may have just sat. I did go through the emails from uni. Some good information. Still slightly worried they might discount me on academic knowledge so need to be careful with the wording.\\
The interview sounds scary, but that's a problem for February\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully they won't. You previous experience is impressive and you've shown through the modules etc that you want this and are willing to work hard for it.\\
I'm very happy to proof read anything you fancy\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You okay though?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That what I am hoping they will see as well. My experience so far is that some of the academic stuff can be a bit blinkered by process or "the way".\\
I'll definitely get you to proof read things.\\I'm ok with it. It is what it is. This is just the crunch month on what has been a 2+ year journey, a 20+ year long dream AND I haven't even started yet\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Will a hug help marginally?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: will have to test to make sure. It certainly can't hurt\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm happy to test as much as needed\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i didn't think we had that much time :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: For hugs??\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: hugs can take a while\\
or they can lead to things\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They CAN lead to things...\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm ready. Is it okay if I come now?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: yep\\
\section*{Saturday $09\textsuperscript{th}$}
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hope you are having fun with your friends. I’m finally going to bed now after staying up for some reason :man-facepalming:\\
Night. x.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It was lovely seeing them. Just got home after dropping them off.\\
You stayed up late! Did you get up to much?\\Hope you sleep well. Night night x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just zoned in front of the tv and full crazy, put my washing in the tumble dryer.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh how productive :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
I am knackered. Definitely a lie in tomorrow\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00002499-GIF-2023-12-09-00-43-43.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: <attached: 00002500-GIF-2023-12-09-00-44-08.mp4>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Morning. x.\\
Hope you got some rest.\\I’m quite pleased I’m not outside in this.\\I’ve got to go out to buy some stuff for tonight. Do you need anything?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning (just)\\
It's been a sleepy morning, I've been in and out, and definitely heard the rain.\\How's your morning been?\\Aw thank you, I'm all good.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Your certainly allowed the rest. Don’t need to be stealing too many :spoon: from tomorrow.\\
Just finished shopping and was at Starbucks for a bit longer than I should have really. Home now for food then tidy \/ clean the house.\\There should be plenty of leftovers for tomorrow. I hope.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, I feel like I'm already stealing from next week.\\
Oh did you catch up with the parkrun lot?\\Hope the tidying goes quick. What time is everyone coming?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I saw a meme about that. “I already feel like I’m tired tomorrow”\\
At least you know next week you can rest.\\Not a huge amount but yeah Leon, Greg, Mike, Paul, Doug and Cally.\\Apparently it took them all an hour to lay yesterday when they went to leave.\\I’ve told people from 6pm. So who knows. I already know one friend is 8pm. We will see.\\Should be petty quick once I get started. 2 hours maybe. I’ll leave the skirting boards and top of the door frame for you :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, that's definitely the plan next week\\
The rain sounded horrendous, I bet only the hardcore peeps went.\\Ah yes, the trickle in. Hope all of them turn up\\Hahaha, don't tempt me. I'm planning on a big clean here on Monday\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It looked proper flooded so I’m glad I gave it a miss.\\
Yes, the trickle. Some of my friends are not the most reliable.\\Top of my kitchen cupboard have probably never been cleaned if that helps get you going :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\Would a big clean in your place be a relaxing thing for you?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did you manage a lie in?\\
Oh god. That's going to require some elbow grease (the product as well as the act)\\Yes, in a way. Having a clean space definitely helps the head\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sort off. The self sabotage late night didn’t help but I did sleep longer than  normal. Will try and repeat tonight.\\
You cannot get good access to the top cupboard anyway.\\Not that it matters but any thoughts on timings for tomorrow? I can always pick you up if that helps at all.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What was the self sabotage for?\\
I do own a step ladder as I am a vertically challenged adult.\\What would work for you tomorrow?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just watched too much you tube when I should have gone to bed because I knew I had a lie in. Logic :man-facepalming:\\
Of course you do :grinning-face:\\Really open tomorrow I’d thought 11 as an opening idea. Get a lie in then do some decorating and what ever lunch I can rustle up. Your doing something in the afternoon\/ evening?\\Could be a bit earlier as I’ll no doubt be up and moving by 9.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha. Solid logic. I have definitely done that before.\\
The 11 sounds good but can I say for sure later on when I find out if I'm taking Katie back to get her car?\\Yes, should be seeing Patricia for her bday at some point\\Is it going to be a late party finish for you tonight?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Timing is super flexible tomorrow.\\
I don’t think it will be a late finish. Maybe 11. Will see. I’ll no doubt have to be careful I don’t fall asleep on the sofa after. As I’ll sit down for a bit.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah, so very rock'n'roll\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep, I had suggested we could go into town later but my one friend who would go to trilogy isn’t staying for very long.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But why trilogy???????\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: There isn’t another club in Wycombe. Have to make do.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You can dance in O'Neill's :woman-shrugging-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Haven’t really tried that. Way back in the day O’Neills was not the place to go unless you wanted to get hurt.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly, it's been lovely every time I've gone. Granted I haven't been for a long time\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: In fairness I pretty much always regret it the next day. Always get too tired and the next day is a write off. Every now and then it nice to hear loud music somewhere.\\
None of it comes close to how good the clubs in Vegas are.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I think my clubbing days are definitely over\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’d very much like them to be earlier in the day and it’s good if you can see a named DJ.\\
Good would just be a booth and not have to wait.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Facebook has started spamming me with this\\
\url{https://www.shaktimat.co.uk/}\\Something that might help you?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Shakti mats are brill. I find the flat ones a bit better as they get your whole back :relieved-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Do you have one then?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No. But I borrowed one from Patri before\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Brilliant choice.\\
You look beautiful.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00002531-GIF-2023-12-09-15-04-43.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hope you have a good time.\\
Cleaning has begun\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you! Hope the party is good xx\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Laura won!!\\
Has the party started yet?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh well done for her. Earlier fight than j thought.\\
4 people arrived.\\2 bailed so far\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh boo on the bailers!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It was a hard watch\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Flaky friend.\\
I bet.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope more turn up :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Pretty sure I’ll get 6 more. Otherwise there is a lot of pizza for you :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha. I mean yay pizza but hopefully people turn up\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm finally home :sleeping-face:\\
Hope you're having a great time!\\Btw I don't need to drive Katie tomorrow so 11 is good :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh well done. Much earlier than I thought you’d be home.\\
All starting to wind down here now.\\11am works for me.\\Was the fight any good? Overall not necessary the fight bit?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Me too. But I'm glad I am. They went to continue the party in Beaconsfield.\\
Surprisingly it was really interesting. In Laura's case I think my brain just blocked out when she was getting hit so I only remember the good bits.\\Did you have a good time?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to wish you good night now and look forward to seeing you tomorrow x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night. x.\\
\section*{Sunday $10\textsuperscript{th}$}
Looking forward to seeing in the morning\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Morning. x.\\
Looking forward to seeing you in a bit. Hope you slept well.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning!\\
How are you feeling?\\I need to go drop Laura's bag before coming over so I might be 10-15mins later. Hope that's okay.\\I am absolutely shattered. I think I've used all the spoons till Thursday these last three days x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m only a little bit fuzzy from the late night but otherwise ok.\\
That’s no problem on the time.\\I’m sorry you’re so tired. 3 nights in a row breaks me so I don’t know how you do it. I’ve got plenty of disposable spoons if that any help for a boost :face-with-tears-of-joy: (joke)\\At least your mission for this week is to recharge \/ de stress.\\I’ll try not to add to your tiredness.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll text you when I'm leaving hers\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just leaving Laura's\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you for a lovely afternoon :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thank you for helping. Really enjoyed spending time with you.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Me too! I like this (and you :winking-face:)\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
Me too\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I noticed there were some really comfortable silences.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ha! Yes, I did too\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I do feel comfortable with you (in the good way)\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is kind of the point.\\
Would be very bad if I made you uncomfortable :grinning-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
You know what I mean!!\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah. I know what you mean.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Drugs!\\
Hope the bath helps.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: This message was deleted.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just took them!\\
Thank you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Patri just rescheduled to Wednesday :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: I'm going into bath now\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s works out well then.\\
What time you seeing her on Wednesday?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly, yes. I need to decompress\\
Probably after she finishes work, around 4 ish\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Nice, not too late then.\\
Only asked as we completely messed up arranging our next thing. At the moment I’m busy Monday, Thursday and Saturday evening. Free (minus doing uni work) the rest.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ooh what are you doing?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Secret things :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Monday is PT and a tutorial. Thursday I’m meeting by (somewhat useless) friend for a drink. Saturday evening is Matt’s birthday dinner.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ooh nice!\\
All the secret things :face-with-tears-of-joy: I could do Tuesday, Wednesday or Friday?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thought you are busy Wednesday?\\
Tuesday and Friday or is that too much.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh god yes :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone::woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone::woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
I can do Tuesday and Friday  :winking-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha but it’s good you excited to see me.\\
Both it is then\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Anything in particular you fancy doing?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I mean, I can think of a few things :winking-face: but I’m open to suggestions\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Of course you can :winking-face:\\
Maybe we could make some mulled wine and pay your card game?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That sounds nice. My place or yours and what time.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Mine? Honestly I don't mind either way.\\
What time works for you?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Can do yours if you like. Any time works and I know early is better. Eating together or before?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I can make something if you'd like. But I don't have a table to eat at :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I could offer beef stew as that what I’m making this week.\\
All depends on how comfortable you might be with my bedroom compared to yours.\\Could do 4pm?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh we're talking bedrooms, eh :winking-face:\\
It's worth a shot to find out.\\I can come to you for 4 :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well some of the ideas I have are maybe a little easier in a bedroom. Although the foot stool in my lounge is pretty big. :winking-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha. I'm finally in the bath\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Wow, that took a long time to make.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Teasing :smiling-face-with-horns:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Was on the phone to grandmothers\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :woman-shrugging-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hope the bath helped.\\
Idea I had for something else we could do indoors is you trying to teach me how to make a hat. Just as an idea.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: If you'd like to learn I could definitely do that :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: maybe we could do it on Friday\\
How's your evening going?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s what I was thinking for Friday as well.\\
Going ok. Matt and I are just as crap at the new game as the old one :face-with-tears-of-joy:.\\Just eating up random leftovers for dinner and finishing off watching Rush.\\How are you feeling after the bath?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, did you enjoy it at least?\\
I'm feeling better, thank you\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I enjoy it when we do something well but not so much when one us (Matt mainly, obviously) makes a silly mistake and means we have to try again.\\
So it’s fun when it’s fun and a real pain when it isn’t.\\Glad you’re feeling a bit better. Must be nearly bed time for you?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: This is very accurate for what’s it like playing warzone.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah, I get what you mean :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Almost! Going to give another half hour to a hat\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh nice. Nearly finished it?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: About half way through. Really need to go through them this week and see how many I have left\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: \url{https://youtu.be/3W-ETfHJU2k?si=ONi-G--tnJrqjpnK}\\
Some ideas for Spud.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ooh!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It looks so good but I don't think I have the skills :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The guy is very skilled and had the workshop to kill for. Part 2 is a little simpler with the shelf runs\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's going to be shelf runs round here :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: maybe I'll treat him to a box hidey hole\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: They should be really simple to do. Hard part would be the ladder but\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Or the fear when he leaps at you from one of the shelves\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ladder bit even\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha. He can't even get down from my wardrobe by himself so not overly worried\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Multiple ladders then\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm thinking something like a combination of these\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m in bed now. Hopefully you are as well. I’ll wish you good night. x.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm just about to get in\\
Sleep well. Night night x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is a lot :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: This one\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not ALL of it. Like bits from each\\

\section*{Monday $11\textsuperscript{th}$}
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Morning. x.\\
Hope your still sleep for a while longer.\\Let’s see how many people are in soon today!\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning!\\
How was spin?\\I'm just on hold to the doctor trying to get an appointment x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Spin was ok. 5 of us so that helped. Just got home.\\
Really hoping titans does spin classes or Buzz mixes it up the instructors.\\Ahh well done. Good luck.\\Is that the plan for the day. Doctors (hopefully or at least an appointment) deep clean and hats?\\You doing the Slovak shop today or at some point this week?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah that's a reasonable number.\\
Well there were no more appointments by the time I got through so have been put on a triage list so have to wait for a phone call :face-with-rolling-eyes:\\Yup that's pretty much the plan for today.\\I'm thinking the Slovak shop tomorrow\\What's your plan?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s a joke really. What do doctors have. Like 5 appointments in the morning. Rubbish.\\
Hopefully it’s a chill day for you.\\I’ve got an astrophysics assignment due this week so that’s today challenge. Got a session with Hannah at 5 and then a cosmology tutorial at 7. Which means I’ll have to eat late :frowning-face:.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah, and I got a snotty receptionist too.\\
But finally had a response from the talking therapies referral so have an app Thursday morning.\\Going to do a food shop first and then get on with everything.\\Oh that sounds big. Hope it all goes well.\\Oh boo for late dinner\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good you have an appointment. Is that the one you phoned for is the talking therapy thing something else?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No it's a different one. I was initially referred when the GP signed me off\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've got an appointment at 1145!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Woo Hoo, well done. At least that gets it done for the week. Did you get your shopping done?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup, just got back.\\
How's the assignment?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I may have got a bit distracted but sort of getting stuck into it now. Actually looks quite good fun. I've got the results back from the disaster I submitted last week and am a little afraid to look\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha what did you get distracted by?\\
Ooh look! And let me know :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I may have got a little distracted thinking about tomorrow, then it was custom making macro keyboard and what it is actually like being a full time video game streamer.\\
The usual.\\I looked :eyes::eyes::eyes::eyes::eyes::eyes::eyes::eyes::eyes:\\Its about as bad as I though. On the plus side (if it is a plus) I can self assess quite well.\\"You scored 7 \/ 60 = 12\% with almost all these marks coming from the self-reflection question.\\As you admit in Q6 this course is not going as you hoped and there is a danger that it will drag down your other modules. I am not convinced that you will be able to recover sufficiently to pass this module this time around so I would urge you to talk to the student support team to see what your options are."\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oof, will you be able to recover it a little?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: maybe if it was my only module but it isn't. I only took the module as I technically had the capacity for a 4th module in the year and wanted to maximise the learning. My only hope at the moment is that not doing this module doesn't mess up the PhD applications and even at this point if I need this module I don't see how I could pass it and still get good grades in everything else. So it sort of makes it moot for this year anyway.\\
As always I know what I should have done either from June or I should have dont a maths module last year.\\Can't change it now.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: One very small victory is that I did scrape 1 mark based on the questions. Sadly I do not understand the full answer he has given.\\
Time to email student support I think and get it all sorted.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good plan. What do you think next steps will be?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: in terms of?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The modules etc\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I'll defer the module to next year as that the least worst option and keeps some options open\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: If anything goes to plan I wont end up taking the module at all\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: but at least if I defer it the option is there\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah ok. And how are the rest of the modules looking?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: pretty good, the astro physics is hard but in a doable way. Cosmology has some of the maths I don't fully get but I can see a path to understand it. It also has quite a bit of python that I should be good at. Then the module I start in Feb is all astro physics and python. So should be relatively easy. Where easy means hard but doable\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah that's good :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: although if I get rejected from all 3 PhD applications then I will have to have a long talk with myself.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well let's not think about the worst possibility just now. Next steps are to put forward the absolute best applications you can\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: "Not think about the worst possibilities" - SURE :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
That is the plan but there is that stupid part of my brain that really wants the answer faster than I know I'm going to get it. That way I can plan rather than potentially doing work that doesn't matter.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: All work matters in some way. Will either help you now or later :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You'll get there. It's only like 2 months and you still have to write and submit the apps !\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: All very true. Going to have to put time into those either this week or more likely the weekend.\\
Good luck at the doctors\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: When are they due?\\
Thank you\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: deadline is 25th Jan but i'd like them submitted before end of year and certainly before I go away\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's a good plan !\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also here if you want me to read through anything\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: thanks. I definitely will get you to read through stuff.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Kepler-93 is a G-type star with a mass and radius of 1.09M and 0.98R,\\
respectively. It is orbited by a planet, Kepler-93 b, which gives rise to a\\sinusoidal stellar reflex radial-velocity curve with a semi-amplitude of\\1.60ms-1 and a period of 4.73 d. The photometric light curve of the star\\displays a U-shaped dip with a depth of 0.022\% that repeats with the same\\period as the radial-velocity curve.\\Calculate the radius of the exoplanet in Earth radii, explaining any\\assumptions or approximations that you make.\\Thoughts :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :exploding-head:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Out of GP. They are finally worried enough. Got another appointment on Thursday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Is that a good thing? Sounds like a good thing.\\
Worried about the fibro or the other thing?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's a good thing in terms of them chasing up my referrals and the Thursday app is supposed to be an overdue review for fibro and everything related. It's just shit that I had to get this bad before anything is being done\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to have a little nappy nap because boy am I exhausted :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Enjoy the nap. Did you stress yourself out a bit?\\
As good as the NHS can be their biggest failing beyond appointments is that they are reactive. Only jumping to action when it gets bad.\\If it was all dealt with when everything was less then people would be seen quicker treated less, cost less etc.\\you have to badger them as well which takes hours.\\Potentially good thing about a mega corp would be private medical which I’m assuming you won’t get from a government place.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes I did. I'm just so used to being gaslit by medical professionals that going in is hard every single time. Even though the paramedic was an absolute angel and did so much for me today.\\
Yeah, private health would be brilliant but very aware there is no cure for fibro but I guess they would take better care of me?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also, what doesn't help with the stress is when they tell you 'please call an ambulance if the symptoms get any worse' :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That certainly wouldn’t help. Especially as “worse” is very subjective. When were you told that?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Today\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Private would be faster. Probably talking to the same people but it would be quicker and faster access to the right people.\\
My brothers friend hurt himself on a Thursday. Nothing ridiculous but they asked if he wanted the MRI on Monday or Tuesday the following the week.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, because they didn’t have any appointments?\\
Such a broken system.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No no, the paramedic hoping they don't get worse, but just in case they do\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And the GP told me the same when she signed me off\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Fun. I can always drive you somewhere if needed.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully it won't be needed though\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I would hope not\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: But you never know and a lot of people would never dream of phoning for an ambulance\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The only time I rode in one was when I called 111 and they sent one for me about 10 years ago\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I dread to think what the wait time might be if you called for one. An Uber might be faster :man-facepalming:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Anyway your meant to be in bed relaxing\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Definitely\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am in bed\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sorry! I keep distracting you from work\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh good\\
RELAX :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yes you are a distraction :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't mean to be!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Back to work sir!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I didn’t mean it in a bad way\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well I hope you get some sleep. You’ll need some energy for tomorrow and you can have the fun of cleaning (apparently)\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to tackle some of it this afternoon hopefully\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well there is no deadline on it. Just break it up into smaller tasks if you want to make sure something gets done.\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: couple of thoughts for when you wake up \/ later.\\
Have a looked at the Paired app. Just the free version.\\Do you use the Microsoft ToDo app? We could have a one or more shared lists of things we want to do. Or we can use something to share lists.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Another random brain dump from something I babbled about at some point.\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm up! :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's a cute app\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't use the ToDo app but yea, I'd definitely be up for syncing lists etc. Shall I get it?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: \url{https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.cupla}\\
How about this one?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: The reviews aren’t great for the free version and seems more of a calendar sharing over list sharing.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: \url{https://www.cashify.in/best-note-taking-apps-on-android-and-ios}\\
Maybe keep or Evernote?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Was that a no?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No it wasn't\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm happy to do Microsoft one :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Cool, it is pretty good and links outlook as well.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did the nap help?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I'm feeling calmer.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Great. Just let me know which ones to download :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: was just going to use the free one\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I'm 80\% sure if anything is bought it works for both\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: so it should just be one question a day\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Remind me to cancel then! It wouldn't let me through without subscription\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: you should be able to cancel it straight away or i'll try to remember tomorrow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I might have jumped the gun and did one of the Qs :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: you are meant to answer the question(s). that is sort of the point.\\
You did get our first date wrong. I;m pretty sure it wasn't in 2021 :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I didn't even see the year :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: it was also the 16th\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Right I need to do this not in the middle of the cleaning\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's what I thought!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: hah\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: haha\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Can we change it?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: already done it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You're the best\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: it wasn't exactly the best list to choose from\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: whats funny is we picked the same stuff for ourselves and then assumed something different for each other\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Literally was just going to say that\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Drugs\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just finishing up. Did a deep clean of the windows and scrubbed the bathroom. I think that's it for today\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your afternoon?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sounds productive.\\
I’ve been banging my head over some equations. My calculator did stuff wrong, I couldn’t read and then just as I’ve left for the gym I know the 5th or 6th mistake I’ve made.\\I have a headache :face-with-head-bandage:\\At least the gym is a rest. This is only question 1 :man-facepalming:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: God that sounds complicated. Hope fresh eyes will help solve it.\\
Boo for a headache but hope the gym is good. Enjoy x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It already was complicated but I certainly did a good job at making it worse :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Headache gone. Now replaced with cannot move arm pain.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yay for no headache. How was the PT session?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: In PT speak it was great. In normal person speak, I hurt but in a good way.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Bath after dinner?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Probably just a shower. Will see what time it is after I have eaten.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope the tutorial is good\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: its interesting. It has already had some crazy sentences. Around the idea that things could be moving apart from each other above the speed of light\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: but once again it boggles my mind :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: its is currently breaking the minds of 30 cosmology students as well :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Then I'm in good company\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: what are \/ have you been doing after cleaning?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Made and ate some dinner, dishes and just sat down\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Survived the tutorial?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just about. I think I fell asleep for a brief moment.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m guessing you’re in bed?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Must have been so interesting :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not yet :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: finished a hat and started some mittens\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did you have dinner?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was very interesting just broke my brain. I think I had to reset. :grinning-face:\\
Yeah I’ve eaten. Really don’t like eating that late but doesn’t happen often.\\Just about to have a shower and then bed.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done on another hat. Smashing them out.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Barely\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You've had a busy day today\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Didn’t you start it yesterday or the day before\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nooooo\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: About a week ago I guess\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: As always I always think I should have got more done. I should have and could have got more of my assignment done.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well new day tomorrow! You can knuckle down and work on it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah and it will get done. Will see what can get done tomorrow. I very much should have answered each question once I finished the chapter. Really don’t know why I didn’t.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well you know for next time!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Shower time.\\
I’ll wish you good night now in case I miss it. Night. x.\\Looking forward to seeing you tomorrow.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I look forward to seeing you too.\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00002782-GIF-2023-12-12-06-33-29.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning!\\
Look exactly like that cat, had a terrible night's sleep.\\How was spin class?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, that’s crap. Any particular reason or just because it’s a Tuesday.\\
Spin was rough. Very mentally tough class. Good to get it done and 5 of us again.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not sure to be honest during the night, cat is definitely responsible for the morning though :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Oh no, why was it rough?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Unpopular idea. Should the cat sleep outside?\\
I’ll run and hide now.\\Clearly you were just too excited for this evening that you didn’t sleep properly. Like a kid at Christmas.\\Chance for a nap?\\The guy is just a bit odd and you have to really concentrate to hear what he’s on about and it changes. He isn’t very chill.\\More seriously. We can cancel tonight if you need.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Actually! Research says they need a sleep buddy. I don't bring him in, he usually falls asleep on the sofa and then comes to cuddle up.\\
Haha, of course!\\No, don't want to cancel tonight. Hopefully will manage a little nap when I get back from the Slovak shop.\\What's your plan for today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Cats might need a sleep friend but I think humans sleep better in a bed on their own. The micro disturbances aren’t the best. That’s isn’t an excuse to get a second cat. :grinning-face:\\
Another rock and roll day. Will see how far I can get on this assignment. Might be a small amount of tidying to do because this cute girl I like is coming over and I need to prep dinner after lunch so it’s in the oven for when we want it.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I love sleeping with him :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: he's like an extra little heated weighted blanket.\\
If I had a bigger flat he'd definitely already have a sibling :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\Good luck with the assignment!\\Ooh who is she? She sounds brilliant!\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Crazy cat lady in the making :face-with-tears-of-joy:.\\
Oh, just some girl from my running club who other people have seemed to overlook how amazing she is.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: In the making??\\
Oh don't worry, no one overlooks it :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: One cat doesn’t quite make a crazy cat lady.\\
Oh, so your saying they just weren’t able to copy with the amazingness\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's exactly it!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Psychopaths !\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s like the realisation that people don’t have a voice in their head or can see images in there head.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yea, there was a thread about them on Reddit\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Would it be alright if I aim to get to you for 4.30? Sorry\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: yeah, no problem. I'm sure you can make it up to me.\\
Random brain thought. Do any of your doctors appointments on Thursday clash with your session with Steph. Weird thought I had\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm sure I can.\\
Haha, no. I'm quite good at scheduling :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Leaving x\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: So sorry for the quick exit but I am just not okay :pensive-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Glad you got home. Don’t be sorry. You did not look well. So glad you’re in your safe space.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: One of these days I will be okay when you see me :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And on that day. It will be my turn to be sick :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No no, you are the stable one in this :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No pressure on me then.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Absolutely none. I'll make you a cup of tea if you're ill, don't worry\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good to know.\\
Well, we can try again on Friday.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We definitely will!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did we have a time for Friday?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We didn't. What are we thinking?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Would 5 be okay?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: 5 works for me. Do you want me to bring anything? I could bring pudding this time.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no don't worry! Need to figure out what to make for food though\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Dry plain crackers and tepid tapwater :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00002828-GIF-2023-12-13-08-29-42.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning! Sleep was. Bit weird but definitely feeling better.\\
How are you? Did you sleep well?x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Better is good but sorry you’re still feeling a bit weird. Could try curry or stir fry next time. That actually has visible vegetables in it.\\
I seem to have had a suspicion amount of sleep and I’m hoping it’s due to the lie in and not the fact that I tidied my room yesterday.\\Otherwise all good.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly I don't know what it was, but it took me out completely and fast.\\
What am I making on Friday? And sorry already for having to eat it on the couch :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\Hahah, it's definitely the latter. There's research.\\What's the plan for today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have absolutely no idea what you’re making on Friday :grinning-face: you know what I don’t like.\\
Already know I’m eating it on the couch so I’m assuming it won’t be a full on knife and fork thing. Maybe dinner that uses a spoon.\\Simple plan today. Get this assignment finished. Maybe order at least some Christmas presents. Got a meet up this evening with the back space group I sort of joined. Not quite what I expected the group to be like but sometime something interesting happens.\\What time are you seeing your friends? Anything else going on?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well I was hoping for help with suggestions :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Maybe I'll do the Greek Mac and cheese with a back up if you don't like it.\\Good luck with the assignment! Hope it all goes well.\\Oh what's the group about? I don't think you've mentioned it before.\\I'm seeing Becky at 11 and then Patri after she finishes work. That's about it for me today - apparently I don't know how to relax\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And dealing with million calls and text from back home :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I was so helpful with suggestions. I suggested food you can eat with a spoon :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Mac and cheese is good. Hard to see how pasta and cheese could go wrong.\\The group is meant to be a “hack space” basically nerds meeting up to talk about projects. Just doesn’t have a defined agenda or that many people. I go because Duncan from my micromouse group goes and it’s a chance to learn something.\\I had very much noticed that. You don’t seem to be relaxing that much. You did say you were going to this week… but seeing friends should be relaxing.\\Oh dear. More tech support or is something wrong?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: So very helpful!\\
Well it's not your typical Mac and cheese...\\Ah sounds interesting!\\I know I did. But relaxing for me would be not going anywhere :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\Noooo. It's my name day!\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Im always helpful. Just not always in an obvious way.\\
Oh it has green in it!\\Probably too late but can you get your friends to come to you? You don’t have to go anywhere Friday?\\Oh yes. I thought that was next week even though you told me the day. So isn’t that a good thing to get messages from home?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Although if people are just messaging you to call you a witch that seems mean.\\
I did see something interesting about witches from back in the day. A theory if you like. Women were assumed to be witches because single women were more likely to own cat(s). Cats catch and kill mice and rats. Nice and rats spread disease. So these women didn’t catch the plague or get sick as often as everyone else. So the town would think they are a witch using magic to protect themselves. That’s why we still link cats to witches.\\All sounds quite obvious once someone pointed it out but I thought it was cool.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It does have green in it :face-with-tears-of-joy: but I don't think you can really taste it.\\
I'm going for a walk with Becky and the pooches but might ask Patri to come here. I wanted to go to the Slovak shop but might leave it for next week.\\Yeah it's nice but it's just a lot.\\It is very cool. These women also tended to be herbalists and thus cure ailments. And how dare women be single and intelligent. Burn them :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Urgh, intelligent women. Nightmare :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I saw a similar theory as to why Christian religions started to hate or fight against Muslims or Hindus. Similar idea to the witches. The not Christian religions (I forget which one) have the daily or multiple times a day act of washing hands and feet. So they wash off germs. Don’t get sick. But Christian people were getting sick. Just be because they were putting a hex on them.\\
Obviously nothing to do with washing and being clean. :man-facepalming:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: These dirty dirty Catholics :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's Muslims who wash hands and feet for prayer :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s it. Wasn’t sure if other religions did it as well.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good plan on saving the Slovak shop. Do they let you order online?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, no! That kinda stuff doesn't fly\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: If it would help with the relaxing maybe we can use that as an errand date? I could drive.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I really wanna go though. Need some comfort bits\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aw that's sweet. But I do actually like the drive, it's not that. I just don't want to put too many things in for the day and it does take about 2.5-3hrs\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We have an errand day on Saturday :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: I will cry if there's no parking :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well I can drive on Saturday if you like. Take the pressure off.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: As it will be shot given second Saturday before Xmas\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Shit not shot\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'd really appreciate that. Thank you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Option is there if you’d like. Rather than an evening date etc.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Another idea I had that might be scary. Given our plans for Friday and Saturday. How would you feel about me staying over Friday night? Assuming you don’t poison me this time.\\
We can go to Parkrun in the morning. I’d need to get to my house after to shower etc.\\just a thought.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm not leaving you on read, just need to drive. Will be back in a min\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Who’s overthinking now :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's why I said I'm not leaving you on read :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I really want to say yes to a sleepover. But given how badly I have been sleeping in recent weeks I'm a bit  apprehensive. Could we maybe do it on Tuesday next week when neither of us has an early morning after?\\
I'm sorry I'm weird <This message was edited>\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah you are weird :face-with-tears-of-joy: I like it. That sounds like a good plan and better than my idea. Does mean I won't be able to use the poor excuse of being tired from sex as the reason for a crap park run time.\\
I did ask with the option of you saying no. It wasn't a demand.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know it wasn't a demand, but I do feel bad for saying not yet.\\
I mean you can still use that excuse :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: not yet isn't no and I know it is a big step. I'm worried about being attacked by the furry overload at 3am plus you have a small bed.\\
I mean I could use it as an excuse but I think I'd get some very questionable looks.\\"Wow, all that sex this morning really tired me out and messed up my time"\\"Oh, were you with Lucy this morning"\\"No"\\":eyes::eyes::eyes::eyes:"\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: also as an FYI. I would not be discussing my sex life with Park Run people or really people in general.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'd hope not :face-with-tears-of-joy: don't need Stuart knowing anything\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How big is your bed?\\
And the furry overlord doesn't attack really, might just walk over you and sing you the song of his people\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Mines a king.\\
“Doesn’t attack really” that’s comforting :face-with-tears-of-joy:. I’ll either be dead to the world or he will scare the crap out of me. I guess we will see.\\The dogs used to sleep in the garage but a few times when I would fall asleep on the sofa. Clearly I would snore as Shadow would then bash me in the face with his giant nose\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: In the garage??\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: In my old house yeah. There was a whole area I built for them.\\
In my house now they just slept in the lounge. One of the reasons the lounge doesn’t have a lot of stuff\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I love animal cuddles in bed :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I could fit in there real well :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s a king size bed as well.\\
You had to earn hugs with Shadow and he would get hot so would never be on the bed very long. He’d try and get under it in fireworks and would jump on you but then quickly bugger off to pretend he was a lone wolf and didn’t need no one\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We me and Shadow would have gotten on so well!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Right, assignment done :face-with-head-bandage:. That's all taken a lot longer than I wanted but should be good practice for the exam. Will sit on it till tomorrow and submit in the morning.\\
Hope you had a good dog walk\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah well done!\\
It's done now so you can relax. When is your space group?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hacker group is at 7:30. Not entirely sure I can be bothered but will go up and see what happening. Can always leave early.\\
Hope your afternoon has gone well. Are you feeling any better?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yes, sorry! Hacker group.\\
How long does it usually lasts?\\It's been a lovely day but I am shattered\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Normally a couple of hours. It sometimes motivates me to work on the my mouse but brain is not up for that today.\\
Glad you had a good day.\\You need to work on this relaxing business. Another bath?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You need a brain relax.\\
I really do. Maybe a bath tomorrow after the PT session\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You could always have 2 baths. You know, live that rock and roll life.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah, I could. But honestly kinda don't fancy one tonight :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Can’t argue with that logic :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: One of those evenings :woman-shrugging-light-skin-tone:\\
Enjoy the hacker group\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Guessing you might be asleep already. Just got back. Somewhat interesting evening, always a weird array of chats. New sensor design for the robot, discussion about trapezoidal acceleration curves, programming Christmas lights, a knitting machine made an appearance and password security.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So I’ll wish you good night.\\
Night. x.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, I'm not! Yet.\\
That sounds like an interesting evening. Did you have a good time?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah it was ok. Half the people aren’t “socially aware” so there is a lot of cross talk or talking over each other. The room can get weirdly loud. Really I’m not sure it’s worth the £6 but then that cheaper than 2 pints.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not yet in bed?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh you pay a subscription?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am, just finishing up a chapter of audiobook and has to start a new hat .. 4 to go\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No just pay per visit\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Where are you visiting?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, 4’s  not that many left. Is that including the one your on.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s up the Asda in Wycombe.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: There’s a community centre and they rent a room\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup. 3 and 3\/4 left\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aaaah okay\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Audiobook - I’d guess murder or filth\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Book club one\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But murder yes\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not a bad guess then\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I mean it's not that hard with me :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Right, chapter finished so will turn in\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night, sleep well x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It would be a safe bet with most\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night.x.\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning!\\
Yes, slept a bit better last night but it took me ages to drift off too.\\How was spin?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you recovered from me poisoning you?\\
Spin was ok. Good turn out, 8 of us I think. Much better than the private class I ended up having last week.\\Then went and had a tea at my friend Toria’s house to see the progress they have made since a moving in. Much better but a daunting amount of work to do.\\How’s your day looking? PT and double doctor? Followed by a lot of sitting.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Tummy is still a bit fragile to be honest.\\
Oh that's a good number! Glad it was good.\\I've had one appointment already, then went to Agi for a doggy walk (I am covered in mud and have soggy feet), will pick up some bread and go home. Then another app at 2, another at 4 and then PT\\What's your plan?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Blimey your busy today. Didn't realise you had 3 appointments.\\
I'm hoping the ground dries up a bit more before Saturday.\\Sorry your still not feeling great from Tuesday. I might start blaming the fruit from the mulled wine:grinning-face:.\\Just had the parents come over for a drink. About to try and sort out some Christmas stuff before lunch. Got to squeeze in some uni work and then meeting an old school friend for a drink just after 5.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah turned out busy busy. I was only expecting 2 apps but the morning one said they'd call for another one at 4 :woman-shrugging-light-skin-tone:\\
I really hope it's not soggy on Saturday, hate wet feet. I think I'm going to treat myself to some proper hiking boots in January sales for bday.\\I blame my body rather than anything in particular.\\Aw cute. It is nice how close you are\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You can tell me how they all go tomorrow (if  you want to).\\
It shouldn't rain now but lets see, I dont want to be swimming around some of the course :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\Boots are a good idea. I've been wanting a set a good walking \/ hiking boats for ages. Could be dangerous but we could try and find them together.\\Cute is probably the right word. It is nice. Sometimes it can go 2 weeks without us seeing each other but my mum gets a bit twitchy in that case. Does keep my weekend free.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yeah we could. Definitely want to try them out properly\\
I haven't been back in over 18months. Definitely a different dynamic\\How is the uni work going? Any more assignments due?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Uni is ok. Assignment has been submitted. So that’s done now. Not got another one until middle of Jan. the lack of sleep is not helping with more uni stuff.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh boo. I'd suggest a nap but we know how you do with those :face-with-tears-of-joy: so what is left from uni stuff before you sign off for Xmas?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m tempted to try one. Watching a cosmology lecture on YourTube which may tip me over the edge on a nap.\\
I’ve got 3 chapters of cosmology to get through before Christmas \/ start of next year and some practice data analysis on astrophysics.\\What I need to do is check ahead to the next assignment and focus on that.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ooh make a list!\\
I love lists\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh don’t worry. If you want to be fully turned on. I even have lists of lists.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Very very turned on\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Silly spud.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's like the third time ever he's been in it since I bought it :face-with-rolling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: He looks guilty and annoyed in it. Like he just dug out a plant to sit in it.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That why he looked annoyed. You weren’t sat on the sofa.\\
You don’t have to go out for your appointment then?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not for the 4 pm\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: God knows how the PT will go I am exhausted\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sometimes that helps. You can’t think too hard about what you have to do.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you eaten properly? PT is a nightmare on low fuel\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I haven't\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But did have eggs for lunch\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: During lockdown when it was PT in the park I forgot to eat before a session. Was almost in tears. I’ve experimented with different levels of eating (obviously) before workouts and none in the worst. Too much food is a very close second.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Should I call you out on this?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What’s the \#1 rule ……\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: ?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Taking care of yourself\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yes\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I really fancy a burger\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What did you say you were also going to do this week?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Burgers are always good\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know. And once again, so shit about it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Next week. You did tell me to call you out on that as well.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s not the best but time for a cheeky Donald’s burger before PT?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I need at least one day next week when I don't leave the flat\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: MONDAY\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And or Tuesday\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no! I wouldn't digest that in time\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: On the way back then\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: One of those two days is Slovak shop!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Or you could go full filth and go up to 5 guys it might also need to leave the flat keys there as payment\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I do have burgers in the freezer\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sunday for not leaving the flat then.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ooooooh five guuuuys\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sunday is Christmas with the girls\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :man-facepalming:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Going to Agi's for Xmas films etc\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So Tuesday for not leaving and Monday for only going to the shop\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Wednesday can be a home day as well.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And job apps at some point\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s inside so that’s ok\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: If it all goes wrong I’ll just tie you to bed for Wednesday\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Always helpful me.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Always\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But honestly, you are. And I appreciate it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thanks. It’s all just logic to me.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And somewhat selfish, I kinda like that Wednesday idea.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, of course you do\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know there was a reason but you cannot do the Slovak shop tomorrow? Terrible day to travel and obviously you’re seeing me.\\
Maybe Monday is just better now I’ve typed it\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah those are the reasons I'd want to Monday\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Omg... Just had an idea! If I can get too good to go sushi for tomorrow would that be cool?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That would be good.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :beaming-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Can't guarantee what's going to be in there though!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I guess we will find out.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Surprise!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Surprise - it’s lettuce :leafy-green:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah. There will definitely be some crunchy bits I guess\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Will just have to see\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I always love it when I get some so hopefully you will too\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Appointment done or they never phoned back? Steph and 5?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Appointment done, starting calls next week. Steph at 5.30\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s always good to “get some”\\
Sorry, too obvious a joke to pass.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I was aware of that :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh, so you set me up for it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :woman-shrugging-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: DRUGS\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you\\
But after Steph :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Done\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope you're having a nice evening with your friend\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thanks, just got home. It was about what I expected. I can tell you about him tomorrow if you like. He might be my oldest friend. Someone that needs a therapist more than most and whose actions don’t match what he says he wants.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You in the bath?\\
How was the session with Steph?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that sounds interesting. Yes, tell me tomorrow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No making that burger! Had to run out for buns :face-with-rolling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It was haaaaaard. Three different heavy versions of squats. Will be a miracle if I can walk tomorrow\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Didn’t you already buy bread as well today?\\
Ouch, I think I’ve got squats tomorrow as I didn’t last week.\\If you let me know before 7:30 I can always complain to Steph for you.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That was bread! Not burger buns. At any given time I have at least 3 different types of bread things in my house :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I might have to add burgers to my shopping now.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, I always have some in the freezer\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I really need to sort my freezer out :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, super fun adulting. I’ve been trying to go through mine for the last 2 months.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: There's definitely things in mine I no longer eat\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Chuck it.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Dig deep\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Will have to. Even though I hate doing that\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Unless you know someone you can give it to (the food) it’s just easier to chuck\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't think I do. But it's meat and that's pricey\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Meat you say….\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: My favourite\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha you're welcome to it if you want\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: There's definitely beef and pork and bacon <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Beef yes. Not a huge fan of pork.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll have a look and let you know :slightly-smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Don’t worry about it for today.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh definitely not today :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good. You only need to dinner and relax.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Dinner is plated. Will eat now\\
Did you have dinner?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just having it now. While finishing off a cosmology lecture\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What are you having?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Poisoned beef :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Enjoy! It is yummy\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm watching Million Dollar Buffet with Grace Dent on Netflix and omg all of this needs to go on a list to try. Salivating here\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Danger watching food programs.\\
You having a bath?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Noooooo\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No idea what the name was but there was a good chocolate “cooking” show on Netflix where they make sculptures out of chocolate.\\
A bit like the glass blowing show\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think I've seen an ad for that\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It very impressive.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: \url{https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGeLsNR84/}\\
Good questions for some time?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: \url{https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGeLs8Bgy/}\\
Oh an apparently I discovered my attachment style :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep, playing the video through the browser is a pain but yes to questions. That other card game I order will be delayed as they sent me completely the wrong order.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well that’s good to know and does explain some stuff.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I thought so too\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s all about knowing.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll add it to my research list.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: In bed yet?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just about to. Was playing some games.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm already in\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll say night night now. Sleep well x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night. x.\\
\section*{Friday $15\textsuperscript{th}$}
Hope you have a better night as well and aren’t completely broken in the morning\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Morning. Hope you still sleep for a while longer. Unless the fur bag is being annoying.\\
I’ve managed to wake up with a headache, so that’s fun.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00003049-GIF-2023-12-15-06-47-55.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning!\\
Oh that's rubbish. Hope it passes soon. Enjoy the PT session x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Already! Wow.\\
That session was rough. Think I have some plague, which I could very much do without.\\How you feeling today?\\Steph was very complimentary about how strong you are. I said she ruined you yesterday.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: \url{https://www.prezzybox.com/scratch-poster-kama-sutra.aspx?utm-source=facebook&utm-medium=cpc&utm-campaign=ASC-Paid-Always+On-UK-TSS-Prezzybox-Meta-Catalogue+Sales-Highest+Volume-NEW&utm-content=Broad+Audiences-Open-UK-18%2B-Both-Auto-ASC&Ad+Name=Catalogue-Product+Catalogue-Client+Creative+Team-All+Products-N%2FA-Long+Form-Promote-Product+Name-Price-Home+Page-24%2F10%2F23&Placement=Facebook-Mobile-Feed&utm-id=6491261910572&utm-term=6491261910172&fbclid=IwAR19uR9x4B4AgvLK67pr0ao-GKCnG-3qZ-Fh6kIV0oxA6yQKHd7NstkK4TY-aem-AeE4wVro20wF9ZvzlK-AyauaXIsN-8635-UoWntsJJcJ4cLt7s-JUCBUrWbxPfUgsou207DyU-DPXKCHcBjv--rb}\\
For your hall way :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no. Are you not feeling well?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I seem to be coming down with something. No doubt from my party on Saturday. At the moment its just a headache some fog and a little cough.\\
I really don't want to make you sick\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no!\\
Would you like to postpone tonight? I'd rather you get yourself better. Do you have any lemsip etc?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I'm not sure I can accurately describe how much I dont want to postpone tonight but I do wonder if it is the more sensible idea. I really don't want you to get sick.\\
I have some flu plus drugs\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think I get it :winking-face: but if you stay home today and properly take care of yourself, and miss parkrun you might feel better tomorrow evening?\\
I really can't get sick, I will be really unwell for a long time.\\I can bring you some soup (and not stay)?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Do you have honey, lemon and ginger at home?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I was already going to miss parkrun as cardio with a cough is pure pain and Hannah said it was a good idea. Mean's I am yet to run this month.\\
I guess postponing to Tuesday is the adult sensible plan and I really dont want to be the reason you get sick.\\Thanks for the other of soup but that would probably be enough for you to get sick.\\This is all probably because I was looking for some sort of excuse to pass up on tomorrow night.\\Honey yes,\\Lemon juice like you have seen\\Ginger - technically- its a jar of crushed\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well I'm going for a walk with Katie at lunch. I'll stop in the shop after and get you the bits. Soup is already packed. I'll just put it in between your doors and wave at you from outside?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm sorry you're feeling crap but hopefully you can kick it with the drugs and my eastern European nonsense :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am really hoping your heating is on, and you are either in bed or on the couch under blanket with tea\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: oh that will be nice (the walk).\\
Thank you. that would work although I might be in the bath.\\I'm equally enraged at being sick. I am not a fan and I dont do well at being sick.\\Heating is on and will have a bath\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's okay. I'll just pop it in there and if you are I'll text you.\\
Slice of ginger, slice of lemon, tea spoon of honey and boiling water - drink crap load of it in the next two days.\\Do you have Vicks or anything like that?\\As you know I'm not a great ill person neither so I get that.\\Wish I could take better care of you in person. Just know I'm sending you all the feel better vibes\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: No Vicks. I'm not a fan.\\
I guess no one is great at being sick but I don't like relying on people.\\I know you'd try and take of me but I am not a good patient. So this is the best result\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Relying on people, eh? Sounds familiar!\\
Do you need anything else from the shop?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I'm probably going to be another 1.5-2hrs so I'll let you know\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think it’s more of feeling a burden but then that a whole bit of a rabbit hole that therapy was good for. Fortunately I don’t get sick very often. Might have something to do with the crazy hand washing.\\
Thanks but don’t need anything from the shops.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well you're not a burden x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I should be out of the bath by then :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Enjoy the walk.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How is bath? Just popping to the shops and then on my way\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s not made anything worse, so that’s a plus. I had hoped it would help the headache as I saw a trick that putting you feet in hot water would help.\\
How was the walk?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Walk was lovely. Only a short one but good to get out. Will be by your door in about 10 :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok, just got out of the shower\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thank you for the supplies. That’s really nice.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Needs to be drunk hot :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You're so very welcome. Don't ever think about being a burden. I like doing it. Let me know if you need anything xx\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s part of what I learned. People like helping and denying them the chance to help can upset people. So the short version is to ask for help.\\
Now that your evening has gone wide open what’s the plan?\\Drug bath, nap, hats\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, that's pretty much it.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: <attached: 00003094-AUDIO-2023-12-15-14-32-16.opus>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Patience? How so?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s crap. I’m not sure I remember you telling me but that is a real pain.\\
Hopefully you can find something on Monday.\\You bake? What makes Slovak cookies different?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I went and did it again. Setting myself up.\\
In the sense that external things keep delaying us spending time together. So I’m having to be patient.\\I might have said before. One of the frustrating things my therapist told me about learning how to be patient is to have patience.\\A very infuriating statement but cannot actually argue with it.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They are proper traditional stuff. I was so excited :confused-face:\\
Of course I bake. Just not often because I don't eat it :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah but external factors are always going to be there, it's just how we deal with it :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You can't help getting ill. Same way as I can't help not feeling well either\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :frowning-face: can you reorder and have it for next week or after Christmas.\\
And I don’t bake because I will eat it :grinning-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No she's not doing any more orders :pensive-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Completely agree. Was just a thought in that it’s making me be more patient\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, that is a shame.\\
Hopefully you can get something from the shop on Monday.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That lemon ginger stuff isn’t bad. First jug done.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Me too. Now definitely need to make sure I get there on Mon\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Was it still hot?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah still hot.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The soup was awesome btw. Like you.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okay okay\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I'm glad you liked it. One of my favourites, make it every other week\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not a complaint but it could be more spicy :hot-pepper:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's different levels every time :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have that with something I make. One chilli is pain and sometimes 2 chilli’s is nothing\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Right, what's your plan for the afternoon?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sitting.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And hydration\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: In a blanket?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I do have a blanket yet\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What’s your plan?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Rest and fluids please. No pottering around\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Brain is not going to allow pottering.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Rest I think\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Where did you learn the word pottering from? That is a quintessential. British word.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't know, I always use it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Very good plan. Only took you all week :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I have been here for close to 17 years\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: A theory I have about why English speakers who weren’t born here sometimes struggle to understand what the hell British people are saying is based on some very old British only TV shows. Shows that probably aren’t shown any more and would never have been shown in other countries.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So it’s just interesting to me how people pick up words.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I haven't come across non native speakers who've lived here for a moment that don't understand what British people are saying tbh\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Maybe it’s just Americans then. At EY I’d be saying something and a lot of American people would ask wtf I was talking about.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's highly probable\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How are you feeling?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: About the same. Thought I might be doing a bit better but have felt dizzy while making dinner.\\
Bored of the tv already.\\Definitely the right choice to postpone but I am gutted to not be spending time with you. I think we’d have had a lot of fun.\\How are you feeling?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no for the dizzy. Please be careful . Have you managed to eat enough?\\
Of course we would have. We always have fun on dates :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\I'm okay. Just tired\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh I’ve eaten. It’s real bad if I stop eating. I think I get that from my dad. He seems to get mega hungry when sick.\\
:winking-face:\\Hopefully you got a chance to relax a bit\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah good. Glad you've eaten.\\
What are you up to now?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just watching tv. Switching between rules of engagements and YouTube. Did start the first episode of Reacher but that is a “pay attention” show.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Any brain power for reading? Might help with boredom\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not really although I’ll try tomorrow. Will see if I can make some more progress in the attachment book.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okay. A good night's sleep will definitely help. Are you taking drugs?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I mean I’ve run out of ketamine :grinning-face:but have been taking flu drugs. Still not cleared the headache\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have you been drinking enough?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Am I overbearing yet?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, it’s a struggle but drinking loads. 2 jugs of the lemon ginger.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Please tell me when I am\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I just worry about you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Aww :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It has been a long time since I’ve been in bed this early.\\
You still planning on doing park run tomorrow?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I'm going to walk it. But will skip Marlow. I don't think I can deal with the crowds (and tacos are not going to be there).\\
I'm just about to get into bed too\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: On the plus side for me I’m not missing out on tacos again.\\
I’m hoping I might still be asleep when park run starts but I doubt it.\\No doubt Marlow and everywhere will be crazy busy tomorrow.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We'll go in between Christmas and NY if they are there :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
I hope you sleep well and feel better tomorrow.\\Night night xx\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah we can go before I head off to centre parcs\\
Night. x.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh when is that?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: 30th to the 5th but I won’t be staying that long. Thinking I’ll do Saturday to Wednesday.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah nice!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also are you free boxing day? Katie was asking if you wanted to go for a walk with us if Lee comes with?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah I’m free.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And would you like to come?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Twas going to be one of the many conversations I’d planned for tonight.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yes please\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What was?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Christmas, timings, availability etc\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aaah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We could have had a call :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That would have been an idea. My voice has gone a bit though. Can wait til Tuesday\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh sweets. Do you have a sore throat?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Boooo\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Voice was cracking at the gym this\\
Morning\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Throat isn’t terrible\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sending a big massive hug\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Me too. Missed the hugs this week.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah, there weren't enough on Tuesday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: There was not. Being poisoned will do that.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hshahs\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: As I said maybe I’ll try a stir fry next time time\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Or pasta\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I made the Greek Mac and cheese tonight if you'd like some dropped off tomorrow?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah I’d like to try that. I still have some soup but I’m 90\% I won’t be going out tomorrow night.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki, I'll stop by after pr :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Great.\\
I’ll say night again and try to get some sleep without thinking too hard about you laying in bed.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't think about it *too* hard about it :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night x\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: Morning. Hope you slept well. I think I had a suspicious amount again.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning! You needed the sleep :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
How are you feeling?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Definitely did. Feeling about the same. Headache is still here :man-facepalming: throats a little worse.\\
How about you?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh boo. Hopefully today is the break day and you start feeling better tomorrow.\\
I'm okay. Woke up with a headache too and really questioning whether I want to go PR\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I hope so but the plan today is to do nothing. Just need to get some drugs from downstairs and then back to bed. I might have a bit more energy today to think about you too much.\\
Well as I’m not there… I haven’t even looked outside to see what’s it’s like. If you don’t go could you do a walk with someone so you at least get outside or do half a lap. Walk the start all the way to the car?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That is a good plan. Do you have Spotify premium? They are doing audiobooks now so if you can't read you could listen to something.\\
Well I'll come wave at you from outside :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\I really don't want to see to many people today but hey ho. I'm going to go and then have a nap when I get back\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Don’t have Spotify, I you YouTube instead. My audible has loads of books I need to start. So I might continue the book on that.\\
Don’t go if you don’t want or if it’s going to be overwhelming. But a nap after is a good idea.\\I’ll blame being sick but I am not good at trying to send suggestive or spicy :hot-pepper: messages. I was very subtly angling for a picture.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: A picture????\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Photo\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Of you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Of meee? <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll hide now\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Of course of you and I already have the stunning ones of you in the dress\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, I hate pics of myself :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't think I'm going. You're a bad influence :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
But I still need to go to post office and pick up some bits for tomorrow\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think a lot of people do. Of themselves not you.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Will text when I'm on my way to drop off bits at yours\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What! Is was just logic\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Post office to buy or pick up something they could deliver\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: To post secret Santa\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh, a whole thing I don’t know about\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Nice deflection btw, so I’m not about to get a pic you in your underwear\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hides again.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm already dressed\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Convenient\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm efficient\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hmm :thinking-face: I’ll just make do with what I have then\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You'll see me in all my wrapped up, leisure wear glory in a bit\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How longs a bit likely to be as I’m still in bed?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: An hour or so. But don't worry of you are, I'll just drop it at the door\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Depending on the leisure wear, some of it is very nice\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll at least make sure to unlock the white door\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okie doke\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: As I’ve somewhat fallen down the rabbit hole. Do you like the suggestive texts and the idea that I might be touching myself to thoughts \/ pictures of you?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, a bit early for this :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
But yes, I'm fine with that\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Early in the day or the relationship?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: In the day :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh good. When in the day would better just out of interest?\\
This is what happens when I get bored and can’t do things. Brain goes all over the place.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: When I'm slightly more awake :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh, so after lunch :face-with-tears-of-joy: as that isn’t the evening time :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Btw do you need anything while I'm in town?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What shop you going to?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Post office but can pop in anywhere\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And I'm parked in Morrisons\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Don’t want to put you out and I don’t really think I need anything.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Morrisons to go to the post office? Isn’t that all the way across town\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You wouldn't be putting me out. What would you like?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nah, 5 mins\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Some more skyr yogurt or low \/ no fat Greek yogurt would be good. Morrisons don’t do good donuts but maybe some cookies. Oh, and some more flu drugs as I will run out before I get refilled on Monday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thank you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Any flavour of skyr?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What kind of donuts?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Plain skyr\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Morrisons don’t do good ones so don’t worry. It’s not like I need to eat donuts\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm in town, doesn't need to be Morrison\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: WHAT FLAVOUR DONUTS? :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Still valid. I don’t need donuts.\\
Now who’s the bad influence.\\The one from yesterday is good or Lidl also do a hazelnut filled one\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm probably going to pop to tesco\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How many yoghurts popette?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Assuming they are the big 400+ ml ones go with 4\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s the ones\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Either are great but go with the first\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: On my way back to the car so will be 10-15mins\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Great\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You could let yourself in if you like?\\
Press a flat palm against the black keypad to turn it on.\\Code 258369 then press * (bottom left) it will beep then turn handle.\\Don’t judge my kitchen, I’m sick.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha ok. Hopefully won't catch any of your germs :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I hope not or leave in the porch. I’ll come down and say hello through the glass\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll come in\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: As long as you don’t go around licking the kitchen I’d hope you be ok\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But will only do air kisses :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Understandable\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Cabnet in my hallway. Draw on the right might even have a face mask\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Also don’t judge the boxes. Haven’t been able to move yet\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm here\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I heard\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll put the yoghurts in the fridge\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Cookie or a donut?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thank you for picking up all the stuff for me. Your amazing.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You're welcome :smiling-face-with-open-hands:\\
Now hurry up and get better x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, I’m trying\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You make really good tea as well. Are you just good at everything\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Definitely not\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But I'm glad you like it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you get everything sorted that you needed to in town?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I just needed the post office really\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What’s the secret Santa for or who\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Murder mates secret Santa :Santa-Claus:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Of course. Should have guessed really\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s a cool thing to do though\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah, the one for me is under the tree already\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Nice, was there a theme or just a spending limit\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just spending limit\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What do I owe you for the stuff? I can transfer it.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It was 6 for the drugs and I think just under a tenner in tesco\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We can sort it out later, when you see me\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So £16\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I can transfer. It not like I have a lot to do :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha ok\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: PayPal?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Can do. Is bank details too much :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Although PayPal might be slightly easier\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: lucia.endrodyova@gmail.com\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Got it x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good. That Is faster than a BT.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It is\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What are your plans now for the rest of the day?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just making breakfast and then nap. And then need to tidy up and then relax\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You? :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Your done with outside for today then? Sounds like a good plan and yes you did need to relax.\\
RELAX damn it :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\Oh you know. Tearing it up as always. I’m about to venture down stairs so I’m closer to drinks. I’m not used to eating or drinking in bed\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Also had you worked out what day it is today? One month anniversary of our first date! Not how I would have hoped to spend it. Well the being in bed part yes but under different conditions :face-with-tears-of-joy:.\\
Just to say that I really like you, I think you’re amazing and I’m excited to see where this goes.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am done with outside for today definitely!\\
I will definitely try to relax.\\I don't ever eat in bed so get that. Make sure you have blankets downstairs :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I have worked it out :beaming-face-with-smiling-eyes: thought about it this morning - wasn't sure whether you did the montha-versasier.\\
I really like you too :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: and also excited to see where it goes x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah I have a blanket downstairs. Currently got a “nice“ hot flush going :man-facepalming:\\
You could have mentioned it first! I can’t say I ever have been a montha-versasier person and might forgot but I think 1,3,6 are significant.\\You (we) should celebrate the small things\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We should definitely celebrate the small things :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I was meaning to but just forgot when I got to yours. Fibro fog :woman-shrugging-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hmm, clever excuse. I’ll allow.\\
I always remember things to say afterwards anyway.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's not an excuse :face-with-tears-of-joy: that's my reality\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Excuse was the wrong work. Reason maybe.\\
I’m not sure what mine is. I even write down things to talk about and then even forget to look at the list.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Then just add to the list at some point later\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: My brain is just catching up.\\
Are you a montha-versasier person then?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've never been previously. But think the 1,3,6 could be :slightly-smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Same.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good. Then we'll do that\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: 3 and or 6 could tick off one of those eating places.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oooh yes :beaming-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: With you love for efficiency and your plan to take a nap…. That logically creates 2 opportunities for :camera:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahahahahahahah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't nap or sleep naked. At least 3 layers in the winter :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Damn it.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I didn’t think you’d sleep or nap naked but if your were going to bed would change. Thus the opportunity where your in underwear at some point during the transition\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Remember the efficiency... I've changed ages ago :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What! As you walked in the door?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well at some point in the next 24 hours you have to be wearing only underwear.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You really want a pic :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I do but also fear I’ve pushed too far.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Also, I’ve never asked anyone else for one. I don’t know if that says anything or not.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Also, you’re only the 4th person who currently has access to my house. The other 3 being my parents and brother. Just an overthink if you somehow thought I give that away to anyone.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm awake! Yay. Still have a headache, boo\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just let it come naturally\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Boo on the headache.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oooooh. Are you not worried I'll break in and go on a clearing spree :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Beak in no. Cleaning spree maybe.\\
More than I wanted you to know that I trust you with it. Which is rare for me\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I appreciate it :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Apparently having you feet in hot water is meant to help with a headache. Not sure how to actually do that without just ending up stood in your bath.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah you've mentioned that before. And also that you tried it and it didn't work :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ah, I was in the bath at the time so maybe it didn’t work because it wasn’t just the feet warming up.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Maybe\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm tackling the freezer. Do you eat turkey?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yes, technically.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's like turkey breast fillets?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah I’d eat those\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No bacon?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I eat it but I’ve bacon in the freezer from ages ago. Just don’t eat it regularly.\\
Streaky bacon I can make into carbona\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's medallions\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Best given to someone else\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What would be you cooking \/ reheat instructions for the mac and cheese and garlic bread?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Mac and cheese you can just bung a portion in the microwave\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Garlic bread 8 mins in the oven\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Around 2 mins and you could finish it off for 3 in the oven ( I usually don't)\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Please let me know what you think of it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: 180c?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeaaah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's the only temp I use :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Erm, is there more than one portion in that container?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: For me who struggles with eating yes. For a normal person, no\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well I’ll be trying to eat it on one.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh! No roast potatoes then. Not that I’ve made them this year.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: My oven only says 200 so I go with  close apprpximation\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did you eat?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah had lunch. Soup was still good. Pasta will be dinner\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Freezer, base boards and door frame tops all done?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah okay :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
I thought you ate it and it was so bad you didn't want to talk about it :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, no. I have no idea yet :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Freezer done, I only have things I actually like in there now\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Then hoovered and done some laundry\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And had dinner\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Because I am 80\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Dinner? In the afternoon :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Shhhhhhh\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Was it still light outside :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nope\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well that works then\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What have you been up to?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You planning on a 7pm bed time then.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh me, super busy. I made it down stairs. Managed to run the dishwasher and some washing up. Mainly sitting and watching tv. Can’t even say I’ve watched anything good. Starting to get a bit of restless leg so thinking about a bath\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: If you're feeling up to it a quick 10 min walk around the block might do you good\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: On the dark! Not a bad idea\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Fresh air is good\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well i did open a window\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I did :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I then opened the bathroom one as well\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha well done\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done. Plenty of time to get them done.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Given that your actually meant to be relaxing next week and not out and about everyday you have a good chance of getting them done\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well... That's the plan. On top of seeing you, Slovak shop, Xmas food shop , gym, and anything else :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did you go for a walk \/ bath?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Other than the Xmas food shop those activities are meant to be relaxing and not stressful.\\
Walk no. Too dark. Bath done. Just got out.  Now to risk your food :face-with-tears-of-joy:.\\All of sudden the day seems to have disappeared\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nothing risky about my food. Just your special palette :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I wouldn’t have said it was risky at all until you thought I’d stopped talking to you after eating it :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well I can't wait to hear your thoughts\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Pasta was good. I’ll admit I  did pick up the big chunks of spinach but it was nice. Thank you.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I really like you food containers as well. Which is a really sad grown up statement\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha. Why am I not surprised! But well done for trying it out anyway :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I like them too. I don't need to worry about all the plastic nonsense\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sleep well and I hope you feel better tomorrow. Night x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night. x. Sleep well.\\
\section*{Sunday $17\textsuperscript{th}$}
I think I’m feeling a bit better, so hoping tomorrow is better.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00003413-GIF-2023-12-17-08-21-52.mp4>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Morning x. How are you doing?\\
Are you out with the girls today?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning. How are you feeling?\\
I'm in the gym and seeing the girls later. Just cosy drinks, nibbles and Xmas films at Agi's\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done for hitting the gym. I’ve not done a Sunday gym session in ages.\\
I think I’m technically feeling better than I would if I’d have gone out last night but the sore throat has taken over as the main thing. Also slept terribly. I think the caffeine in the flu drugs broke me as must have been 1am before I fell asleep and was wide awake at 6 but got another 90 mins or so.\\That will make this afternoon boring and already means I should skip spin tomorrow.\\I do have to force myself outside today to drop something off for one of my art friends, so will see if I can grab some night time drugs.\\What are cosy drinks?\\Enjoy the gym. x.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well it's good that you didn't go last night then. Eat a spoonful of honey for the sore throat and keep drinking the ginger lemon honey concoction.\\
You should probably skip the spin (definitely).\\But it will be good for you to go for a walk. You need fresh air movement\\Having drinks while being cosy.. :beaming-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I will be skipping spin. A pain but want to try all I can to be best for Tuesday. I don’t think I’m going to have a normal week now until the end of January.\\
I’ll get moving in a minute and get some fresh air. It had best cure me if I’m going to leave the warmth :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\Oh, I thought it was going to be hot chocolate or mulled wine. Something like that. Not just drinking with a blanket.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, there will be mulled drinks :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Enjoy the walk x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It is surprisingly nice outside. Another thing for the list would be a simple walk from mine and coffee at the national trust place.\\
Managed to acquire night time drugs as well.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah glad you managed to get out. How are you feeling?\\
You know I love a good walk \/ hike.\\Yay for drugs. I could have gotten them for you yesterday :confused-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Think I’m feeling better or the drugs have kicked in. Throat is the most annoying now and the headache is much better.\\
One of the many things I miss about not owning a dog is the walk. Yes, you can go but a dog forced it. The woods behind me and Hughenden is so nice.\\I know you could have but I didn’t think to ask for night ones. I also didn’t think the day ones would keep me up that long either. Live and learn.\\What are you up to between gym and going out?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's good that you're feeling better.\\
Yeah they are, I've been on lots of walks round there\\Just pottering around, will get ready now.\\What have you been up to except the walk?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Pottering :grinning-face:\\
Your off out earlier than I thought. That’s good.\\All I’ve done is have lunch and watch TV.\\Need to shower at some point and I might try out some mindless gaming. Will also see about opening the offensive amount of Amazon boxes I have and check Christmas presents.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's Sunday. We're getting together on an afternoon of course :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
Oh yes, shower always helps me to feel better\\Haha yes, it's a lot of boxes. Are you going to be wrapping it all up? I'd offer to help but not sure when we'll be finishing up\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You say of course but the one and only time we went out on a Sunday was LATE. I don’t know how people do it.\\
Sleep, outside, food, shower in some sort of order to maximise feeling good.\\Yeah it all needs wrapping, which I am not great at and I think I’m missing stuff for someone. Just not sure who or what yet.\\Help would be great but I still don’t want you to get sick. On the plus side. No chance it will all get done today :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I can definitely help you wrap presents.\\
Are you still infectious?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have no idea if I’m still infectious. How do you find out? Not sure it worth the risk for wrapping presents.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: <attached: 00003431-GIF-2023-12-17-13-53-10.mp4>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Don’t take it the wrong way. I really want to see you.\\
Google was not helpful and it’s 50\/50 if I’m still infectious.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: There will still be presents to wrap later in the week\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've asked my nurse friend. 3 days from first symptoms\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Assuming you’ll want to see me in between Tuesday and Saturday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Today should 100\% be the last day then. Maybe they started on Thursday but definitely all went down hill Friday\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Booooo\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll be patient :face-with-rolling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Very much booo.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But like girl has needs\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Guessing you’ve woke up with some energy this morning\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, how was wrapping presents going to fix that\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You'd be unwrapping presents\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh I see\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Another time :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, you’ll have to make do with the draw or case or sex toys you have.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Right I'm off to see the girls. Enjoy your afternoon x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Enjoy. x.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know you’ll probably give me the eye roll emoji but it’s is very nice knowing you want me.\\
Hope you’ve had \/ having a nice afternoon\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh you know me so well :face-with-rolling-eyes::face-with-rolling-eyes::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just parked at home. It was really lovely. How's the rest of your day been?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: \url{https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGeNhFC7E/}\\
This incredibly nerdy thing is going on my 40 before 40 list\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Tick tock without the app is bad. Will look again on the pc. What am I missing as it looks like a ball with ballrooms dancing?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Download the app :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy: I send a lot of tiktoks\\
It's like a bookish nerdy ball in a castle\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m starting to.\\
Either, I’m not good at recognising it and or just not used to receiving it. So it’s really nice when it’s obvious.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Of course I do! Otherwise we wouldn't be together would we? I'll try to make it more obvious\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I would but the tictok T\&C are a bit terrifying. Plus I prefer my trending tick ticks to become treandint instagram reels 2 weeks later.\\
You know, like an old person :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well yes, I fully get the logic but there are still dumb bit of the brain.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Rest of the afternoon was ok. Bored myself watching TV then for bored playing a game. Which is good as that was impossible yesterday (the playing bit).\\
My mum phoned with some sad news. My brother is going to have to have his dog put down tomorrow.\\Not a surprise as she has been living on borrowed time. Just very sad and I think my brother made it a bit worse than it needed to be by warning the kids that it will happen tomorrow. They would be upset regardless. Will be quite rough for my brother.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I'm so sorry, that is absolutely horrendous. Sending hugs to all of them\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Maybe he didn't. At least they can have a proper last night together. I can't even imagine it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-rolling-eyes::face-with-rolling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You know me well enough to know I know my own mind (most of the time). If I'm in, I'm in :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It certainly is the worst part of pet ownership and it isn’t any better when you know it coming. I knew both of mine were coming but when it came down to it both had to be decided on the day. Didn’t have to go to bed knowing it was tomorrow.\\
She is 12. So had a good run and was his workshop dog for over 10.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Again, see previous comment :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Then it starts to be a little of knowing vs assuming and assuming is dangerous. But being more obvious would help\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What are you assuming that's dangerous?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: At the moment nothing. It was more of a lessons learned from the last things.\\
Sort if a rule I have but not as serious as that. If you validate an assumption and everyone agrees then no harm done. If you assume something and it’s wrong then all sorts of things can start to go wrong.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think I get it... I guess\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How are you feeling?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Starting to feel a lot better. Throat is still sore and the odd sniffle but much better overall than yesterday.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I'm glad. I was starting to worry about you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Worry, in what way?\\
Odd question maybe.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That you were ill\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Because I care about you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, that’s nice :smiling-face:\\
My surprise is that I’ve only been sick a couple of days.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Suprise about me caring that you've been only ill a couple of days and I worry, or the actual duration of the illness?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m not surprised about you caring although that’s a nice new thing. Just not used to people worrying about me.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Get used to it :face-blowing-a-kiss:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I will try.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I had a thought\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Go on ....\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Depending how I feel in the morning. You could always drop by on your way to the Slovak shop.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You could see I was typing :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I did\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah we can see how we both are in the morning :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Both, are you ok?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just tired. Oversocialised as per\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh, if it isn’t the consequences of my own decision coming back to haunt me. :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What decisions?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Your decision to socialise leading to oversocialing\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I need time with my friends\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm just a tired grl\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah I know. It wasn’t a negative. Just the way things are when we do things we want to do and they then have consequences we don’t want.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's my life :woman-shrugging-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep, just sucks for you that you have to choose\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Maybe worked out best that you didn’t see me today then. Energy wise.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah that's been one of those hard things to get my head around\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Energy wise sure. But I would have liked to\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I would have liked to as well.\\
I’m guessing as you tired yourself out with your friends you haven’t sorted out any of the “needs” you were keen to have sorted earlier.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh haven't even thought about that since :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I was right then\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: About?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not cracking open you box of sex toys.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha yeah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And it's not a box\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just a humble drawer\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Crate? Wardrobe\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Maybe I’ll get to see on Tuesday how humble this draw is.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hmm maybe\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s not a no :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Is that our thing now :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Maybe. It’s been my thing for a while.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What would be more scary for you. Showing me your draw of sex toys or bank details :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They are not scary\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: All relatively vanilla\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well I was sort of assuming there wasn’t a blow torch in there. More that I was trying to compare the apprehension of showing be the draw vs sharing your bank account from yesterday.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Relatively! Ok.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't think there's anything I should be afraid of\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Or ashamed of\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Certainly wasn’t implying you should be ashamed of any of it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I know you weren't don't worry\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good, i can show you mine after you show me yours.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :eyes::eyes::eyes::eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Go on, tell me\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is not how this works\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I told you!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You told me you have a draw of sex toys\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Easily deducted what that means\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And I have a draw \/ box\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What's in it?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Relatively vanilla things :grinning-face:\\
Possibly the more interesting question is what you now think I might have.\\It’s better shown but just light bondage stuff and vibrators\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah ok\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well I'm sure I'll get a peek at some point\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: At least one funny thing is that a long time ago I tried to make some dog rope toys and was completely innocently googling away. To discover that the same rope they make dog toys out of is also bondage rope.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah shibari\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And then that yeah.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hopefully, if we can find the time for one of us to not be sick :man-facepalming:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That would be ideal\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It definitely a good starting point. No colds, flu or food poisoning. Then improve from there\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah yeah, that's a low bar\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Once we destroy this bar we can raise it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m in bed now so will wish you got night. x.\\
Let’s see what tomorrow brings\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good night. x. Even\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night, sleep well. Hope you feel back to usual tomorrow xx\\
\section*{Monday $18\textsuperscript{th}$}
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00003554-GIF-2023-12-18-08-00-48.mp4>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How are you feeling today?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning! Did you sleep well?! How are you feeling?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: A bit fuzzy. Didn't really sleep again. Will try for a nap before I need to leave I think\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Think I slept pretty well. Certainly feeling better. Still a bit of a headache and sore throat but all better than yesterday. Hopefully will get better as I start moving around.\\
Sorry you’re a bit fuzzy. Any reason for the bad sleep? Are you worrying about something.  Was the fur missile bouncing around the room.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh hope the headache clears. Btw, gargling salt water is really good for sore throat\\
Bad sleep is a fibro thing unfortunately. Just couldn't get to sleep for ages and then kept waking up. Furry overlord actually slept through the night and is still asleep, I think I was waking him up this time :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What's your plan for today?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, how the tables turn if you were keeping the cat up.\\
I have done the salt water thing in the past. It is awful. Been doing it with mouthwash as that has alcohol in it.\\Plan for the day. I’ve got shopping arriving sometime in the next hour. I’ve got a PT session at 5. I’ve got a ton of uni work to do but the brain isn’t at its best. Will try another lecture at least. Think about wrapping presents.\\Are you napping, shopping, nap relaxing?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh busy day for you!\\
Are you going to be alright for the PT session?\\Yup, that's pretty much my plan\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh and I've got a therapy call at 6!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :eyes::eyes:\\
I was looking at that as a slack day for me. I always think about doing too much.\\Should be fine for PT. There isn’t really a different time I can move it to and there shouldn’t be any cardio. Just picking up heavy things.\\Oh cool. Is this the first call with that new service you said about?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I have the same problem. I'm just looking at it in a way that if it were me today, it would wipe me out\\
Well hopefully you won't push yourself too hard back into being poorly.\\Yes, first one with a clinician. Will see how it goes. It's a 6 week thing and apparently they might be able to offer me a chronic illness support after too\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That could be very interesting if they are able to offer longer term support.\\
I’ll make a call on PT at lunch. I can time the drugs.\\I’m assuming there is no longer a plan for you to come over today? We stick with the plan for tomorrow.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: <attached: 00003567-GIF-2023-12-18-09-32-58.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You're not feeling great still and have loads of work and I'm all fuzzy and sleepy :confused-face:\\
It's probably most sensible that we bring our A game tomorrow instead.\\I'd love to see you but I'd probably just curl up under a blanket on your sofa\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not your fault. Just validating an assumption. It changes the priority to when I shower and tidy up.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Validating an assumption?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s my very cool corporate speak.\\
I’d assumed I wasn’t going to see you today based on our morning texts but I didn’t want to assume it without asking first.\\As previously said poorly. I’ve learned it is bad to make assumptions when it involves choices from other people.\\That why I checked with you.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I just don't know whether it's in a positive way or you're unhappy...\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think it’s a positive thing to confirm thoughts. As they cannot spiral then.\\
I’m not a big fan of the word happy for reasons we don’t need to get into.\\It’s just a shame we can’t meet up for very logical reasons.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okay, I'm just going to go with that you're not upset with me..my brain is too fuzzy to completely get what exactly is being talked about :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also... I'd like to revisit the 'happy' comment if you'd be up for it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll be clear.\\
I am not upset with you.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I am upset (not a word I would normal use) that I’m sick because I hate being sick.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: We can. It’s not a txt thing.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know what you mean. I get very frustrated ( and I need to work on that because *gestures around)\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki, put it on the list for tomorrow :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <sarcasm>Yay :raising-hands: <\\sarcasm> that’s really going to set the mood :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We can leave it to the end of the night\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But like obviously I'm intrigued!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No pressure but I’m hoping we are going to be doing stuff.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: * no pressure :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know and I set myself up to talk about it .\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You did\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The real trick will be if you remember.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: There is no going to be a post it note on the tv :man-facepalming:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You're counting on my fibro fog\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just general forgetfulness but now you’ve said that I’ll have to remember to bring it up.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think I have a totally made up scenario that might help explain my thinking around the assumptions thing.\\
Let’s pretend someone is asking me if we want to go to some sort of event in a few days times. I reply “No we can’t do that. Lucy isn’t interested in that sort of thing”\\but I never asked you or tell you about the event. Just assumed.\\If I’d have asked you you might have agreed that you didn’t want to go or you might have wanted etc. but I denied you the choice.\\This is a bit of an other top example but does that help at all? If not just ignore it.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll have to think about it after the nap because honestly I'm struggling to think clearly at the moment. But I think I get that - we give each other a say before deciding, yes?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s pretty much it. Not guessing what the other persons answer might be. Ask instead and find out.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Enjoy your nap.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sorry if it seems I keep banging on about this. It’s that I know I have a tendency to assume a person response and then react to that assumed response as it being truth. Which isn’t great and it then goes horrible against my poor ability to ask for what I want.\\
So it’s this cycle I am desperate to not repeat with you.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't worry. You know I prefer everything on the table and I appreciate that we are able to talk about everything. We are not repeating any cycles :face-blowing-a-kiss:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You feeling any better after your nap?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Still a bit fuzzy but hopefully just getting moving etc will help\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You still going to the Slovak shop?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup yup\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Can't be just loitering around :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, would want to be relaxed or anything :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I need to do something from my list otherwise I'll just be sitting around stressed\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Your meant to be sitting around relaxed not stressed. Although today is the best day to go and to try and miss school rush hour traffic.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup yup\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It opens at two so trying to sort myself out :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Clothes on and go?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Almost :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Save the faffing for later :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Need to brush my teeth and hair and put some mascara at least so I don't look dead\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s 3 things\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, that's 3 things\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Only clothes left now\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: In fairness I haven’t moved much and I cancelled my session for later\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh did you? Not feeling good?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Feeling a bit better than this morning but it would be the same as Friday. I would be ok doing stuff but I’m trying to push it. I can do a half arsed session on my own and the body doesn’t respond right when you’re sick.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, sensible\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: If I just given to it and rest it should be better. In theory\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Do you have a tutorial?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not today\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It will be!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you still drinking ginger?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I ran out of actual ginger yesterday but did find some ginger beer\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not the same :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Lemon honey and hot water is still good\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah.\\
I’ll keep going with the lemon water\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okay\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Do you need anything?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You need to get going though. Otherwise you know what I said I’d do on Wednesday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m all good thanks.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've got 10 more mins\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Only 600 seconds\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Loads\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: For hair and makeup!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm done\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, well done\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to take a big hot bath when I get back\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good plan.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Right I'm off!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Enjoy. I hope they have what you want.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm back\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And sooo hungry\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: ahh, cats do the bag check as well\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you not eaten food yet today.....\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I had breakfast\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: ah ok\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you get what you wanted?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not everything. They were proper sold out of stuff and only got a delivery yesterday morning\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: wow, what were you missing? I spy a cake looking box\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I just picked up the remnants of what they had left. So expensive :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's a good thing I don't live closer because I'd be broke\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I just got like staple bits and pieces\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: or if they had a website.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And currently stuffing this cod mayo salad thing in my face\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Could you get stuff shipped from home or is that even more expensive\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That would be ridiculous expensive\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: There is one shop that has a website but again everything is double the price\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: that's cheeky of them.\\
So are you now having lunch or has lunch turned into your old person dinner\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: bath before your appointment?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Lunch\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've bought some of the super special sheep cheese to make with dumplings later\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: cheese is always good. How is it different from sheep cheese you can get here?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: We going to try the sushi thing again for tomorrow?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup yup. Please remind me at 8.15 tonight if you remember\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Veeeery different. Super special, only made home. Very hard to export\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Nice, I'll try to remind you as well\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Great, things can get CraZy :zany-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I always get excited when I get back from that shop. I tend to get like childhood staples so it's really nice\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Staples?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah like cupboard staples... Isn't that spelled like that?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh I get it.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Food basics\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: By the sounds of it you go a bit like a kid in a candy store but you have access to adult money.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeeeeeeahhh :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone::woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone::woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone::woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: DRUGS!!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Took them already :beaming-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I really appreciate how you remember\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: well, I was 20min late. Did you take them yesterday\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Uhmnmm\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: so that's a no\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :grimacing-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I dont think it would take a highly trained AI to conduct the pattern recognition on what goes on here\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahahah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I got home too late\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: could you not have taken them while your were out?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I should have taken them with me\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh, so one problem established then. Not carrying them with you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Need to go pick up a prescription this week too so I'm not left without\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've made the dumplings. I am so happy :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: well done\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: \url{https://www.printables.com/model/93492-pill-container}\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that's cool\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did your appointment go well?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's what you're focusing on?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It went well, thank you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well, no. I was trying to be classy\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okay okay\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: But now you mention it.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Erm, you’ve caught me a bit off guard\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: image omitted\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Teasing\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :woman-shrugging-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You've been asking\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have. I didn’t know you could do one time photos\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :winking-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also, those are your only thoughts?:eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well no. First thought was that I’d like to be there. Second was it would be good to see your face.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okay I'll let you off\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you fall asleep?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Forgot myself in the bath and just realised the water was freezing\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was your afternoon?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not surprised after 40 odd minutes. Will get cold.\\
It was ok. Really haven’t done much. Managed to do some busy work for uni so not a total write off.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't judge me! :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No judgement. I can spend just as long. I was trying to imagine what “forgot myself” would mean for you in the bath.\\
I see it’s means doom scrolling on instagram.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes :thumbs-up-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sushi!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh shit. :sushi:  :sushi:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've done it now\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Whoop\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully they will be available\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: When do you find out?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's a yes unless they email closer to the time that they sold out\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Only happened to me once\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Is this the one thing your leaving the flat for tomorrow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But it's not until 7.30 so you'll be here by then I'm thinking?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ouch that’s late.\\
Yeah I was planning on being there earlier than that.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well it's too good to go. This is one of the early ones\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: ?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hmm?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I was expecting a time for me to arrive tomorrow?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Then ask! :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I did :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That was not a question\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Anyway. What time should I come round Tomorrow?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Would 5-5.30 work?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Which is it? It not like I have far to drive\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Then I guess we can both go and pick up the food?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I can just pop up.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Let's say 5\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Great. I’m sure we can find something to do before dinner. With that much time might even be able to do 2 things.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Can I do a cards on the table thing\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well that spiked the heart rate. Not quite what I was thinking but sure. Shall I bring the cards with me or do you have a stack of questions in mind. <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I meant now\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh sorry. I misread\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You’ll have to now\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nothing major, just to get it out of my head\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Let me preface it with saying I am not upset. But after all the times you've asked me for a pic, I kind of expected a more, I don't know, enthusiastic response :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh, sorry. I thought I underplayed it. You completely caught me off guard with it and I wasn’t expecting it. Then being a one view photo I wasn’t able to “fully appreciate” it before I closed it and worked out what was going on.\\
Then I felt I pushed too hard the other day so I backed off in pushing for more.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: As I said, I just needed to get it out of my head :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I did \/ do *really* appreciate what you did. I might have then got stuck in my own head a bit as well.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Why?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Because I knew I pushed it to far on Saturday and that wasn’t for naked pictures. I get that pictures of you in the bath vs underwear are equally revealing.\\
So I didn’t really know how to take it further without feeling I’d pushed it over the limit I already went over.\\After you sent the first one (of the bath) my first thought was imagining you touching yourself in the bath. And that would be nice to see.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I appreciate you explaining it :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: As long at it makes sense and I don’t come across too badly\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No you didn't :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: don't worry\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well that’s good to know and I do \/ will.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: My brain is now trying and failing to work out what I should have done and work out what I’ve missed out on :man-facepalming:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I didn't mean for you to think about it this hard. Just wanted to openly communicate\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Too late for not thinking hard :face-with-tears-of-joy: I’ll try again next time.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's the spirit! I mean we're still very much getting to know each other and I'd rather we speak about things in our heads as they come rather than letting them fester and overthink them\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Agreed\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m assuming you’re in bed now?\\
I am. So I’ll wish you good night. x.\\Looking :eyes: forward to seeing you tomorrow\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am not! But will be going shortly.\\
Look forward to seeing you too\\Sleep well, night night x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: What! You’re still up.\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I slept some :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: how are you feeling?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Some is good.\\
Feeling pretty good and suspect will get better once I move around and get food.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I went to the gym. It's really raining :pensive-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You’ve been and gone to the gym already?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No I'm here now\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Enjoy.  I’m going to try and do a session tomorrow at some point.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Don’t wear yourself out too much :winking-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am so weak today :loudly-crying-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And it's yukky outside :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Weak how?\\
It is certainly an inside day\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just felt weak. Struggled with lifting and pushing\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Some days are like that. What weight did you get to?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I seem to be cursed with sumo’s\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I mean... I did pb on everything :face-with-tears-of-joy: but like my upper body is tiny itty bitty weights\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: What’s a BB squat\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not necessarily. I kind of pick and choose form a variety of things I've done with her\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Barbell\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh, so normal squats\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Your legs are strong. If your squatting close to body weight\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I'm a machine on legs but absolute chicken arms\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not yet\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: 60kg has to be pretty close. Your not that heavy\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm sturdy\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not words I would use\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What would you use?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Erm, compact would be better.\\
Short, cute, fit, pretty etc\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Compact :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What’s your plan for the rest of day now?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nap, tidy up, shower, hair wash, you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How about you?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Feel well enough to do some work so I should do that. Was going to take my brother lunch as he really isn’t doing well but he said no. Will try again tomorrow. Then shower at some point before I’m going over to this super cute girls flat to spend the night. Very exciting.\\
How is showering and hair 2 separate line items? These are the same.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's a good plan.\\
I do get him. I'd probably want to be with myself for a bit too.\\Very exciting indeed.\\Nope. Hair requires far more post shower treatment\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: He is keeping himself busy which is the bit I was making sure of.\\
One of the many things us men don’t have to deal with.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And how lucky you men are. There's definitely been times when I contemplated just cutting it all off\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: Home. Thank for yesterday evening and this morning.\\
I hope you get some rest. They have to be nearly finished with the ground work. So hopefully not too much more noise.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you for coming and spending time with me :smiling-face-with-hearts: sorry I was a grump this morning.\\
They are still not finished\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You weren’t grumpy you are tired and in pain.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I really enjoyed having you here x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :smiling-face: I really enjoyed being there. x.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I quite like you, you know\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I had hoped :grinning-face: so good to know.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I do hope you know!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I do.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: We can rethink the sleeping at Christmas. Already got the brain working on it.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ooh, excited to find out what you think of :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And it’s only the price that makes it truly stupid £5k\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What????\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's very silly\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Exactly. They are for offices\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well we might have to think of something else\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: 2 more sensible options I’ve come up with so far. I don’t stay over and just drive home then drive back in the morning or I have an inflatable bed that should fit in your lounge and I sleep on that. Might have to move the couch slightly.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I mean I want you to stay over because it was so lovely cuddling up to you, but I don't know how we'll make it work so I sleep too. Hopefully the sinuses will clear and you'll have an easier time breathing. Make sure you do the steam. You should have enough for two in the baggy\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I like the cuddling as well. Just need to find something that works. Just bad  if no one sleeps well.\\
Has the gardening stopped?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just now. I've climbed into bed\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh good. Weighted blanket time.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm alive. Only managed about an hour but still. How's uni work going?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s good. Are you feeling any better?\\
Uni work has gone. Actually got the software to work and got a result. So it’s good enough for my assignment. Just trying it again and then need to muster the energy for cosmology\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not majorly but I'm just going to take today easy.\\
Oh well done!\\You can smash the cosmology too. What's the plan after?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
After! There is no after with the cosmology stuff.\\After will be food my video tutorial thingy on getting my bolloxs removed. Depending on when that finishes maybe some games but will try for an early night.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha I thought you were going to the gym?\\
Oh yes, castration webinar!\\Early night is the name of the game!\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That was a thought at some stage before today but I’ll do a gym session after spin tomorrow. Already warmed up then plus it’s only a 30 min spin.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You going to at least have a bath?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes definitely\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: A bit of a brain dump of questions.\\
Your thoughts on Boxing Day. We are walking with people in the morning and I guess we’d have lunch. What was happening in the afternoon\/ evening? I think we are doing our own thing but not sure if I made that up.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: When am I seeing you next? Saturday I assume. See you at Park run. Then I need to go to my parents to sort out some Xmas stuff and will have lunch. Gives you time for a nap or whatever before evening and then for the evening before we go to Matt’s did you want to come to mine first so we have some time together before interacting with people.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Xmas eve you tell me a time\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I haven't thought about boxing Day afternoon or evening yet. Did you have anything in mind?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That would be a brilliant plan for Saturday, thank you :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Would 6 be good?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not really no. Just my Mum was checking if I was busy or not. I think to make sure I was doing something.\\
So I don’t really mind. We can spend time together or if you’d rather do something else I can do something else.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Are you going  to be awake that late :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Was thinking maybe 4 to be at mine and then I think we are going to Matt’s for 6\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly I haven't really thought that far :face-with-tears-of-joy: if you have family bits to do that's brill, I'm probably going to be up for hybernating as there's something on every day of the hols\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Fingers crossed!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, that sounds good :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I don’t have family bits to do but know we both might want some time to ourselves. We will technically be seeing each other for 4 days in a row.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Can always be earlier if needed\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Cool, we can decide closer to the time :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It all gets soo complicated over the holiday.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It does!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And I'm really conscious of trying to really calm down and reset for the new term :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That has been the plan. Today might be the first day you don’t leave the flat?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not the right way to do it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I will only pop to Michelle's to drop off the hats\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Time for my brain dump question.\\
Did you enjoy yourself last night\/this morning?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Your questions are different are different from mine :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yes as a short version but I was disappointed in my own performance. I can do better.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy: just popped into my head\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Why are you disappointed?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Don’t get the wrong version of disappointed. I just know I should have performed better this morning and yesterday in my mind before I even got to your place I’d thought about has having sex twice. So before dinner like we did and then before we went to sleep.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: To be clear I was not disappointed having sex with you. That is amazing.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just that it didn't happen before bed? :winking-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That and I could have done better this morning\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Plus there is so much more to do and try than we have done so…\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't put too much pressure on yourself. I had fun\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sure, I’ll see how well I do with that but good.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not taking this kind of negativity into 2024 :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you think I didn’t enjoy myself then?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't know, I wasn't sure\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hmm ok. It’s a very strange question for me. You might be the first person to ask.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Really? I just like to make sure that we're both enjoying ourselves :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sorry was on the phone.\\
Certainly my last partner never asked.\\That's good. Me to. Just need more practice :winking-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well I'm not like anyone else am I? :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: no, you are not.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Drugs!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Taken :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Webinar meeting tutorial thingy done. Recovery time for cycling is longer than I thought. Did you make it to Michelle's?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh how was it? What did they tell you?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No we rescheduled because she had some stuff to do so I successfully have not left the house. In bath now\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was fine. A very specific demographic, which is expected but still funny.\\
They say read and follow the rules and it will all be fine. The guy who does it is German which has to be a good thing. 12-15000 and never had one fail.\\Maybe 3 weeks of not cycling, which I hope not but we will see.\\20 weeks minimum before testing\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah that's good! What's the timescale for close encounters?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: “Close encounter” :face-with-tears-of-joy: a week and I need to get to at least 40 before 20 weeks is up but more is much better.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 40 in 20 weeks eh?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well it’s 19 really because you have to take the first week off but yeah. At least!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Doesn't this just work well for you :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well it has the opportunity to work out well for me. Especially if someone is willing to help…\\
And you should always follow doctors advise.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It has the opportunity, that's true!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I was thinking we could work it on an exchange basis. 2 for you. One for me. So no one feels left out.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha, that's a good ratio\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s a ratio I like. Higher is better obviously.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah, of course\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m actually in bed before 9! Weird. I’ll wish you good night.\\
Hopefully you don’t have someone snoring and keeping you up all night.\\Night. x.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh you are in early!\\
Hope you sleep better than last night.\\Night night x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I hope you sleep better as well. You had it much worse than I did.\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: Morning. Hope you slept better.\\
Let’s see what’s spin like today!\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning!\\
I did sleep a bit better, thank you.\\Hope spin is good x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s good. Your up early though?\\
Spin was rough. Glad it was only 30mins. Spin is a good check of how well you’re feeling. Body still isn’t 100\% otherwise I wouldn’t have sweated so much.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah meeting Laura for a coffee catch-up in town.\\
Well glad you survived spin! What's the plan for the rest of the day?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh nice. Badger?\\
Plan for the day is work, maybe sort out some house stuff. Will see if my brother is about for lunch but I suspect he’ll be taking another day off work. Will see.\\Then I’ve got my friend Becky coming over for dinner later. Should be a fairly chilled day.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup yup, badger.\\
Oh that sounds like a nice productive day :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\Having anything nice for dinner with Becky?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just keeping it simple for dinner. Steak and chips.\\
Hopefully a productive day. We will see.\\Enjoy coffee.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that's nice. I enjoyed it when you made it for me.\\
Thanks. I'm already in full swing of food shop\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think it’s the least ingredient meal I cook, so simple and fast.\\
Good luck food shopping. Try not to murder anyone.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I didn't murder anyone :face-with-tears-of-joy: still got Sainsbury's to go for couple bits but might do that either stupid early or late another time\\
Good luck with the uni and house work\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also...\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: <attached: 00003937-GIF-2023-12-21-10-20-45.mp4>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done for not murdering people.\\
I’m not sure the timing will matter too much now with he shopping. Early is probably better though.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am not that bad, am I? :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Your well researched into the murdering of people so who knows :woman-shrugging:\\
I know I want to murder people when I go shopping. <This message was edited>\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aren't you supposed to say something like ' oh you're the loveliest person I've ever met. No way'? :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I mean. Yes of course.\\
However, you did also want to murder the gardeners yesterday. So\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00003943-GIF-2023-12-21-11-33-35.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, I'm just fishing for compliments really :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, well you are amazing and very pretty.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah. Thanks :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I do like getting compliments from you :woman-shrugging-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Know that I am trying to get better at giving them.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know you are :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I should be giving you more of them too\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: They will just make me akward.\\
How was coffee?\\I haven’t even done that much work today and my brain has given up.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But are you alright with me telling you that you're lovely and I appreciate you?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Coffee with badger this morning was nice.\\
Just got back into the car from lunch with the work peeps. That was actually quite lovely too.\\How's your afternoon? Apart from the brain\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: :smiling-face-with-hearts: yeah this is ok.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Busy day for you then.\\
That’s good.\\Could Badger help you with a new job? Might have asked already.\\Is she single now or still in her situationship? Just noticed a few more single related things on her FB.\\Good work people lunch went well.\\Afternoons been ok. Got some house stuff sorted. Nice lunch with my brother. He seems to be doing a little bit better today, which is good.\\Been watching some cosmology lectures but starting to fall asleep. It’s all very interesting but hurts the brain.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well then I'll keep doing that\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Very :sleeping-face:\\
Yes, you've already asked and no unfortunately.\\Oh, how do you know about situationship?\\Oh I'm glad you went for lunch with your brother and that he's a little better. It will take time.\\Could you rest a little before Becky comes?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know things. People tell me stuff. I was a government approved secret keeping for a number of years.\\
I think it came up in Starbucks once. A bunch of us were talking about dating or it was when she was doing some track running over the summer.\\Then over the summer Facebook was obsessed with telling me that she had liked a speed dating thing. So I’d asked her if she was going to their boat party thing and she was still in the situationship then.\\I can rest a bit. More drinks and brighter lights :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well don't you just know everything! Yet you thought I was married for a second! Nah she's single . Interested? :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
More drinks and brighter lights?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s because I was given duff information on you but I worked it out eventually.\\
Not interested in the way you just implied :face-with-tears-of-joy:. I don’t know Laura very well but I do know she deserves better than just being someone’s side piece when they could be bothered and being in any sort of relationship is only going to stop you moving forward.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Exciting\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha you did! (I'm glad)\\
:face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:Just checking.\\You are absolutely right. She deserves so much more than that. I am certain she'll absolutely have that this year :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Omg!!!! The kid of the Syrian restaurant guy sent me some home made baklava :drooling-face::drooling-face::drooling-face::drooling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I would suggesting setting her up with my single friend but as much as he *really* does need someone to punch him in the face it would be far too mean for Laura.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Aww :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Brighter lights to wake me up and more liquids in general. Not booze\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah. Yeah, let's not :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aaaaaah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: When's Becky coming?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is not what I thought. I thought it was cake.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: About 7:30 but we shall see.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha!\\
Well hope you're resting\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Are you  it mean to save these (minus food) u til Xmas eve?\\
That is cool\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nooooooo :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It was pretty much all food apart from the candle\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: When are we doing presents. Eve or day? Not that it really makes any difference\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We can do Christmas day :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't know what it is but I'm feeling super cuddly today\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well it’s quite late in the day for me to be able to do anything with this critical information. :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know :confused-face: you'll just have to squeeze me extra on Saturday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sure thing :winking-face:\\
Isn’t the cat helping or were you being polite and using cuddly instead of horny\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No no, cuddly. I'm feeling a little, I don't know, needy (but in a nice way) today\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well then the cat should be stepping up more :grinning-face:.\\
Maybe you’re just well rested? Or the reverse.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Could probably arrange a hugg for tomorrow if it still takes your fancy.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Maybe. I don't know\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ooooooh... Well that's a good option\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: So you're never going to get soppy drunken texts from me ( and I love those) so it will just have to be random streams of consciousness\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00003991-GIF-2023-12-21-17-23-54.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Done :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sending or receiving?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Both\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But obviously I don't send drunken texts anymore :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well you don’t have the excuse of being drunk\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll just have to send sober soppy ones\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I might send stuff but I don’t think it will be soppy probably sexual over soppy if I’ve been drinking or complete auto correct garbage\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I like soppy\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll see what I can do.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm really going a roundabout way telling you that I really love your hugs. They are very comforting, like I can just melt into them\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I wonder if I can write a python script  that checks my calendar to know if I’ve been out drinking. Then when I get home and connect to WiFi it sends you something. Might just be easier to write the txt myself.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Aww :smiling-face-with-hearts: that is a really round about way. :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha. Yeah it might\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well whatever. It's still true\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thanks though. I’m not sure what  else to say. I just hug, I’m big and you’re small.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Am I making you feel awkward?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Maybe\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Wasn't my intention\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you get anymore hats made?\\
Dinner went well. Becky’s dog never seems to settle in my house. A really nice dog but just will not lie down. Becky has a 1st date tomorrow that could have a good story with it :crossed-fingers:. Nothing wrong with it but the gym seems to be a big fan of sex clubs and it’s a very important thing for him that his partner is into it as well. So Becky might be learning a lot tomorrow\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Almost finished with the one before last! Just in bed now.\\
Glad you had a nice time.\\Haha, well there's definitely a story there! Is she meeting him locally?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Do you have a PT session tomorrow? I might go to the gym if I'm up early\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: They are meeting in some pub on the way to Henley. I’d never heard of it before.\\
Well done on the hat.\\Yeah I have a session at 7:30.\\I wondered if you’d be stalking me again :face-with-tears-of-joy: be nice to see you and I thought we could arrange a quick hug at some point tomorrow regardless.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Excuuuuse me... Stalking? You'll miss it when I'm back at work :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah , when I slept I slept well but I was up a few times. Did you sleep well?\\
I'm up so hopefully should make it to the gym :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Might need to give you my “don’t check the phone” at night speech :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Slept pretty well thanks.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Nice seeing you this morning.\\
What are your plans for the day. Baking and then seeing people on the evening?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Lovely seeing you too and thanks for the cuddle.\\
Yup that's pretty much it, maybe a nap in the middle :grinning-face-with-sweat:\\How about you?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Cuddle wasn’t long enough.\\
All I’m doing is work and I need to wrap at least some presents.\\Do you have time \/ wanted to meet for a hug?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I could pop around when I'm coming back from Michelle's but I have no idea when that will be\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What’s the ish time? This morning afternoon evening?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh. Evening definitely\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I guess I can wait that long :grinning-face: just let me know\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. Once I know what's happening I'll let you know :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yay, just so I can plan out when I’m eating. Are you eating with your friends?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I'll probably eat either at home or something. Don't worry, you have your dinner when you want. It will be a flying visit as it seems I've planned too much for myself yet again today :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’d did sound like you’d planned a lot at the end of the day. I could always come to you if that helps in anyway.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. I'll let you know\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What are you planning to bake? Don’t say cookies.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Btw, I'll be doing a my protein\/my vitamins order in the next week or so - do you need anything?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well that's as far as I've gotten. I need to have a look at what I have and some recipes\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That you but pHD had a sale and I forgot to cancel an Amazon repeat so I think I currently have 8kg of protein powder.\\
What magnesium do you take as I need some more of that\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Myprotein Creatine Monohydrate Powder - 250G \url{https://amzn.eu/d/ag9fQXb}\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll have to have a look about the magnesium as it's the back of my cupboard. Will let you know :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I just realised I've got no icing sugar so got to go out for it :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Doh, I do have a box but I have no idea when I bought it. It seems to be a solid block\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The Tesco express or even co-op should have it. Save a full trip into town.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just going to pop to Sainsbury's and pick up what I needed anyway :confused-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Enjoy, hopefully it’s not mega busy for you.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well they have parking attendants :face-with-tears-of-joy: it's going to be horrendous\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00004047-GIF-2023-12-22-11-24-28.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: God I need a nap :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I mean. That could suggest it was a horrid experience OR it’s a normal day and you need a nap because your a cat\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy: the first one. Now to get out of the car park\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, that’s no fun. Hope you have a good nap. Don’t forget about lunch.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00004052-GIF-2023-12-22-12-12-18.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've heard from Katie and she'll be coming round about 5\/5.30 so I will go to Michelle's around 6.\\
I don't know what time I'll be coming back so don't want to keep you waiting and I don't think I'll have time beforehand :pensive-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You can just let me know. I’m not going anywhere or we can just wait till tomorrow.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you. I'd say come round but I'd still need to shower and wash my hair and my flat is a mess :loudly-crying-face: and just don't know where the time is going. Shall we say tomorrow - sorry I'm so disorganized today\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Half intrigued to see what your version of a messy flat is :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
I’ve not showered either.\\Tomorrow it is.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha. Messy by my standards. Needs a hoover and tidy up. And I tend to spread out when I'm baking so the whole kitchen is now covered :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00004058-GIF-2023-12-22-13-31-53.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How did you manage to take a video of me??\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well you do have that camera in your living room :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Coconut somethings\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They are called coconut kisses.\\
And it true fashion of today. Two of my trays don't fit into this oven :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh no. How do you have trays that don’t fit.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: From my old place. Apparently I haven't used them here ( probably because they don't fit) :loudly-crying-face::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: For the garbage now then.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The trays obviously, not the biscuits\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They are brand new :loudly-crying-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And unused for 3 years…\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll give them to somey\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: *someone\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Do you need any?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: If they’ll fit I can certainly use them\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki I'll show you them later\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's cosmology going?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s going. Going to shower and then try wrapping presents with the lectures on.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Somewhat interesting to learn that despite how much of the universe we see. We cannot be sure what type of curvature it has. And if it’s isn’t flat then the universe could be at least 10 times bigger than we already think it is .\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I can help you with some of them before we go to Matt's tomorrow if you'd like?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Space is fascinating. We're never going to know even most of it let alone all\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thanks. I best wrap yours first then :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha. Probs\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How did the baking go?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah well. Only managed the coconut ones and made the dough for two others but unfortunately they need to sit in the fridge overnight :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your evening been?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh, at least they will bake easy tomorrow.\\
Evenings been ok. I always forget how bad I am and how much I dislike wrapping but I got it done. Might be the earliest I’ve had it done for a long time. Otherwise the day went very fast.\\You back home now? How was Katie and Agi?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully, but it will take ages. Regretting signing up to volunteer now :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Ah well done! Have you finished them all?\\Yup home now. Katie's well and I sent Agi's prezzie with her and I went to Michelle's\\I spoke to Katie and we're thinking 9.30\/10 for the walk on boxing Day\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Are they going to take a long time to bake then?\\
Yeah, they are all finished. Minus putting together the boxes of doom for the kids and that’s only because I don’t have change yet. Will be getting that tomorrow. I know you offered to help but I got in a grove and have been able to tidy up.\\Early on Boxing Day but that works for me.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: A lot of rolling and cutting out so yea.\\
I do have change too if you need any\\Yeah we're early birds :face-with-tears-of-joy: but we can get coffee at spade oak after and then have lunch at home\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh, you had to rest the  whole dough.\\
Thanks, I’ll let you know. My mum hoards change. If anything I might need help putting it together.\\Sounds like fun though.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes the whole thing. Will hopefully do one tomorrow and one Sunday\\
It was lovely\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm in bed now so will say goodnight. Sleep well and see you in the morning x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m about to go to bed myself.\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: Morning. x.\\
You were awake early again. Did you sleep ok?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I was! Awake even before the cat :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone: was in an out again.\\
How about you?\\Just got to the rye. See you in a bit\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh yeah you’re volunteering. I forget that means you have to get there early.\\
Did you take your drugs yesterday? Worrying about something?\\I slept ok but feels like I could use more. I think today’s run is going to be rough. We will see.\\See you in a bit. x.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I did take my drugs. Important thing is not to forget to pick up my prescription after pr today.\\
I'm just by busy bees with jingle bells x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is going to be a hard gif to find :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::purple-heart:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: As an idea. You could always bring the cookie dough stuff and we could cook them at mine. Assuming they take less that 2 hours. I’m sure we can find something to do while they are in the oven.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you for offering but I think I'll just knock them out tomorrow morning. I think it would stress me out having to cart every to yours and back :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No problem. Just throwing out ideas.\\
FYI - it’s afternoon now :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know, that's why I said tomorrow morning :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: OH. I missed that bit :man-facepalming:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Don’t forget to bring drugs. x.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you x\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm really sorry but I'm running about 10-15mins late - grandma rang unexpectedly for a chat\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No prob. I’ve just stepped out of the shower. So you have missed the chance of my answering the door half dressed :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh shit :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Fear not. I am now dressed.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Booooo\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It can be fixed very quickly :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've done my hair and face!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just underwear and overcoat needed then\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Leaving in 1 minx\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Missed picture opportunity\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Really enjoyed seeing you tonight. You looked great btw.\\
Hope it wasn’t too scary.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I really enjoyed spending time with you too. Hope I wasn't too mean :grimacing-face:\\
Enjoy the rest of the evening x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: No, just the right amount of mean :grinning-face:\\
Don’t forget eggs! x.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly I hope I wasn't mean at all. Just funnily teasy :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
I didn't. I brought them up. It was super quick getting home.\\P.s. tell me everything people say about me :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: So far only very positive things.\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: So on best behaviour?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Matt was yes. He is much better when Michelle is around.\\

\section*{Sunday $24\textsuperscript{th}$}
Again, I really enjoyed seeing you tonight and us just being on the sofa was really fun.\\Obviously I would have also like to have done more (to be clear you looked smoking hot. Omg) but it was really nice just holding you and talking.\\I like that I’m a calming influence on you. I’m not sure what or how I’m doing it but I’m glad I’m doing it.\\Already looking forward to seeing you tomorrow. Slightly worried about ruining a night sleep but hopefully it will be better this time.\\I really like you.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning X\\
Hope you slept well. Did you have a good time last night?\\I really enjoyed yesterday with you too and as I said I really appreciate you. I don't know how you're calming me either but you definitely are :smiling-face:\\I look forward to seeing you today too.\\And I really like you!\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Morning X\\
I enjoyed last night. I hadn’t seen or spoke to Lester in a while. So that was good and I left at the right time, didnt need  to be drinking anymore.\\:smiling-face-with-hearts:\\You’re up early! Have you been and done the gym already?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh bloody hell :loudly-crying-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hello! How are you feeling?\\
No, gym doesn't open till 9 anyway. Have been baking since like 6.30.\\Just so much to do today.\\What's your plan for the day?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Can always try and find a way for you to stay at mine.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Feeling ok. Managed to avoid a hangover. So that’s good.\\
I thought the gym was late.\\How is the baking going? Have all the calls started yet?\\Happy Christmas.\\My plan today is to have a day off and chill. Still not played with my new printer so that is the plan, once I get up and out of bed.\\Then later this afternoon I get to have have dinner with this amazing person I like.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Wonder where this is if they mentioned princes risborough\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yay for no hangover!\\
I realised yesterday that I have the laser early on Wednesday but I'll give them a call to see if I can reschedule so I can come to the gym with you.\\Baking is going. I'm already exhausted :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\Thank you :smiling-face-with-hearts::Christmas-tree:\\Sounds like a good plan. And what a coincidence! I'm also having a dinner with a lovely person x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think princes risborough is there staging area and then they will run the engineer trains from there. I got it from the Downley Facebook group.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00004146-GIF-2023-12-24-09-34-18.mp4>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Will the laser place answer if you contact them?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Boo\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's the exact scene right now :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to really try for a nap\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They are open today so hopefully\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh that’s good then. About the laser place.\\
Somehow I am not suprised you’re a messy chef.\\Don’t put too much pressure on the nap otherwise it won’t happen.\\Do you still want me at 6 tonight?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I want you all the time but yes please for 6 :winking-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I have a power cut\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh no! :crying-face: how long has it been out for?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: About half hour\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly, today is looking progressively like it can get in a bin\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Definitely lost power to the whole building and not just you?\\
I saw your FB post about the post. :man-facepalming: that not even your building. Probably a flat next to yours <This message was edited>\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The whole building, Amy from downstairs let us know.\\
Yeah, that's another extra lovely thing for today\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Is there an outage notice from the power company?\\
Can I help at all?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes there is. I just called 105. Apparently aiming to have it back on for 5pm.\\
Honestly feel like a cry. Can't clean, can't cook, can't even take a shower\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hopefully it’s not out for that long. So rare for long power cuts.\\
Obviously you can shower at mine if the power doesn’t come back. Could cook at mine as well if it’s not a massive faff.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I really hope so too.\\
If it's not back for after 5 I might have to do that. I look like hell, am cold and weepy. You're in for a treat :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: If it’s still off in a couple of hours we can have a rethink.\\
While it’s very frustrating we can just adjust the plan. Got no control over it.\\Can always just have our evening here at mine. Bit of a faff but part of the adventure.\\I highly doubt you look like hell.\\It’s hard but try not to get too upset.\\Still looking forward to seeing you.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00004166-GIF-2023-12-24-13-54-05.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's just because this is a really hard day for me so all these things going wrong just pushed me over.\\
If it doesn't get sorted I'll come to you :smiling-face: not clean and all :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\Haha, I do. Need\/want a shower.\\I am still very much looking forward to seeing you too\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I wish I knew a better way to help you. I still don’t know why today is bad for you and you don’t need to tell me but try not to link the things together.\\
I can promise not to look at you too much until after the shower if you do come here.\\Why don’t we say if no power at 3:30  you at least come and use mine?  We can move all cooking as well. Then we can go back to feed spud etc and check power later. It might trip a fuse when it come back on.\\We can work out the rest of the evening as it happens.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You just being here for listening is more than enough :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
Haha brill!\\I've just started on the salad as doesn't need cooking so let's see at 4?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also, I had a little cry to my murder mates and look what I just got through the door\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh wow, that really nice of them.\\
4 it is.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm now having a little happy cry :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: IVE GOT POWER!!!!!\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yay, glad it’s back. Back to plan A then.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Dinner might not be ready by the time you get here though as I'm majorly behind\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s completely fine. Try not to worry about that.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. I'm currently drinking a very delish hot choc\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Are we watching the holiday later? Or did you watch it already.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, together :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you sort out your laser appointment?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes yes\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did Hannah day I could come with?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yes you can stalk :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Brill!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Should I bring my inflatable bed?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nooo\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Btw I've buggered the potato salad so there's that too for today :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m afraid to ask how\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just doesn't taste right\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: On my way.\\

\section*{Monday $25\textsuperscript{th}$}
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I just realised you didn't make it to parkrun :pensive-face: sorry\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Don’t need to be sorry. Was much nicer being in bed with you.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It was nice, wasn't it :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah I really liked it. The only reason I was going to do parkrun was if being in bed with you wasn’t an option.\\
Hopefully next time you can get even more sleep.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh why wouldn't that be an option. I love cuddles with you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: To start with I was going to do ParkRun before we were dating. So it wasn't an option then. Then there may have been a little bit of overthinking \/ overplanning that if we were up super early (and stayed awake) you'd want to kick me out.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Do you always think I'm going to kick you out? :pleading-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: no, I just know you had your plan for today and I knew I had to leave when I did. I just like being prepared.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes but I genuinely do like spending time with you.\\
Are you all ready to be picked up?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: \url{https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGeFxvGL6/}\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep. all ready. Was just playing a couple of games. A bit of an odd Christmas day tradition I have done for a long time.\\
I thought you'd be napping?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aw cute. Traditions are nice\\
I've just climbed into bed so will be.\\Enjoy your day. Hope it's all brilliant :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: How did the rest of your day go?\\
Just made it home. Fun afternoon but also long. Kids were still awake as we left.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's been okay. Pottered around, had dinner, bath and finished a hat.\\
How was the food? And prezies? Did mum like the giant clock?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You do like your pottering :face-with-tears-of-joy: well done on getting another hat done.\\
The food was ok. My mum had overcooked the turkey but it was all good. Just over and done with so fast. The kids wind me up with eating but they were better than normal.\\Presents were mental. Full chaos. I need to check but a fair amount of food and some booze. Some new shirts and socks, new dewalt blower for the workshop and a couple of cool little things.\\The clock went down well. The kids liked the box more.\\I’m looking forward to our walk tomorrow. I’m not even sure I’ve eaten or drank that much today but I think the reality is different.\\Thank you for last night and this morning. I really enjoyed spending time with you. Your amazing.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: One more to go!\\
Ah it's more about the company anyway. Must have been nice to be all together.\\Oh nice. Glad she liked it. What little cool things did you get? I like finding out what people got :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\I'm looking forward to the walk too! I almost went earlier but it was already dark so thought better of it.\\Thank you for spending it with me. I really enjoy it, every time. You're amazing too\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah it was nice that the whole family are together. Doesn’t happen very often.\\
I got a cool insulated mug thing, an impossible puzzle that Oliver somehow did, specific running socks and normal socks.\\Tomorrow be the best day for the walk as well. Looks bad for the rest of the week.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh those are cool presents :smiling-face: you've done well today.\\
Brill! Perfect timing then!\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to head to bed so I can be at yours nice and early :smiling-face:\\

Have you eaten?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I haven't managed a nap. But took down the tree and just making dinner :smiling-face:\\
How's your afternoon been?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh well done.\\
Been ok. Literally just sat and played some games. Currently making dinner out of your leftovers. I’m not sure what you’d call it but it my favourite roast left over food. Chop it up. Throw in a frying pan to reheat and then bind it all with eggs.\\I would call it an omelette but people have said it’s too much for an omelette\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You're making a turkey, roast potato omelette? :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And stuffing\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah. Let me know how it is!\\

Will also be lunch tomorrow.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It was massive! We both enjoyed it :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\

Hope you sleep better. See you tomorrow\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00004245-GIF-2023-12-27-06-37-31.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did you sleep well?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok, I woke up before my alarm which was odd.\\
How about you? Instagram gave you away. Seems you were up early as well.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I was. Still not sleeping that great. Hopefully I won't just lay on one of the mats to stretch and fall asleep :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :crying-face: sorry your not sleeping well. Is that because you ran out of drugs?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No, it's just one of the fibro things\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So much fun.\\
You still going to the gym?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: So much fun indeed.\\
Yup, dressed and chewing on preworkout\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You’re ahead of me then. I’ll see you in a bit\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: See you in a bit\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Nice seeing you this morning.\\
I had a thought…..\\The Ikea stuff you mentioned that would sort out the TV end of your lounge. Could you order that so that it arrives next week and we could then put it all together \/ build it somewhere on the 5th, 6th and \/ or 7th.\\Then that starts off your new year flat renovation?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: <attached: 00004257-GIF-2023-12-27-09-05-51.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Lovely seeing you too :smiling-face:\\
That is a good thought but I have decision paralysis and budget restraints :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\I will have a look if I can swing it\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Analysis paralysis I can help with. Send me some links.\\
Perfection is the enemy of good enough\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: A thumbs up?? :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Pressed the wrong one\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, you can change it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sure sure :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll send you some after I have some food :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: \url{https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/kallax-lack-tv-storage-combination-white-s09552172/}\\
As a start. We could always put the tv on the wall on a swivel mount to give some more worktop space.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I've got the things I want saved :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m sure. I was just having a Quick Look. Their pricing of stuff seems very inconsistent\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, it is all so all over the place\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thats not a tv unit?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Wait!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'd like the first one in the corner minus the last bookcase, then the TV unit, then the double bookcase\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Corner unit on the wall where you currently have the TV?\\
Think it would be too big\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It could work behind the sofa and shift your desk to the left (facing it)\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh I see. That would work\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s nice.  More storage as well.\\
Only thought I have with the angled corner one. It will probably have to be pulled out from the wall a bit to line it up with the tv unit.\\So there may be a gap between that and the wall. Can be filled eventually\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The unit is 42 deep\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I could get some extra shelf boxes to take it up to the ceiling\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep. I’m pretty sure it’s a solid brick wall so easy to hang stuff\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So this plus the tv unit? With all 3 bits it could make it all very wide\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Maybe just the TV bench and the taller unit?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That would work. You’d have to measure but I think if you had all of it you the TV would be very off center and you’d start to block the hall.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Could get something to go above the tv\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You see! How can I decide?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: By choosing :face-with-tears-of-joy: above the tv is extra not instead of\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But I can't choose! What if it doesn't fit or look good?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: A tape measure solves the fit problem\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Are you super keen on the angled corner shelves?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't know\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Then drop those\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm just thinking it saves space rather than have them all next to each other\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: This is nice but maybe install the other way around so big is in the corner\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m thinking the angled shelf will take up more than it might save.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Then have a normal bookcase to the right of your window\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I kind of have this thing about having a wall of bookcases\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But wouldn't that block part of the other one?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And then either have shelves or wall mounted book case above the tv\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It would have to be pulled away from the wall the depth of the bookcase\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: So there would be dead space in the corner\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yes\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Could get the wall mounted bit of this \url{https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/besta-tv-storage-combination-white-hanviken-stubbarp-white-s09411969/}\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Do you have the actual links. I could do some math\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I do\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hold on\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Check out this BESTÅ \/ LACK from IKEA\\
Here's a little more information:\\TV storage combination, black-brown, 240x42x193 cm\\\url{https://ingka.page.link/XR7KWbi3Konxo5Wc7}\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Check out this BESTÅ from IKEA\\
Here's a little more information:\\TV storage combination\/glass doors, black-brown Selsviken\/Glassvik dark olive-green, 300x42x193 cm\\\url{https://ingka.page.link/GCBmgSZAeAk53TebA}\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Check out this BILLY from IKEA\\
Here's a little more information:\\Bookcase combination\/crnr solution, black-brown, 95\/95x28x202 cm\\\url{https://ingka.page.link/8JsEdj4sQA1D4teJ8}\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think this plus the book case will be too wide. It would nearly 3.4m from the wall to the end cabinet. If you drop the small cabinet it should fit. Would still need to measure.\\
Like this but the tv stand is too wide \url{https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/besta-tv-storage-combination-glass-doors-dark-grey-sindvik-vaesterviken-dark-grey-s09556047/}\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You need to measure from the wall out to where your tree was. Then that how much space you have.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah will have to do that\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: God I'm so overwhelmed\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: There are too many options.\\
You could start with the corner book case. Then just move along what you have already to see?\\Maybe include a wall mounted book case as well that goes up against the ceiling.\\The save the tv unit. You might find you only need a new tv stand and not a whole bookcase to the right of the TV\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That is a very sensible plan of action\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well, I am very sensible.\\
The new problem is if you look. The corner bookcase isn’t available anywhere. Which means it might be discontinued\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Of course\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: They do have it in white and the wood effect. Cheaper in white as well\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I reeeeeally don't want white or wood though\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I might have to wait because none of the dark ones are available\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s a pain.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah :pensive-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Maybe bathroom is a better starting point,:face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Maybe and we can get the headboard installed\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Will need painting before installation. I was planning to fabric paint the bed baseboard and then the headboard. Hence why it's still in a box :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Fabric paint?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So it’s a fabric headboard\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nooo the bed base\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: So it matches\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh right. Do you have the paint?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Does it need painting (stupid question)\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, I'd like it to be like dark forest green\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You just need to remember that I have been doing 60+ hour weeks at work followed by an epic burnout. I've had very little time for taking care of myself let alone diy\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You don’t need to justify why DIY hasn’t been done.\\
I’d just like to help you do stuff\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And in the non-rationa part of my brain it feels like unless the floor is finished I can't do anything else\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And I would love for you to help me out. I really appreciate you for being willing :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You need to tell that part of your brain to be shhhh\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy: right\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The floor is the beading?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And a threshold to the kitchen\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And thresholds, and the front door\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Do you have the thresholds?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And bathroom and bedroom\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nope and not enough beading apparently either\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The stupid floor man was supposed to do it all\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Do you need the beading. I don’t remember there being a gap between the floor and wall\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I need a carpenter but 4 now ghosted me\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: There are biiig ones\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Threshold’s can be done once you get them.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And the beading\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I want a carpenter to do it tbh\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That certainly doesn’t stop the bed\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well rationally I know that :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: But the floor is easier if the headboard is installed on the bed\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So if you get paint for the bed we can do that\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to have a nap and hopefully wake up not overwhelmed and freaking out\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes we can! I'll have a look later\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: We could do the beading and thresholds as well. Not hard to do, just fiddly.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Don’t be freaking out. This is meant to be nice fun stuff.\\
Well it’s fun once’s it’s done.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes I know. I guess I just need to get through the process\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: DIY like a host of other things tends to bring out some rather unpleasant flashbacks\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It certainly can be a thing that creates stress, arguments etc. a lot of the time something will go wrong. Just have to roll with it.\\
My brother did a great one last month. Putting up brackets on the wall in his garage. Didn’t realise he’d drilled all the way through the wall in kids play room and busted up the plaster on the wall they had just painted the week before :man-facepalming:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: And one job somehow either creates or makes 4 others\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh wow! That's a boo boo indeed\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How are the applications going?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: They are going. It has a very very annoying word form. It’s making me wonder if just filling it out is a test.\\
How was the nap?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh it's definitely a test!\\
But well done on getting started\\Nap was alright\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hope lasering goes ok. Dont forget drugs.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you. I'll be leaving in about 10, realised it's at 3.35. looking outside is not very inviting\\
Are you still working?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: yeah its nasty outside. I took a break but still working yeah. It not hard just painful\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I get that. Sending hugs\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: you must have had it already but WHY do i need to fill out info that is in my CV on this extra form :man-facepalming:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh it's constant. And cs has a completely different form in each dept too\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've got drugs!!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Woo well done. How many do you get?\\
Have you been lasered as well?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I only get a month's worth at a time.\\
Yup been dehaired too :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\How's it going at yours?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Think the main form is done. So that will do for now.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well done! :partying-face:\\
What's the plan for tonight?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not much. Rustle up some dinner. I might try and make some notes for the person statement and then some games with Matt.\\
What are you up to?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sounds like a nice chilled evening :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
Pottering around :face-with-tears-of-joy: some laundry, some dinner, and need to finish a hat\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Gotta love the pottering.\\
Maybe a bit of luck. My spin class is cancelled for tomorrow. A bit of a pain but I do at least get a lie in :grinning-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy: I potter a lot don't I?\\
Oh yay for lie in but I know you enjoy going. Why did they cancel?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You do like to potter :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
I just imagine you creeping around your flat like a ninja.\\No idea why it was cancelled.\\Will just have to get up and start the personal statement\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha. I wish! It's more like going from room to room forgetting what I was doing.\\
Ah well. Maybe you could go for a little walk to clear your mind ready to smash out the personal statement.\\I'm going to see Jenny in the morning and then home and job apps\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha,\\
If it’s a nicer day I might go for a walk. I’m at my parents in the afternoon to see my Aunt and Uncle.\\Sounds like a good day for you tomorrow.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Gotta keep on that 200 mile challenge :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Ah that's nice. Btw, I don't think my cookies are going to be of optimal quality this long. I worry your mum will offer them and they will be horrible :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll find out tomorrow but they might have been eaten already. They are still good today.\\
That 200 miles challenge may have been a mistake but we will see. Should get some miles in over centre parcs.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh you should definitely be able to loads of walking there. Is it like woodland or similar? I have no idea how centre parcs look like :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s normally set in or near woodlands but they are their own park. Lots of paths. All for bikes and buggies. Then they have their own complex with a big pool and sports courts.\\
All very clever so that you cannot leave and have to buy all their stuff\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that sounds quite cool! Will you have like an apartment or a lodge or something?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s some sort of lodge. I think it’s quite big. Hopefully means I can get some peace and quiet.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aw you'll have a lovely time :relieved-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done. That’s another cool multicolour one.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Only 7476636 left to make :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I like working with variegated yarn\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope your evening has been good. I'm just off to bed\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night, sleep well x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You beat me to it. Was just about to say the same to you. Hope you sleep better. I was looking at book cases. Might have a new idea for you. Just needs a bit more thought\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night. x.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ooooh intriguing. Thank you\\
\section*{Thursday $28\textsuperscript{th}$}
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00004414-GIF-2023-12-28-08-32-21.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning!!\\
How did you sleep?\\I think we're just grabbing a coffee and wandering around the rye x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Slept ok. Tried out the snoring strip. I’m sure there is someone somewhere who wakes up feeling refreshed and full of energy. I know I slept better but it never feels any different if it’s 6, 7 or 8 hours.\\
Not coffee from the boat hut? That stuff is awful. First and last one I bought there went in the bin. Nice to walk around the rye though.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We can both be nose strip buddies :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Well I'm never not exhausted so honestly I wouldn't know what it is to feel like that.\\Oh god definitely not coffee from there :face-screaming-in-fear: it's the worst one I've ever drank I think.\\What's the plan for you? Personal statement only?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Your snoring doesn’t keep me awake :face-with-tears-of-joy: although they are meant to improve sleep quality.\\
That’s pretty much the plan. About to hunt in the kitchen for some breakfast then get started on the statement. I know what I want to say just need to see if it will make sense on the page.\\Then going over to my parents.\\Have you had any thought on any timings \/ activities for us tomorrow?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no I haven't thought of anything. Do you have any suggestions? I won't be free until I think 5-5.30\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, that’s later than I’d thought.\\
I mean a couple of suggestions jump to mind as being pretty obvious :winking-face: but otherwise no.\\I don’t have anything to cook (I think) but I can acquire stuff if you wanted to eat at mine (was trying to avoid eating out)\\Only thought I did have was we could some up with a plan for you flat? Work out what you want to do, what the dependencies on each thing is so that multiple start points could be found. Or you could have a go at teaching me crochet.\\Open to suggestions.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, it would be nice to spend some time at yours ( I won't be able to stay over though :pensive-face:) we could do something.\\
We haven't done a "proper" date in a while :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: If you have actual cards you could teach me to play something or we could play a board game?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I thought a proper date was outside?\\
We can work up to you staying over sometime. It would be nice, I know we need to sort the fur beast. You might freeze to death :face-with-tears-of-joy: but the bed is bigger and there is no risk of other people hearing noise.\\I do have actual cards but I only know poker. I do have other card games we could try? There are also some other games I’ve wanted to try that I can get for tomorrow.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Any preference on food? I could keep it simple and pick up some steak or I could get some sort of Chinese “takeaway” deal from the supermarket\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha yes, proper date is outside. Just meant that we should plan one after you get back.\\
Yeah we can work up to that :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\Yeah we can try some other games or you can teach me poker. I don't know any card games.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah we can do steaks. Hopefully there's nothing that will trigger my tummy :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Wait, Boxing Day must have counted as a double date then :squinting-face-with-tongue:\\
We can definitely plan some for next week. Maybe something over a lunch as outside is much easier when it isn’t dark.\\I’ll get the card games and we can have a play around and see what ones are fun. I’ll get some steaks then. They didn’t do anything last time so fingers crossed :crossed-fingers:\\Strange place for a bruise. You can tell people it’s a sex one of you like :face-with-tears-of-joy: but my guess would be hip thrusts or squats.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, yes it must have been!\\
If you're alright with it I was thinking about asking Michelle and Adrian if they wanted to go for dinner with us?\\Brilliant, thank you! I can bring myself some veg :beaming-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\I know! It must be from the gym but god knows how\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Double dates are always fun so yes to that.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: \url{https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGeY8DtVt/}\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Noted.\\
Your biscuits\/ cakes went down well. They are all gone now.\\Any luck with jobs?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah brilliant!\\
How has your afternoon been?\\Not really. Having a big brain fog day so I'm just focusing on looking for what is around and saving what I'd like to apply for\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Afternoon been ok. Was nice seeing my aunt and uncle but the kids spike my anxiety something awful. Just on edge waiting for an argument or tears. Fortunately wasn’t any but the conversation quality is always low with the kids around.\\
That is still progress. Did you find any that you like the look of?\\How was Jenny?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah glad you had a good time.\\
Yeah, I get that. You kind of expect them to kick off at some point.\\I found a couple on LinkedIn in learning and development that I saved.\\Jenny is good. Was really nice to catch up with her.\\Has everyone gone home now?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: People were leaving when I left. Just finished up dinner.\\
That’s good you found stuff to apply for.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh for some reason I thought you were meeting at yours.\\
What's the plan for the evening?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh god. With the children! My house is not safe for them. Especially as they have no issue going around everywhere.\\
Well I hadn’t planned for the afternoon to take as long as It did. So I was going to try and rewrite the garbage I wrote this morning. That will wait till tomorrow. Will be playing some games instead.\\You doing anything? Got another hat done?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: First drafts are always the worst. Fresh eyes and rested head will help tomorrow (also I'm sure it's slightly better than you think)\\
Games are good. Are you playing with Matt?\\I'm in a bit of a funny mood, probably because of the fuzzy head so just going to have a chilled one.\\Hats are pretty much done now, just finishing touches. And will have to get the yarn for Lee's one at some point.\\Did you want a hat?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah playing with Matt. Hopefully he a little more awake today. Matt refuses to recognise if he’s tired or just having an off day and tries to play anyway :man-facepalming:\\
I think some of what I’ve written is ok but I tried to write a nice and concise bit about a career summary. Trying to highlight the key factors and it’s a full page of gibberish. The email I sent out to the supervisors has a much better version.\\Some day you just need to chill and wait till tomorrow. Frustrating but sometimes the best approach.\\I’d certainly take a hat but I do have quite a few already. So don’t feel obligated if other people are waiting.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah hopefully it is fun for you. Will be nice to unwind.\\
I have the same problem with personal statements. You can tidy it up tomorrow.\\Yeah, but I've done a lot of that lately haven't I?\\Well I was more thinking it would be a cute thing, rather than necessary :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\You okay apart from being oversocialised with kiddos?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well you are meant to be relaxing. I believe even the doctor told you to…\\
It would be cute. I just didn’t \/ don’t want you to feel any pressure in making one.\\I’m ok. I’ve got a very low grade headache and the last of this cough hasn’t gone. People are talking about a 100 day cough. I do not have time for that. I think (know) I’m worried about this application. I know I’ll get it done but it’s the implications of not being successful. Also would be better if I hadn’t lost a week to being sick and if it have ditched the quantum mechanics faster. Just need to make sure I can get the next assignment done before I go to the US. Sort of want to fast forward to end of Jan. Then it all gets back to normal.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You know I'm not very good at that..\\
Well I kind of like doing nice things for you.\\100 day cough? Oh please no. Mine's getting worse too.\\I know you are. It's a massive thing and you want it to go well. Completely understandable.\\Is there any way at all I can help? I know there probably isn't but I'm here for whatever you need.\\P.S. I'm looking forward to seeing you tomorrow\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You’ll have to find a better way to relax. Vibrators :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
I know and I like it too. Just didn’t want to pressure you.\\Sorry you’re feeling worse. That’s no good. I think it must have been someone else as I think mine is coming back.\\I’ll get you to read it all and that will help loads.\\I’m looking forward to seeing you as well. 2 games have already arrived. I might get a 3rd tomorrow when I buy dinner.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not in the mood for even that... Something's wrong :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
You wouldn't be pressuring me. I like when you do nice things for me too\\I think at this point we're just passing it to each other  back and forth.\\Oki, whatever you need :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\Oh wow! Thank you. But you didn't need to spend loads of monies. We can always entertain ourselves :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll be honest I have zero idea when you’re in the mood.\\
If it’s not pressuring then yes I would like a hat.\\We shouldn’t be able to pass it back and forth as we’d already have the immunity for it.\\The games will get used and they look fun. I’m sure we can entertain ourselves without them.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I didn't realise that, sorry. How can I make it better?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Any particular colour for the hat?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Let’s just say that other than the 2 times we were already in bed I had no idea.\\
It was a question I was going to ask you tomorrow. Something along the lines. How and when do you like sex to be initiated.\\Erm, I don’t know on colour. I like the multicolour but not sure that will suit me. The off yellow one was good.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Really?\\
It's a good question. To be honest, I think I've been more stressed than I even let on so my mind hasn't been in sexy mood loads, especially when I'm not feeling great which has been loads.\\The when is more along the lines of naturally. The how I guess is more nuanced. I like touching (not just my boob :face-with-tears-of-joy:) and kissing, bit of a foreplay and all..\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh the yellow one went to Jenny today. But I can have a look if I can find the yarn again if you'd like?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: yeah really. Although based on the rest of you message maybe I have been reading the mood right and not missing signals.\\
What do we need to do to help with the stress? As I would imagine if we bring that down you'll start to feel better (in some ways).\\I think it was yellow. I'll find it\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: This one\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well, there have been some signals :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Honestly I don't know. I would have thought that after all this time off I'd be less stressed. I mean, I am but only marginally. I think once the job stuff starts getting sorted I'd be better. I'm going to try this habit thing murder mates were talking about and make sure I'm taking care of myself better which will lead to less stress..  I'm stressed about being stressed.\\And to be honest, and I've told you this before, being with you does help :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that one is actually white and pastel. The light in my lounge is very warm :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You are going to have to point out these signals you speak off.  I have no idea. The only one I knew about was the time you text me in the Sunday I was sick.\\
I get the being stressed over being stressed and I can imagine that while not being at work does help a bit you then stress about the work not being done and what people might be thinking \/ saying. So it helps being off but not as much as it should.\\Yes 100\% what ever they said you should do. Rule \#1 - take care of yourself. You’ve got nearly 10 days to make a start.\\I’m glad I help. Still not sure how but I’m glad it does.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Still looks god though\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okaaay :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
I don't know what it is but it literally feels like my nervous system calms down ( hope that doesn't sound too weird).\\I know it's awkward for you to hear stuff like this but you are wonderful and I'll keep telling you until you believe me.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I actually might have some of those yarns left :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s not too weird. Again, I’m glad I help. Maybe I’m a calmer person that I thought. One of my special work skills is crisis management. I do think I see \/ think about thinks differently than most. I do think that a lot of people spend a lot of time worrying about the wrong things.\\
But there does have to be other things we can do to help you beyond me being in the same room\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: There have to be. I just can't think of any at this moment. We can have a brainstorm later :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Right I'm all snuggled in. Hope you sleep well\\
Night night x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Me to. Night. x.\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning!\\
Unfortunately I am up :face-with-tears-of-joy: didn't even need an alarm clock.\\Hope the PT session is good xx\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oof, 7am isn’t bad though.\\
How is the fuzziness today?\\Session was good. New PB on deadlift. 3x200kg\\Smashed it.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Still a bit fuzzy. Will see how the sesh with Steph and the massage go.\\
Oh wow. You absolutely smashed it! So impressed with how strong you are :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Will be kill or cure I think. Although a massage after the gym  might just turn into a snooze :grinning-face:\\
Thanks. I seem to be in this twice a year window of getting stronger. Very pleased to be up 20kg in only 2 weeks. Been a target for a long time. Still gotta get the bench target.\\Looking forward to seeing you later and hope you’re not too broken.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Do you need \/ want anything from Morrisons? I’ll be going there later to get dinner. Was going to do chips but will see if anything else looks interesting. Maybe  :dolphin: potatoes.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh it always turns into a snooze with Lyddi. She genuinely has healing hands.\\
You've done so so well :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\I look forward to seeing and squeezing you later too. And hope I'm not :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll definitely be wanting some veg but not sure what yet so I'll stop there on my way to you later.\\
Haha, dolphin potatoes :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\If they are too creamy I won't be able to eat them much but maybe a potato gratin? If they have like a little portion? Or I can pick them up later\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh I didn’t think about that on the :dolphin: and a good point.\\
I could always see if they have some sort of roasted veg thingy and or grab a bag of salad. Save you a trip.\\I’m going to the apple orchard to meet Toria for a drink this morning so I might try getting the steaks from the butchers there.\\Just seen this on insta \url{https://thecbdselection.co.uk/collections/home/products/copy-of-veritas-cbd-oil-3000mg-10-30ml-full-spectrum-cbd-oral-drops}\\Not sure if they could be any help to you?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't worry, I'll pop in the shop - I really don't know what I fancy veg wise (not roasted) so will have a mooch.\\
Oh nice! Enjoy the catch up :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\Ah thank you. I already have CBD gummies and they do sometimes help, takes the edge off. Just don't want to take them too much with the meds because they do knock me out\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh wow! Thank you.\\
It was good. She killed me.\\How was coffee with Toria?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, no point paying for an easy session.\\
Coffee was good. Toria isn’t doing as well as I thought she was.\\I kept forgetting to write it down. What is the free counselling service you just signed up for?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no! I'm sorry she's struggling. Anything we can do?\\
It's Buckinghamshire talking therapies\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not sure what we can do. Was trying to figure it out. Not helped that she has no idea why she is feeling lower and lower.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Could we take her out for dinner at some point?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I completely get the not knowing why. I often don't necessarily know why I'm so low\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Do you have a link? My Google foo is failing \url{https://www.oxfordhealth.nhs.uk/bucks-talking-therapies/} ?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m sure we can and I’d like us to anyway as a double date.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup that's the one\\
She's need to fill in the form to self refer\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I get it as well and it is strange. Therapist have that clever way of working it out. Already asked about the pill as any change in that can mess up all sorts of stuff.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Pill is horrendous for low moods if you're predisposed.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ooh I read about a study they did of creatine impact on depression. Apparently it helps\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: She has been on it forever but I k one if they change the chemistry it can change your personality. I put the pill down to one on many reasons why my marriage failed.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They do try to keep you on the same stuff as much as possible unless it doesn't work. But I have heard of loads of women having terrible hormonal changes\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It definitely seems to work in regards to what’s it made for but they only now seem to be looking at the behavioural changes associated with hormone levels.\\
Ive seen stories of people ending relationships once they stopped because they were attracted to fundamental different people on and off the pill.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: What time are you getting touched up?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah. About 5.30 I hope :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But the massage is at 3.15\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Steph put me on her stories :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :eyes::eyes::eyes::eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: ????\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just went off to look.\\
Great picture of you doing pull ups\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: She just sent me progress pics too :face-screaming-in-fear:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Going to share?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Noooooooo :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Why?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't knooow\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s a great reason :man-facepalming::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I mean it's not like you haven't seen me naked :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Holy crap. :fire::fire:\\
What’s the time difference? Such a definition change\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 8 weeks\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Wow\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I thought you were going to say 6 months or a year\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :smiling-face::smiling-face::smiling-face::face-blowing-a-kiss:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m going to have to up my game.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahahah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Remember 5 of those weeks were without work. Will have to see how it goes when I'm back\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you really had 5 weeks off? I thought it was 3 plus the school holiday\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 4 plus the holiday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not working clearly agrees with you.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Clearly\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just to win the lottery now\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep, anything is possible.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Massage overran! Will aim to get to you for 6 if that's okay xx\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That works. Looking forward to it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Me too. I dozed off :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Don’t forget to bring or take your drugs.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Do you need anything from the shop?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: All good thanks.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just in Morrisons\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Wooo\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Checking you got home ok?\\
Really enjoyed this evening.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You’re really great.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just walked through the door!\\
I had a really lovely time too. Thank you :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You're pretty amazing yourself, you know :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hope you have a fun tomorrow with the girls. I’m guessing they will all be drunk before lunch?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you.\\
Ooh definitely not, not booked in until 1.30 :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh right. For some reason I thought it was all starting at 11.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Noooo. Train is at like 12 something\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh you’re not taxi service then. That’s good at least.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm just going to drive myself to the station and probs pick Nicky up. That way I can just shoot off later when I want\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good plan. Always need an escape plan on a day \/ night out when drinking is involved.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I always have an escape plan on outings :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: In bed now.\\
Thank you again for cooking me a lovely dinner and even lovelier evening.\\I really like this, us.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night xx\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night. x.\\
\section*{Saturday $30\textsuperscript{th}$}
I really like this as well. x.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00004544-GIF-2023-12-30-08-18-11.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh :face-with-tears-of-joy: I can't lift my arms fully :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
I missed waking up with you too :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\Are you off to parkrun?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m going to give it a miss. Completely broken and very unexpected\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's probably sensible! You did heavy leg stuff yesterday\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: So what's the plan for the morning?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Packing mainly. I think I need more stuff than I should for only a few days. Will hit Starbucks for 10 to say hello to people. Then leave just after lunch. I might send you a draft of my personal statement\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I always overpack. Enough undies just in case I pee myself twice every day ( it has never happened)\\
Aw that's lovely, enjoy the coffee.\\Oh yes, please do. Will have a look at it over the weekend x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, I think a lot of people do that with clothes. Plus somehow assuming you’ll wear 3 outfits a day even thought it has never happened. It more the sports stuff and uni stuff. Gym, swimming, running and cycling gear.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh you are going to have so much fun. Only a little jealous :winking-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The offer was there for you to join :face-with-tears-of-joy: total trail by fire and would create the scenario from the paired question about have sex with other people in the house.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah. I knew you were going to say that :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'd prefer a much less pressured environment and maybe not meeting the whole fam at the same time. We can look into arranging something after you get back from the US if you want :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Much less pressure is better. It would be (will be) full on chaos at centre parcs and it’s too far away to come up for lunch or something.\\
We can sort something soon enough.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It would likely be a drink at either my place or my parents place\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Which one are you going to again?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We can do that :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: My “genius” idea for your living room based on getting black units is this\\
\url{https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/kallax-tv-bench-black-brown-10562090/}\#content\\Plus 3 of the 1x4 kallax units in black to make up the corner bookcase. Or maybe just 2 with one on each wall. Either way would then make a top plate to you don’t see a gap and the cat doesn’t fall in.\\One of the units can be wall mounted as well above the tv if needed. Then something on the right side of the TV.\\Currently all available for delivery in black\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: \url{https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/finnby-bookcase-black-10261129/}\\
Maybe for the right of the TV as it’s a bit thinner\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Elveden in Suffolk\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: \url{https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/kallax-shelving-unit-black-brown-40275846/}\#content in black\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Or maybe 3 of these. Window wall and either side of the tv unit\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you bubs. I'm really not a big fan of kallax though but I will have a look. I'm hoping for something with doors at least on the bottom half\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You can get doors for the kallax for the TV unit maybe. The bookcase idea might be better now I’ve thought of it as the kallax are quite big vs storage space for books\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :man-facepalming: they let you filter by colour\\
\url{https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/search/?q=bookcase&filters=f-colors%3A10139}\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll have a look :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Maybe this as the tv stand instead as you’d get more storage underneath \url{https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/p/kallax-shelving-unit-with-4-inserts-black-brown-s29278304/}\\
Would need to measure it all out. Maybe only 2 of the bookcases.\\Perhaps a small table in the very corner for a plants and then some sort of corner shelves rather than 2 bookcases butted up on the corner.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll stop now.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you for trying to help :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Trying! :crying-face: :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
As long as it is helping.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I mean. I'm a hard person to help :woman-shrugging-light-skin-tone: and you are trying your best to do so .\\
Are you done packing your 15 pairs of undies and 4 outfits per day?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll remember you said that :winking-face:\\
I’ve thrown it all on the bed so I can see if I remember anything between now and putting it in a bag.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I'm fully aware I'm weird and complicated :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Also I forgot my tupperware thing last night , even after we spoke about it :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: :fire::fire::fire: looking amazing as always. Enjoy the day.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you.\\
Drive safe xx\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Once again, your words. I like how weird you are and I can work out complicated. As long as complicated is consistent.\\
Yeah I saw this morning :man-facepalming: we can try again next week.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: My complicated is always consistent :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
How was the drive up? Did you get there all okay and settled in?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Drive was ok. Took a super weird route to get to the M25 and I left later than I wanted so arrived in the dark.\\
Just about settled in. The house is your temperature (freaking hot).\\How’s your day been?\\Drugs?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah glad you got there okay. Do you have your own room?\\
Haha, it's not my flat that's hot, it's me :face-blowing-a-kiss:\\It's been okay. Just got home and straight into cosies. I am shattered\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh yeah got my own room. No one would want to share with me :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Your home earlier than I would have though. I assume everyone else is completely drunk?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah. Nice!\\
They are merry, not really drunk drunk. Very reserved today :grinning-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\It was just too much for me, I'll be paying for it tomorrow.\\So what's the plan for you guys tonight?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well at least you don’t have anything to do tomorrow.\\
No idea on the plan. Kids are “asleep”. Think we might play some pool as we have a table or just a couple of drinks\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Was hoping to do gym and clean the flat :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Sounds like a nice chilled evening. Enjoy it. Don't think *too much about me :winking-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well you might still be able to manage that.\\
Should be a bit chilled.\\I’ll try. I like thinking about what we did on the sofa. Definitely want to repeat that.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Do you only ever think about me in the context of sex?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No I think about other times as well.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also there could have been more of the couch action if we didn't need to move upstairs :winking-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You made Steph’s story again.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okay. Just wondering\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think about you too\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m pretty sure it wasn’t meant that way but I read this as you being mad or upset that my thought was about sex.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I am not mad or upset!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You know I like to double check things, especially over text\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I was checking as well.\\
I said the time. I did like that evening we just spent on the sofa just talking but I also liked the time we spent yesterday.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know you’re different but you also know I’ve had mad experiences when I bring up sex. So it’s a big thing for me to be able to talk about it positively and in a fun way with someone. It certainly not something I expect every single day time we meet up. Which is hope was also obvious at this point.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's good that we check with each other. This way no vagueness and guessing :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: My turn in the pool table\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I do know that, and I'm really glad that you feel comfortable with me to talk about sex positively.\\
And I also absolutely know that it is not expected. You have been patient and understanding with all my ailments etc :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: and I appreciate you for it.\\I promise I wasn't asking that question in a negative way\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And now because it's over text I feel like I might have said something not right :grimacing-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You’ve not said anything wrong. Just the timing of your follow up question triggered an anxiety for me. Which I why I asked about it.\\
I always look forward to spending time with you and obviously want to do \/ have sex stuff with you (poorly worded). It’s the whole package.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm so sorry. I didn't mean to trigger an anxiety for you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I want to do the whole package with you too!\\
And we'll definitely have a couch replay :winking-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know you didn’t. You had no way of knowing and it’s a good thing for it to happen and me check.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll make sure to have all the paraphernalia in the lounge next time.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm glad we can talk about things so openly. I really like it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's the pool going? Are you winning?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Me too\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not well. I am rubbish. A couple of great shots paired with terrible shots.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, ah well. Hopefully at least you're having a nice time :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well I think the kids are finally asleep.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I thought you’d be asleep by now?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh crap I just realised the time :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: I am still coming down from being massively overstimulated for 8 hours straight, it's taking a while to unwind\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, I thought it would make you crash rather than keep you awake\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'd have thought so too. But too wired I guess\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just had such a good time then.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hmm?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: To be so wired. You must have had a good time.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aaaah. I did, but definitely overstimulated :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you take your drugs? I thought they’d have knocked you out a bit\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I did but really late. I'm going to head to bed now and hopefully I'll just drift off :crossed-fingers:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good luck. I’ll wish you good night then. x.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope you had a good night :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\section*{Sunday $31\textsuperscript{st}$}
Night night, sleep well xx\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00004628-GIF-2023-12-31-08-33-16.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Moorning! X\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I slept okay I think. But the DOMS :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: I huuurt\\
Oh no! I don't think you'll be having many lie ins on this trip!\\What's the plan for today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: DOMS is a good pain though. Well done. You still planning on hitting the gym?\\
I think lie ins might have died on this trip.\\No idea on the plan. We have laser shotgun shooting at 12 and the kids have some party thing in the afternoon. We have dinner booked somewhere but beyond that I don’t know.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No I don't think I'll manage today. I am beyond tired and in pain so will take it easy and go tomorrow.\\
Oh that sounds fun! Make sure you have some relaxing down time too :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: All you’ve got to do today is relax.\\
I’ll find somewhere to relax. I am not used to processing this much human speech and it’s even worse with children’s nonsense.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Relax and clean the flat!\\
I completely get what you mean! How's the weather? Maybe a little walk?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just about to go for a little bike ride. Your getting evils for still being awake :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nooo. He's being super cute. Enjoy the bike ride!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00004638-GIF-2023-12-31-11-11-34.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I di manage a nap :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: how was bike ride?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Given how far we have to go the bikes aren’t really needed u less your going for a specific bike ride but it was fun. The laser clay shooting is clever and fun.\\
Well done on getting a nap in. Hope it helped you feel a little bit better.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How far did you go?\\
Is all of this included or do you have to pay extra?\\Oh I'm glad you had fun at the laser shooting :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\I've just finished sorting my dresser drawer, chucked loads of socks and undies\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have no idea but I think I clocked 15 minutes over 2 rides :face-with-tears-of-joy:. Watch says 0 hours recovery.\\
Oh, it’s ALL extra except the pool. Very clever, money printing facility really.\\Well done. Always cathartic to throw stuff out. On my list to ditch a bunch of stuff. Does that mean you need new or that now you just have enough?\\Very happy to help pick out new undies :winking-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha... I have too many as is :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
But I don't have anything...coupley... So that's something we could definitely have a look for :winking-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: :eyes::eyes:a very enthusiastic yes. Maybe we need to have a lovehoney \/ Victoria secret wish lists\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh what a good idea! We should\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I might have a little look later then.  Could start to get expensive :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't get carried away :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh I will. You can reign it all in.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, ok. I'll be the sensible one for a change.\\
What have you done with your afternoon? Also how's the weather? It's been absolutely lashing it here\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Only a little bit of rain. After shooting it was quick lunch, sauna and hot tub. Just now having dinner.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: God you're living the life! :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Well jel. I still have two rooms to clean and hoover\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: \#rocknroll\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well you know. I had to relax before dinner. Jeepers it is overwhelming in the restaurants surrounded by children. Just on edge the whole time.\\
2 rooms :face-with-tears-of-joy: you only have 2 rooms plus a bathroom. Did you get it done?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh god it must be so loud :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
Well, bedroom, bathroom, lounge, kitchen... Yes, all done. Dusted and mopped, bed changed, everything. Now will have an everything bath and watch something.\\Are you going large tonight with the fam?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: What’s an everything bath?\\
Loud would be ok it’s the type of loud that gets me. Kids whining, the sound of dropping things, parents arguing. I can tell from my watch it spikes my heart rate.\\Oh yes, going full mental with the family. 3 of us our currently sat quietly in the living room while the children sound like they are being murdered in the hot tub.\\It feel much later than it really is and thanks the delightful children meaning that none of us slept last night I don’t know if we will make it to midnight. Will be have some bubbles though. Hopefully the kids can be asleep by 8 but I doubt it.\\What film?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's literally what it sounds like. Face mask, shaving, lotions and potions, the whole 9 yards.\\
Yeah I know what you mean. It gives me anxiety.\\Hahah, I hope they aren't.\\Yeah it feels like it's 10 o'clock.\\Oh I might open the non alc bubbles I have! Good idea!\\Oh not sure yet, still about 2 hours before I get there :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Quite different from my everything bath which is just a bath and that just includes doom scrolling and a drink.\\
Bubbles is a good idea and I know we have a good bottle.\\2 hours away? You’re planning a late night then.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s the processing of nonsense children speech that seems to max out my anxiety. For some reason it just puts me on alert.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, I bet!\\
I just fancy a pamper\\I mean, I'll probably just watch couple of episodes of bones :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm sure there is a study about it!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You certainly deserve a pamper.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m sure, no doubt linked to some sort of unknown trauma or old cave man flight or fight instinct\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Most probably\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s cool. Is that how you’d like to dress? Nails no. Choker yes.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not necessarily, but maybe. Just liked it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh did I tell you I've had a nude of myself painted a few years back?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :eyes::eyes::eyes::eyes::eyes:\\
Somehow you kept that quiet\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well, I did\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Do you have it in the flat?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I did have it up but took it down when Stuart was painting the flat and haven't put it back up (fuzzy brain)\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So the nail is already in the wall?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No no nail :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: just had it propped up on the dresser\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Even easier to get back up :eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You can help me put it up\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yes please\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Do you wanna see? I'm still so in love with it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Very much\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: image omitted\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :fire::fire:That’s awesome.  Not sure people would know it’s you unless you said but given I’ve seen the real deal you can tell.\\
How was it painted. From a photo or did you pose?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It was from a photo. Some of my friends had them done and I just loved how she paints so got one myself\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Photo you say :winking-face:\\
A very good artist. I really like the style.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've just had a look and I don't think she's painting anymore as her insta is gone\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Side stepped the photo comment. Well done :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Shame if she has stopped but it is very hard to be an artist, especially the last few years.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, I don't think I have it anymore to be honest\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Convenient :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll just have to snap a pic of the painting next time\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done. Why is it blue?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I would very much like to be asking for more pictures but as you can imagine. I am in completely the wrong setting to fully utilise anything you might send.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Bathbomb :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Don’t turn into a Smurf :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh well... I won't be taking any new ones today but I might find something in my phone?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :eyes::eyes::eyes: start hunting\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: This message was deleted.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: image omitted\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: A bit of a cards on the table message before the night runs away with me.\\
I’m a little disappointed I don’t get to spend new years with you and I know it’s a hard time of year for you.\\I’m really excited to start 2024 with you and I’m really looking forward to see where this all goes. I really like you. Im excited to spent time with you and learn more about you. So much more to learn than I already know and I like what I know so far.\\I really want to help you with your job search and transition to a new career. Want to help you with your flat and making it a nicer place for you.\\2023 was a bit of an odd year for me compared to the previous. Not really much happened and I didn’t really reach a lot of goals so I’m optimistic that 2024 will be better and even better with you in it.\\January is probably going to be a bit of a weird month time wise with me being away and then my procedure will all stop use spending a bit of time together. We will get through that and find a new rhythm. Proper dates etc.\\should all be a lot of fun.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Holy crap you deleted that picture fast :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You know I like cards on the table :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ridiculously stunning in that picture btw. You are gorgeous and I need to pay more attention \/ look again as I’m not sure I’ve seen 2 of those tattoos\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I would have loved to spend tonight with you. And I promise I'll explain why certain times of the year are hard for me. Today is the first anniversary of my father's death and I don't know how to feel so I kept myself busy.\\
BUT! I am very much excited to go into the next year with you. You came into my life in the weirdest time but I'm so grateful for it. I know you don't realise it even when I tell you but you've really helped :smiling-face-with-hearts: and I promise I'll let you help me (and will ask for it) going forward, flat, job or whatever else. I appreciate you so much for everything you do. You do so many little things that you probably don't even notice, but they are massive for me.\\I know I was scared in the beginning because I am set in my ways and find it hard to let someone in. But I want to let you in and I don't think I'm scared anymore. I am in this! And I reeally like you too.\\January will be January, we'll get through it. Looking forward to laying on your sofa and just talking, proper dates and everything in between xx\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aww, thanks. And yes, look more please :winking-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I knew about your dad but have no idea how to offer support. You’re allowed to feel any way you like. All of it is ok.\\
I know you will talk to me about stuff when you are ready and i look forward to it.\\I was very aware how scared you were. I was as well and I am  an in as well. Fuck yes. :grinning-face:\\I’m glad I help you. I like helping.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's a definite fuck Yes!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I bet yours is nicer :grinning-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: All relative but I do have good bubbles\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I bet! Enjoy\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you remember drugs today?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I did. Bang on 5pm :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done. Full on adulting. Starting the new year right.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know! Proud of myself\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also I refilled my pill box and this is the magnesium I take\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done.\\
I’ll get some of that to try out then.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I started looking \url{https://www.lovehoney.co.uk/lingerie/all/lace-wet-look/?prefn2=lingerieProductType&prefv2=Body&prefn1=size&prefv1=8}\\
There is a lot and all of it would look amazing on you.\\There is obvious nice stuff but I do like the idea of crotchless stuff as well.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: This is also proper expensive but *really* like the idea of me with the remote control \url{https://www.lovehoney.co.uk/sex-toys/love-eggs-jiggle-balls/vibrating-love-eggs/p/lovense-lush-3-app-controlled-rechargeable-love-egg-vibrator/a39154g82398.html}\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'd be up for it. Maybe we can save up for it :winking-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: There's some nice bits. I'd have to have a proper look. Just remember I am a comfy girly :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Some of it looks extremely comfortable :face-with-tears-of-joy: it doesn’t have to stay on very long.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Very much noted. Already starting to think of routes \/ walks we could do where I could use it.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahahah\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That wasn’t a no :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You always see the silver lining\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I try to find them.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Always look out for the glimmers!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It might be one of those fantasies \/ ideas that seems better in my head but it seems worth a try. Car journeys as well if you’re going to be a passenger. So many possibilities\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How would you be using your phone whilst driving????\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hmm good point. I’d have to set it up before setting off\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: There would be ways\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Probably much more dangerous if I’m using my phone as the passenger\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: At least I'm keeping you occupied\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh god definitely not doing that\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your evening?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s been ok. A little dull although it nice to spent time with the whole family. The fatigue really kicked in for everyone after dinner. So just sat around chatting a bit with some booze. We have all gone to bed now.\\
Did you watch a film?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh already in bed? Are you going to make it to midnight?\\
There are already fireworks here so Spuddles is already really freaked out.\\No I didn't :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: just watching Bones\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep in bed. I\\
Might make it to midnight. We will see.\\Aww, poor spud. I hate fireworks for this very reason.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s sound activated so will work against music.\\
Problem solved\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Me too. Otherwise I'd already be in bed , but he's going to lose his mind at 12\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha, of course you already researched that\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Will it help if the tv is loud?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I fix problems :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No. They are literally outside of the windows round here\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Aww, shadow was a nightmare. It seems to be the pressure change they sense.\\
I’ve read that your not meant to reassure them as it tells them\\They should be scared. Didn’t really help me\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh, but I can't do that. He's just a little babyyyy\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You’re not meant to completely ignore them either. Just try to direct them to do something else.\\
If you have the fireworks in tv as well can you convince him it’s the tv\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hasn't worked previously but can try again\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Might do something. Get the Alexa in the bedroom playing as well just to have more noise.\\
Such a pain you have to stay up when you don’t want to\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: reminds me of someone\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have no idea who :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\

\section*{Monday $01\textsuperscript{st}$}
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Happy New Year :partying-face: can't wait to see what's next for us :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: xx\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Happy new year. Me too. I\\
May of just had a little doze\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to bed now. It's been quite the display I watched from my window\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How is spud?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: A bit freaked out. Alternating between under the couch and next to me\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not too bad I guess. Hope he snaps out of it pretty quick.\\
Night. x.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Me too.\\
Night night, sleep well\\Already looking forward to seeing you when you get back x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00004763-GIF-2024-01-01-08-31-59.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: <attached: 00004764-GIF-2024-01-01-08-33-35.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning!\\
I'm up and getting ready for gym. But I am so tired and have a budding headache.\\You should sleep with an open window, might counteract the radiator?\\What's the plan for the first day of the year for you guys?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Window is locked open. I’m ground floor so don’t want it open while I’m asleep.\\
Headache is no good. Must be from all the booze yesterday :grinning-face:\\I think the plan so far is 10am run, maybe early lunch. Then pool and then I’m not sure. Might have to try and read some of my uni book. We will see.\\What are you planning on besides the gym and dreaming of me?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No one is going to steal you, don't worry. It's centre parcs :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
It's probably the sugar from the non alc drinks tbh.\\Another lovely day for you :smiling-face:\\Haha, not much apart from that. Going to do a food shop at some point\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: :face-with-tears-of-joy: not worries about people stealing me more stealing my stuff as I will not hear them.\\
Good shout, probably right about the sugar. I need to cut back I think on my sugar intake.\\Calm down on the excitement of the day. Are the supermarkets open today?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We can do all the better eating stuff together :smiling-face: it's easier.\\
That is a good question and I just checked. It's only the big ones like Tesco and Sainsbury's. Aldi and Lidl aren't\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It can be a bit easier. I just need to be consistent.  I just need to find a couple meals I can batch out for 6 of the 7 days and just stick with it.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Consistency is key.\\
This bloody ski erg is going to kill me.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You’re using the ski erg voluntarily!!!! Well done. It’s awful\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: So bloody cold in that gym today\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: BUT!!!\\
Squated my bodyweight and leg pressed double my bodyweight :partying-face::partying-face::partying-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: The gym seems to amplify the outside temperature.\\
That’s amazing well done. What’s that. Squat 60kg leg press 120kg :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\I’m guessing 75kg?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You're forgetting I'm sturdy :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 70 and 143\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Very nice. That my new overhead press target then\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahahahah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have you been for the run?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just got back. It was rough. Really struggled to breathe properly.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But you did it! Well done\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, got it done.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you done your shopping? Bath and nap to celebrate smashing the gym?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh god not yet :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: sat down. Will need some breakfast before I go because I am starving!\\
And yes, definitely a nap after I get back\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you having an early lunch now?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Erm, breakfast has been and gone. At most it’s brunch now.\\
Will be having an early lunch but not yet. Just sat in the suna.\\A well deserved nap.\\Have you started your well being app thingy you mentioned\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okay, I'm having porridge for brunch :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
God would love a sauna right about now.\\It's not really an app. Just a tick off list on my fridge. But yea!\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Even better if it’s a physical thing. Is it like a notepad?\\
Doesn’t the suna break you?\\It interesting how it ups the heart rate.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hot tub apparently does. But to be honest I haven't tried sauna in years so not really sure\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: 9k steps a day? That’s a lot. And gym 3 x a week?\\
You only just ticked breakfast then :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not that I expect you to have read it but did you see I emailed you?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I didn't! Let me check\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sorry, didn't see it come in. I'll have a read today\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The 9k works usually when I'm at work.\\
And the gym is gym and a workout - I'm doing the January yoga with Adrienne challenge so that will slot in there\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s a shame about the hot tub as they are fun but only for 30 minutes. We can just try and replace it with sitting outside around a fire.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I would love that :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: For some reason I have an issue with x steps a day being a challenge. I think it’s great if nothing else is being done. Like my parents should 100\% be doing 10k steps a day. But when you also do gym and other workouts i think it starts to stack a bit much. The rest days are so important. Which I didn’t used to believe. My strength has gone straight up since actually resting on days.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: There is also the silly idea that it’s fun to have sex in a hot tub but it’s just not true. Maybe starting something but the reality is less fun.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's just a nice to have - for my Garmin badge :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yeah, it's really not\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Achievement hunting can be good and bad\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't yuk my yumm :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I went for a little drive to the big Tesco's :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you survive shopping?\\
Just finished “swimming”.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I did. It was pleasantly quiet.\\
Why "swimming"?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s more of a water park than a pool. Rapids and slides etc. got that classic pool headache plus I was nearly sick on there cyclone ride. Much more violent than I remember. The coffee before was a mistake.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh noooo:face-screaming-in-fear: that would have closed down the park.\\
Are you having a good time though?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: At least that ride. I’m sure they have a protocol for it.\\
Parts of it are nice. The children  hurt my head. They do not eat normal meals yet always claim to be hungry and are allowed to graze in between meals. So surprise surprise they don’t eat meal. Constantly asking for stuff, mainly sweets or other things they no they aren’t allowed. Then followed by arguments and tears. All very draining. Dad and I have managed to steal a few moments of quiet and are at the house while everyone else is looking at light.\\Just a firm realisation of how much I like piece and quiet and a chill atmosphere. Just don’t need drama.\\Did you get a nap? How are you feeling today?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, you've pretty much just described children as a whole :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Yup, got one in but it was a late one so woke up about half hour ago.\\I think the busyness and socialisation is catching up with me. Definitely need a few slow days\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you socialise today?\\
You are meant to be relaxing and you’ve got all week now. Don’t have to worry about seeing me tomorrow.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not purposely. But there were people in the gym and the shop :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
I never worry about seeing you!\\When are you back btw?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know you don’t worry about it but at least it give you tomorrow to try and not see people. Although I guess there is a sweet spot. Some people will recharge you and some drain.\\
I’m back at some point on Wednesday. Probably going to leave after lunch but not 100\% sure yet.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: \url{https://www.booking.com/Share-iTLHab}\\
Just thinking and looking\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I can't see what you wanted me to - it just comes up with home page\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hmm, that just doesn’t work\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Although thinking about it Easter time would probably be better weather but was thinking it would be nice to find somewhere cosy for a little exploring sex weekend,\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha. Not to visit the zoo?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well yes, Chester would be to see the zoo\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: But if we bounce that to Easter then my other idea is valid\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Easter time would definitely be better\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And I guess by Easter we might be able to go out of season\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh you want to do earlier?.\\
The only other time is Feb half term for me\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s the dates I searched :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha brill\\
How long did you search for?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: About 2 minutes. Just had the thought to get an idea of pricing. Really to see if it was silly money per night or sensible\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No I mean how long to go away for :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, I was just looking 2 nights to do the zoo.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Really hadn’t overthought it too much\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That sounds good. I'll have to arrange babysitting\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That comes into it as well. Maybe we start with something somewhere in Feb and plan the zoo.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Weird question. When you were driving up, did you pass by any Tesco, Sainsbury's or Asda that you will passing by on the way back too?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not that I remember. What do you need?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah ok. The two chubby cubs have a new cookbook out and I've been to Tesco and Sainsbury's today but it's sold out and Amazon is so much more expensive\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What’s the price difference to Amazon?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Like £9 I think\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ouch, that is bad.\\
You done drugs today? And water?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes and yes!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But still have the headache and pills are not shifting it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your evening?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Boo on the headache. Not enough electrolytes? Or just body being crap. Could be delayed tiredness from you late night rave.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Evenings been ok. Nice to have some time with my Dad and great to have some quiet.\\
It’s a shame that the food quality vs price here is proper crap.\\Did you get a bath in?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think just body being crap. And I haven't been sleeping well as is\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Boo again. Melatonin? Is it a body or brain issue do you think?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: As in stress\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: For the brain\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Glad you getting some time with dad. What's everyone else up to?\\
I can't have a bath everyday :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: the electric bill's already ruining me as is :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't think I can get it here without prescription, can I?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Probably too\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah you can get it but guess you can get stronger stuff from the doctor. It’s on Amazon.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: They just had dinner at the house while the children  were here and putting the children to sleep. Well. They were asleep but one has just got back up :man-facepalming:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I'll have a look. Thank you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully the sprogs are fast asleep and you've been enjoying your evening\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you missing me yet? :winking-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: They might be alseep now but that wasn’t true 10 minutes ago. It’s full :man-facepalming:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yet!!!!!!!\\
I was missing you ages ago.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: you are having no quiet time\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well how would I know?! You haven't said\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Noted but I did say I wished I’d have spent last night with you.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Correct, I can count the quiet time in single digit hours since Saturday\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know you did :smiling-face: but you know also that I am rubbish with any hints or signals and have to have most things spelled out :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m not really sure how I could spell out more that I’d wish I was spending time with you vs what I was doing at the time.\\
I am trying to get better.\\Something I need to get past is that in the past when I have said nice things they have then immediately been thrown back in my face as a negative.\\Again, I know you’re different but the immediate fear is that me trying to be nice will result in a negative thing happening.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: BTW - I like you.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You could say " I miss your face" :face-blowing-a-kiss: because I do miss your face.\\
Practice makes perfect, so feel free to tell me all the nice things.\\I know you are trying to get better at this and I get that there's past trauma with things. The only thing we can do is try\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: P.S. I like you too\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I miss your face\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I miss your touch\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :smiling-face-with-hearts::smiling-face-with-hearts::smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm off to bed now. Hope you managed some chill time this evening\\
Night night, sleep well x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah got some chill time. I’m just in bed myself.\\
Night. x.\\We need to plan when we are seeing each other this week.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We do! I was thinking maybe Wednesday if you feel up for it. Or Thursday\/Friday?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yes :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Wednesday should work. I’m planning on leaving here after lunch. Thursday I’m meant to be busy in the evening for a couple of hours. Friday is yes.\\
Do need to do some work at some point.\\Maybe a possiblity to stay at someone’s place Friday night?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've got a catch up with my neighbours Thursday evening.\\
We talked about doing an outside date so maybe we could do that? And sleepover on Friday sounds good\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: So maybe Wednesday evening. Maybe something day time Thursday and then Friday afternoon. Or we drop Thursday. Sunday is an option as well unless you need the day for school prep.\\
It might be a bit damp \/ cold for\\Sex outside but we can find something to do outside :grinning-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sounds good.\\
Sunday I have the vision board workshop and then will need some time to get ready for Monday.\\When are you leaving on Saturday?\\I also need a day to do some work :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Let's firm up tomorrow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night. x. Again :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not sure on times yet but after lunch I think and then should be home lunch time on Sunday\\
\section*{Tuesday $02\textsuperscript{nd}$}
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00004887-GIF-2024-01-02-08-03-33.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning! I am up and kept waking up all night:woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
Ooh that sounds fun! Hope you have a good time x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s no good. Feels like your sleep has been off more than usual over the last week or so?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah. I think it might have something to do with me going back next week :grimacing-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I was thinking the same thing.\\
For me I always used to have terrible sleep the night before I had to drive to a client. Mind was racing about what had to be done and things had to remember. I found it all stopped once I started physically writing down some short notes on what I needed to remember and any other thoughts.\\Then I wasn’t worried about forgetting them. <This message was edited>\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I can't\/don't want to do work yet. I'm more and more resentful of the fact that it is expected of us during our time off.\\
I will do some Fri\/sat but :confused-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I get that. If you’re always working you never get time off so can never switch off. Matches with the unmovable ness of deadlines.  Not conducive to a good long term work environment.\\
I wasn’t suggesting that you did any work. Just throw down a few notes on what you will do once you start.\\All not very fair if not doing work because your waiting then messes your sleep because your brain is worrying about the work hours haven’t started yet which then makes you feel worse.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I will get to it :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also, cookbook has been reduced on Amazon so I managed to get it :beaming-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh nice.\\
What’s your master plan for today other than adding that new habit I sent you on insta :winking-face:\\You doing any job hunting?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes!\\
Well I did a fancy hair mask last night so need to wash that off. Just had breakfast and definitely job hunting today.\\And yoga!\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What's in store for you after squash?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Btw, I'll be making the soup today so I can drop you off some tomorrow :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Fancy.\\
Not sure of the plan after squash. Lunch and back in the pool I think.\\Soup is good. Thank you :grinning-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm not jealous at all :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You’re forgetting the chaos that comes with it all.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know I know. But still it's nice isn't it?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Pockets of nice. High stress and I have a stupid amount of work I should be doing instead\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know what you mean. Hope you're still managing to enjoy the good bits\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: A friend of mine came up with a phrase. Fun to faff ratio.\\
This has a much to high faff number.\\Squash has been fun for the few games we played but the kids have had 4 tears, 3 tantrums and if they would listen for 10 seconds they would have had more fun.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
They are kids. That's what they do :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, they are just all so ungrateful. I know I would have been the same.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Again, that's just how they are. Neurologically their consequence brain bit doesn't even develop until they are 16ish, and frontal lobe doesn't finish developing until 25 :woman-shrugging-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's still annoying but I keep reminding myself this while dealing with tweens and teens . Smaller ones are even worse which is why I never went into primary teaching\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Primary teaching is like day care now. I don’t understand how some kids start primary who cannot use the toilet (minus disabled obviously)\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Slightly odd question.\\
What’s your notice period for teaching?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Also I really liked your answer to todays paired question :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The friend that just had the preemie baby is a primary teacher and the horror stories she tell me :exploding-head:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not odd.\\
Hand in before 28th Feb to leave 30 April.\\Before 31 May to leave 31 August\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: So is the earliest you could finish the 30th April then?\\
For some reason I thought you could finish at Feb half term\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah 30 April\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's ridiculous\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Wow, that’s worse than what mine was.\\
Obviously needs a bigger not text conversation but seems a no brainer to hand in this term and finish end of April\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I cannot hand it in with nothing to go into. I just can't - especially seeing that there are not million things out there that match what I need to earn and that I've had one interview out of 10 applications. I think I would be in a perpetual state of panic attack\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: 10\% return  rate is good. And 8 weeks to find something. All doable. Will pick up now it’s the new year.\\
I get not wanting to hand in before finding something but logically it would be impossible for you not to find a job before May.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: About to go in hot tub so will msg later\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you have breakfast and other mindful listings?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hard life :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well that's what I thought last year and here we are :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You updated it then. Well done.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Someone has to do it.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well, it all starts from now. Always was a nightmare trying to hire in December.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Any thoughts on tomorrow? I’m pretty sure I don’t have any food so need to get something. If I wasn’t see you I was probably going to be easy and get McDonalds but I’m open to thought. I’d like to try and get my Christmas decorations down. Not sure if you’d like to help or not. Plus there’s the chance of you getting touched up at some point :winking-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think I’ll be home about 5\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've been doing practice tests for the verbal and numerical reasoning and judgement :exploding-head: brain is mush but got to get them done\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well I will be bringing the soup. I was thinking about making fajitas tomorrow so can bring stuff to yours and do them there? And I can help with the decs\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Could come round around 6 to give you a chance to get yourself sorted?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ouch, are these part of job applications or did you you just think it would be fun to hurt yourself?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good plan and 6 works. Can update you with better timings once I know.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You ok?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00004938-GIF-2024-01-02-14-15-08.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Very much part of the application. If I don't pass even one that's it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Let me know what you want on fajitas though. I'm expecting no peppers etc?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah just focused on the work stuff\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Urgh. That’s tough.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Erm, meat and sauce :grinning-face: maybe cheese. I do have a whole thing of seasoning.\\
Maybe rice, could add some peas and carrots that I have in the freezer.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok good. I’ll leave you alone for a bit then. Asked as I expected some sort of comment from my “touched up” statement.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm not sure about rice... I was fancying fries?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've had a look at your personal statement.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I will send it back but please don't take anything personally - I went brutal\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have the oven chips we had last week or do you mean actual fries?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thank you. Brutal is good. I can have a cry about it tomorrow or Thursday :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Frieees. I've got some salt an pepper ones I can bring?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've just finished the numerical test. It was never ending, honestly. If I pass this one, only the judgment one to go\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Great\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Does it tell you if you pass?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes it doesn't let you through to the next one otherwise\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s something at least. Are these for government jobs? I’m hoping it gives you access to a whole bunch and you don’t have to repeat the tests each time.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you got anymore friends you can hit up? Knowing someone bypasses all of the first stage.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: This doesn't work in civil service at all\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's for that tax specialist programme. Took me all bloody day. My brain is absolutely fried. I was hoping to do more than one today but honestly I've been sitting at my desk since like 11\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Aww, well done for getting it done though. Does it at least log this against your account for future applications?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Mega corps it works and they do same benefits as government\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The numerical and verbal yes\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How did I only scored better than 43\% of test takers on the verbal, but better than 80\% on numerical and better than 90\% on judgment\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You keep saying. But who gives 27\% pension?\\
But honestly haven't seen any jobs I like or am qualified for yet\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I smashed out 3 apps\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Without seeing the test I have no idea and in the nicest possible way I don’t want to take the test :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Pension would be the one that isn’t that high but earning would be higher so you could put more in and or start a different investment engine.\\
Or, big brain idea. Don’t live past 70.\\My pension is absolute crap.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done. Absolutely smashing it.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Also\\
I miss your face. x x x\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And second question to above. Who the fuck is Bill?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Awwww\\
Miss your face too x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well this hurts. Bill is irrelevant.\\
Not clear if Jane is going to take holiday. Based on the information there the answer is false as she cannot do the lunch one.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I said that\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hopefully you get something positive back\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've had the feedback but it's very much just the percentages. This is just step one of 5 I think :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The other two were much easier. Pretty much the same job with slightly different title\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I just did the yoga and realised my mat is shit on the new floors :loudly-crying-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well here Hoping for an interview at least. It’s all much easier once you get past the computer and speak to someone. Given what you said on my birthday hopefully they are looking for people and it not an advert that then goes to an internal person.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, what happens. Do you need one that sticks better?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I need a more cushioned one. This one is brilliantly non slip and I love it but it is thin and not comfortable\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Add one to the birthday list.\\
Have you done drugs?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't have a bday list :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I have. Bang on 5\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What have you been\/are up to?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Start one\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Had a low grade headache all day. Think I haven’t drunk enough and not had any vitamins since being here.\\
I had hoped for an afternoon of piece but my brother and co came back. So trying to do some work was pretty much impossible. Uni work was interesting but the math didn’t make a lot of sense. Which is very irritating.\\Then we had dinner at an Italian place. All overpriced. Back at the house now. Mark (brother) is trying to put kids to bed. Which means the whole house is waiting for the kids to be asleep. Then we might play a game.\\Guessing you just relaxing for the rest of the day?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not sure if these would be a gimmick but thought this might be good for you\\
\url{https://www.formeshaker.com/}\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh boo. Maybe I should give you an empty page from my habit tracker :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
It must a pricey week for your fam. Esp your brother, trying to keep the kiddos entertained.\\Yeah just making soup and will wind down\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Looks lovely but wouldn't need one. I'm happy with my freebies :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I probably need to write a list and I do remember when I’m at home. Big one to get back on is water.\\
Oh the price ££££ is even more than I thought my mum had paid. All the dinners are between £130 - £200 for everyone.\\The lodge is about £1000 a day :eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Will cross that off the list then\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Jeezus Christ. That is soooo expensive :face-screaming-in-fear:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, it’s a lot more than I thought it was\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: In my mums mind it’s mostly been paid for by the interest on a loan for some money they lent my friend.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Free money then!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: With girl math yeah :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Maybe some stuff from this page on the bday list then\\
\url{https://www.lovehoney.co.uk/bondage/}\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That wasn’t a no :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm not sure I'd consider those as bday presents :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Fair, as they are probably more presents for me.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Exactly :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: But, my birthday has been and gone.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: There's always next year :smiling-face-with-halo:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s a looong time to wait. V day maybe. I should be back in action by then anyway.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You had a good birthday though didn't you?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I did\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's an option.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just a heads up, I'm not a big v day person\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, that funny. I’m not either.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Then that works\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Past stuff - had a whole issue with any sort of special occasion. Was always a problem or disappointment. So I’m conscious to improve that.\\
V day doesn’t need to be some huge big mega expensive meal out thingy but while I believe we should just nice things anyway, it’s also nice to have a bit of an excuse to do nice things for each other.\\V day is basically international have sex day.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm very much in the thought that you shouldn't just treat your partner on the one day a year. It should be always, not just a special occasion. I always felt that my previous partners super begrudgingly did something just because it was expected. A lovely dinner at home is all I need. Maybe a silly card\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Seems we have similar experience but with opposite results. Mine was that nothing would happen because it was expected as apposed to a normal day where nothing would happen because of a list of excuses.\\
I agree with your thoughts. Should be always.\\As I said, it nice to have an excuse to just up the game a little.\\As a side note. For cards I always try to go funny \/ rude ones. <This message was edited>\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know you've got a lot of stuff from the past still swirling around your head, but I really would like to help you deal with it somehow so it doesn't affect our relationship :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know and I was about to say how comfortable I am talking to you about all this stuff. I don’t want thing from the past effecting us either and as long as your ok with me pointing out things and struggles when they come up, like I have been then I think we will be fine.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm more than happy for you to point out things as they come up as long as you catch them and deal with them. That's what I learned to do with illogical and intrusive thoughts. The important bit is to tackle it :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Glad we are on the same page with this stuff. Illogical stuff just needs to be stamped out\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Step by step :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Had a chilled evening?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Relatively. I took over an hour for the kids to go to bed :man-facepalming:. So just watched some crap Tv. I’ve gone off to my room now.\\
It’s almost funny. You wait for the kids to go to sleep so you can do stuff but by the time they are asleep everyone is ruined.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: \#parenting :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m not sure if it’s better or worse but people watching and waking past people. All the family are having the same stuff. Kids having a fit or tantrum or crying. Adults snapping at each other over what the kids have done.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's a heightened time of the year. Kids have far less structure and they struggle with that so they play up. Add in sugar, overstimulation and tired parents and there you go\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And let's not forget the extra mental load the mothers are carrying, especially this time of year and tempera flare\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I must only see children and adults at heighten times of the year :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
It might help if my brother and his wife had some consistency in there approach. Vicki won’t tell the kids off and just directs to my brother. Drives my mum mad and then both of them give in instantly to Eleanor (daughter).\\I’m sure a trained professional would have a great time.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s all just a lot very hard work\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: For them, not me\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Although my heart rate is consistently 15bpm higher around everyone\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Parenting is a lot of hard work. And even though it's not for me I do understand why people have kids even though it is hard. The good bits definitely outweigh the bot so good ones for all of my friends\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I guess it has to.\\
As an outsider looking in. I don’t see it. The fun to faff ratio is all out of wack\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Everyday is such an up and down of emotion. Very hard.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's because you usually see them playing up, that's why\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Logic doesn’t work.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Very true\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, because they are not yet fully developed humans :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I am especially tuned in to conflict\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Probably because you kind of expected it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think I trained myself for a long time to expect it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Probably\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: At least things somewhat return to normal tomorrow (quiet)\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You'll love the solitary drive\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I really forget just how much I like controlling the noise around me\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Also really looking forward to seeing you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: There was a point on Saturday when background music was playing, people were talking in the pub, one of the girls was playing a song from her phone, another one was singing it and two others were having a conversation. I thought I was either going to run away or scream\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Me too :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh god. This drives me mad. It is everywhere here when you at any of the outside places.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hence why I was so overstimulated\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Need to find a way to under stimulate then.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah. Apparently something called somatic workout. Need to have a look into it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, there an actual thing?\\
I was just trying to find some of way of wording something about me stimulating you in some way :winking-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahahahahah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup there is an actual thing\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm off to bed.\\
Night night, sleep well xx\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night. x. You too. xx\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning! X\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Slept some.\\
I'm going for a walk with Becky this morning and then will potter around :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\What are you up to this morning?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Some doesn’t sound like a lot. You still worrying?\\
Oh nice. You looking at anymore job adverts?\\Not sure this morning. Maybe the pool before I head home. I’m still dead in one ear from the pool last time so not sure. Something will happen.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't know if I'm worrying per se. Insomnia is just part and parcel of fibro.\\
Haha, well I hope you have a good last morning.\\Drive carefully please, the storm was really bad here yesterday and there were so many trees down on roads everywhere\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Lots of confidence in that statement.\\
I know the fibro messes with the sleep. You just seem to be worse this week than the last few. Until of course I ruined it on Friday :grinning-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I always drive carefully\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah you know, ebs and flows. I'm rarely consistently well or not.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I wonder if that’s a habit to focus on. Improving sleep will improve everything.\\
Like the magnesium and melatonin.\\I’ve starting seeing a bunch of stuff on this hostage tape as well to help improve sleep.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hope your walks gone well. Just done first official run of the year. Ouch.\\
Really looking forward to seeing you later and hearing you scream :winking-face: (hopefully)\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Walk was good. Done just over 8k.\\
Well done on the run. How far did you go?\\I'm really looking forward to seeing you too :smiling-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh well done. That’s a proper march.\\
Only did 4km, quite slow. Can feel the Christmas fatigue when running.\\Other than staring at the clock waiting to see me what’s the afternoon plan. Nap bath jobs ?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have to start somewhere! Well done for doing it.\\
Oof, watch that you head doesn't get too big thinking like that :face-blowing-a-kiss:\\Some food, definitely a nap and who knows :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: On my way home now.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Made it home.\\
Means you could come over a bit early if you like?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah well done! How was the drive?\\
Uhhmmm... I haven't even had a shower or anything yet :face-with-tears-of-joy: as I've planned for 6.  I'll see how I go but probably will be the original time of okay?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Drive was pretty good. Better than going up. Just missed the school run.\\
Ha, I had assumed as much but wanted to throw the option out there. I was thinking 5 anyway not right now.\\What the anything beyond a shower that you need to do? Just curious.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah that's good!\\
Everything is taking me a while today so don't want to rush around :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh, that’s what I call a normal day :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Let me know how you get on. Any earlier than 6 is a bonus.\\Unless you are desperate to help me take down Christmas I was going to make a start. Probably won’t finish though.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll let you know :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
But do start without me and I'll help with the last bits\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Don’t forget drugs and food :red-heart:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Do you have cheese?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Cheddar yes\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Brill!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And parmesan\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Cheddar is perfect\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And pudding\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Awww\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: FYI, I don’t have milk. Just in case that’s important\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's not. But I'm stopping in Aldi to pick up some guacamole so do you want me to pick you up one?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh also I can be with you in the next half hour if that works?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That would be great. Thank you. Semi skimmed\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Brilliant. I’m just jumping in the shower.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just leaving Aldi\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yay\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm home!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you for a lovely evening :face-blowing-a-kiss:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00005094-GIF-2024-01-03-22-25-10.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh me too. Haven't had something like this happen to me for a while so just got blindsided. Hopefully magnesium and sleep will help!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's good this spending time together, isn't it :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s is, if we cut out the bit where your in agonising pain.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah, yeah, we'll cut that out :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: To be honest, I don't usually let people see me like that\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Bit difficult this time round as it happened while you were naked on top of me.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I mean, there are worst places :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But what I meant is that it just shows that I'm comfortable with you and I didn't rub to hide straight away\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I mean there was no way you were going to run anywhere.\\
But seriously, I did get that it means you’re comfortable around me. Which I like.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Off to bed now.\\
Night night, hope you sleep well xx\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll be off in a minute. Hope you sleep better. x x x.\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning xx\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've been up for a while but hoping I'm going to fall back asleep. Hip is still rotten.\\
Enjoy the spin class, hope it's not too horrible x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m sorry it still hurts. Any improvement or the same?\\
Hope you get back to sleep. It is far too early to be awake.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It is less than last night which is good!\\
Fat far too early :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Don’t forget to cancel the paired subscription thing. We can just do the free questions.\\
Hope you managed to get some more sleep.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I did ages ago, it was only a free 7 day trial.\\
I've had a little nap. How was spin?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done :star:\\
Spin was pretty good. The actual class was a bit dull but I did it all quite well plus some there are some newer people in there so it’s good to see the difference.\\Just dropped off the car and got back.\\I don’t know why I had the thought but I did. Have you tried or would a tens machine help you in any way?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Also I have shopping arriving tomorrow morning. So you need anything?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Another boring thought. I saw in the news about mortgage rates dropping. This was a 5 year fixed below 4\% but with a 60\% LTV.\\
Seems like the market might be dropping.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Glad the class was good :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
I do have a tens machine so will see if it makes any difference. I'm also going to try a bit of yoga to see if stretch helps\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm all good, but thank you :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh interesting.\\
I have 75\% LTV. But if anything changes my mortgage advisor will give me a call. I'm not due to switch till April so hopefully :crossed-fingers:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Stretching is always meant to help. Silly stretching :woman-gesturing-OK:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What time tomorrow?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hmmm, haven't really thought about it yet !\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 5ish?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: 5 works for me.\\
Need to talk through thoughts and plans for your birthday or at least starting ideas.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ooooh okay. Sounds intriguing\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: \url{https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGe2yfAPG/}\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: interesting\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Interesting?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: as in questions to answer\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aaaaah\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: ignoring the spelling mistakes\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Didn't even notice :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Soup is really good :star:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aww I'm glad you like it :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your day been?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Its been ok. Got the car back. Cost a bit more than I expected but at least it is done.\\
I've been working on my personal statement based on you notes. Not quite in tears :face-with-tears-of-joy:. All very helpful comments. I'm just about to send you the updated version.\\I completely get what you mean about the very first paragraph. Was trying to make the statement a bit chatty and I have the problem of not knowing who will read it. So I think the first paragraph either needs to go completely or be a more generic into just stating what the statement is for.\\About to start my tax return as the statement has just been way TOO much fun.\\What about you? Are you feeling any better?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Cars always do that :face-with-rolling-eyes:\\
I'm glad I haven't completely destroyed you with those, I felt I was too harsh but I've read loads of statements for unis so have a feeling for them (also, I've researched PhD ones)\\Agree with you on the first paragraph, it could probably completely go and it wouldn't hurt the statement.\\It will be read by admissions and programme leaders, both high up academically.\\Oh so much fun with tax returns. I remember those days and I wouldn't want them back. Hope it goes smoothly.\\I'm feeling a bit better but have had a massively lazy day which is not making me feel the best.\\Are you out with your friend Chris tonight?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: None of it was too harsh and better to be harsh now than after I submit it. Would be nice if I could write it to a named person but I guess it doesn't really matter.\\
I hate doing tax returns. At least these ones aren't as painful as when I was a landlord. Just a huge faff to get all the numbers.\\Glad your feeling a bit better. You are meant to be resting. It is allowed, although resting just because you hurt wasn't quite the idea.\\Chris cancelled. He has a date! Not a massive problem. I a bit knackered after getting up early. Can do some boring life admin and probably play games with Matt.\\Are you still out with neighbours?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ultimately it doesn't. And it will be read by more than one person anyway.\\
No it wasn't. Also gutted I didn't get to the gym. Do you have a sesh tomorrow? I might come stalk you :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\Oh nooo. But might be nice to have a quiet one. You haven't had that since last Thursday.\\Yup, just getting ready\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah I have a session in the morning, 7:30 if you want to stalk. It would have been pointless doing the gym when broken. Best case scenario you just get very frustrated. Worse case you hurt yourself more.\\
Are you going out out or over to a neighbours place?\\Is tomorrow\/ Saturday the last time of seeing you before I fly or are we sneaking in something next week?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okay I'll come if I'm up :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
And yes you are right. But because I'm more restless it bugs me more I guess.\\We're going to grab a dinner at Spindle.\\I hope not! I'd love to squeeze in at least a cup of tea and a cuddle next week before you go. I've got therapy on Monday at 6 and bookclub on Tuesday\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Maybe after therapy on Monday and\/or Wednesday then.\\
Also, book club? Nerd :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\Maybe Sunday as well but I know you have you vision board thing and school the next day.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Secondly, when have you not been awake at 7:30 :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Awake and ready! Awake possible but it can take me hours to slowly become human\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Or I could come from school to yours on Monday? And then Wednesday?\\
I'm going to keep Sunday to myself because I can already feel the anxiety rising so won't be in the right frame of mind \/ good company\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That works. We can work out food. Not sure how I can help you with the anxiety (I'd like to). Just make sure you dont spend Sunday making it all worse. All of this stuff works itself out and is never as bad as we think.\\
Yes I am well aware I need to use my own advise :grinning-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm not sure how you could either. I promise I'd tell you if I did.\\
I've decided not to do any work and then start fresh on Monday. I've got the resources so should not stress. And need to see where they are after the 4 weeks anyway\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: sounds like a good plan and by your own logic it means there is nothing to stress about. You can just have a nice chill day Sunday with a load of self care.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just had a look at the personal statement\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Content wise it is so much better ( as in cohesive and to the point whilst explaining everything well)\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: There are a few grammatical bits that need attention - would it be alright if I make corrections a little later\/tomorrow morning?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: absolutely fine. I didn't expect you to look at it today\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But honestly, well done on it! :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: thank you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Home now. How was your quiet evening?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Even quieter than I expected as Matt somehow forgot he was going out with his wife. :man-facepalming:.\\
Some good news. Seems my tax bill is nearly half what I thought it would be. So that was a nice surprise.\\How was your evening?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah, so what did you get up to?\\
Oh that is brilliant! Well done you!\\It was really lovely :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ve had a Crazy evening of watching TV :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Certainly was a nice surprise compared to when I normally hit the calculate button.\\Glad you had a good time.\\Did you take your drugs?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, what rock'n'roll life . What did you watch?\\
Yes I did. And on time :smiling-face-with-halo:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: A lot of  YouTube but also got into the new Reacher series.\\
Well done.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: All snuggled up in bed.\\
Hopefully will be up to see you in the morning.\\Night night, sleep well xx\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night. x.\\
\section*{Friday $05\textsuperscript{th}$}
Hope to see you in the morning.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00005162-GIF-2024-01-05-07-05-36.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm still in some pain but getting dressed so will see you in a bit :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That no fun (the pain) how does it compare to Wednesday?\\
See you in a bit :winking-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's definitely less than Wednesday but still radiating all over the place\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Obviously nice seeing you this morning.\\
Just checking it’s still ok to stay over tonight?\\Enjoy socialising.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Obviously nice seeing you too!\\
Of course it is. Look forward to seeing you later x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just wanted to double check.  x.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I had some of those chilli bites arrive in my shopping. Should I bring a bag with me tonight?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: This message was deleted.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh would love them but maybe not for the curry. We'll have them another time\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I had not but I’m not surprised. I can’t say I was looking forward to it this week given what the rain was like. It’s just misery with all the puddles plus my fear of slipping.\\
If I wasn’t going off to see my friend black park would probably be the best choice but this way we don’t have to rush tomorrow.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: How’s all the socialising going \/ gone?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah, the course is not safe.\\
But I was looking forward to it :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: ah well, at least no rush in the morning\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am exhausted :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, who would have guessed that outcome :face-with-tears-of-joy:. Was it fun though? You’ve still got time to get in a nap.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I still need to tidy and take a shower.\\
But yes, it was lovely\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Don’t tidy on my account. I’ve seen a cup on the side before :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Voice call, 1 min\\
\section*{Saturday $06\textsuperscript{th}$}
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I made it here.\\
Getting lunch now.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Glad you arrived safely.\\
Thank you again for last night and this morning.\\Hope you have a lovely time with your friends xx\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thank you for last night as well.\\
Have you managed to get any sleep?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not really, managed about 20mins :woman-shrugging-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh I’m sorry.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh don't worry lovely. It's not your fault, honestly. :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
How was lunch?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I kinda think some of it is my fault.\\
Lunch was really nice.\\Should be getting dinner soon.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No! It's not like you set out to keep me awake :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: honestly, please don't worry. I've researched more anti snoring implements - we can both look super sexy in bed.\\
I'm glad you're having a lovely time with your friends.\\I'm just getting ready for the bowling but honestly wish I was staying home\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I didn’t set out to keep you awake but thought I probably would. I didn’t think snoring after you were asleep would wake you.\\
What have you found?\\Your snoring doesn’t bother me as it doesn’t wake me up.\\It’s funny. We don’t see each other that much in a year but when we do it’s like we saw each other yesterday.\\Oh you’re still going. Thought you might skip. Hope you have fun though.\\Don’t forget drugs :red-heart:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah it's what it is. We'll figure it out somehow. I'd still rather snuggle you in the morning than not\\
I have friends like that and it's always brilliant catching up.\\Yeah, a few people pulled out already, and I have prepaid too. But not going to stay late.\\I'm taking them before I go :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Can certainly try the sprays. The device looks a bit odd.\\
I like the snuggles as well. We just need to actually find a way to sleep in the middle.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, we'll find a way.\\
Enjoy the dinner :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I bailed on the bowling. Really can't get myself out :disappointed-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Probably a good idea and nothing wrong with that.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :purple-heart:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Will have a quiet one and early bed. Hope you're having a good time :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good idea.\\
Yeah it’s been really nice. Just waiting for food.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Enjoy!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Off to bed now. Night night xx\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night. x. I just got home. Hope you sleep and feel better\\
\section*{Sunday $07\textsuperscript{th}$}
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning! X\\
Hope you slept well. Did you have a good night?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Morning. x.\\
Slept pretty well. I might have had a bit too much caffeine yesterday.\\Last night\/ yesterday afternoon was really fun. I’m sure I say it every time but need to try and see more often than we do. Going during the day was much better.\\Did you sleep better without an asthmatics wounded polar bear on the room?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I'm glad you enjoyed yourself.\\
When are you heading back?\\Yes, slept better but still was restless a bit\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m already at home. I came back last night. Glad you slept better. The restless bit is a pain.\\
When do you have you vision journey thingy?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh. I thought you said you were staying over. Sorry must have misheard.\\
I'm meeting the girls at 11 and then the workshop is at 1\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: There was a plan to stay over initially but as was there from 12:30 and we didn’t drink. it seemed better to just drive home. First night in a new place is always naff and I needed to reset a bit. I would have only woken up to drive home so it saves me a couple of hours this morning.\\
Where is it and who else are you going with?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I get that. I usually do that too.\\
Going with Patri and it's in the front room\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What's your plan for today?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Crazy plans today. Find suitcase and put stuff in the loft, maybe use the bike, really should do some work, couple of games and some TV.\\
You doing anything after your seminar (not sure what short name to use)?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Workshop :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Sounds like a good day though!\\Yes, yes I am. I'm going to be full of anxiety, getting stuff (and myself) ready for tomorrow :grimacing-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not very helpful but try not to worry too much. Tomorrow will be what it is and thinking more or less about it can’t make it better or worse.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Easy to say. Like when I tell you not to worry :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Exactly\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's out of date today, isn't it?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How different?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Fuckers. Will be frozen then\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Carrot peas and sweet potatoe\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Could I get some spring onion in mine?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: As well as? I can get some yeah.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes please :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I can do that. So, stir fry it is.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: BTW - I miss your face.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I miss your face too!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: how was the workshop?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's still very much going :smiling-face:\\
How's your day?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh right. Thought it was just an hour for some reason.\\
Days ok. Loft is done. Just playing some games.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No, it was supposed to be about 4. I just finished so heading home.\\
Ah well done on the loft!.\\That cold of mine is really picking up. Sore throat and all bunged up :upside-down-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s a good distraction for the day for you then.\\
Oh no! That completely bollox for that to be getting worse.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah it was. And it's good to put things down, it reminds me of priorities during the year.\\
Oh it's horrendous. Like I can't hear our if one ear\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s good to remember what’s important. It’s far too easy to get caught up in the day to day and then another year is done.\\
Urgh, that’s not good.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Bit late but checking you’ve done drugs and aren’t spiralling :cyclone:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahahah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup I've done drugs. And not spiraling just yet.\\
How's your afternoon been?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done on both.\\
I’m not sure where a Sunday goes. I had brunch, loft, games for 3 hours and it’s 7pm. Math don’t math but otherwise ok.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly, Sundays don't have enough hours\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And the weeks don’t have enough days :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nah, it's the weekends that are lacking\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well, I didn’t say the extra days had to be work.\\
If you didn’t see already I forgot the chicken. If you haven’t eaten it you could throw in the freezer.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Chicken's gone, made myself eat it yesterday. :grimacing-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh, easy dinner for you then. Glad it got used as it was good.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aw glad you liked it :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just checking timings. Am I seeing you tomorrow? I’ve got a PT session at 5pm and what time do you think on Wednesday?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: If I can leave work early enough I could be at yours just after 4 for a quick cuddle?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Wednesday is a twilight so won't be back until 5.45ish and will need a shower. Could we maybe meet at mine for 6.30?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That works.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Can meet at yours but thought I was cooking?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh god, yes. Sorry\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I could pick you up if that helps? And \/ or your welcome to shower to at mine.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No don't worry. I'm just usually absolutely knackered on Wednesdays. I'll shower at home and then come but won't be able to stay too late\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’d already assumed the 9pm :jack-o-lantern:.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: My shower is nice btw. Works and everything. High pressure. Just a fair bit of water marks due to the rocks that come out of the tap.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, I'm sure it is. But it would require me thinking about and packing everything from clothes to soap etc the night before and not forgetting to take it to work\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, I’m just assuming man spec stuff. Which is just shampoo and soap. Which I do also have but do realise you might have 19 different things.\\
Future stuff. A soap bag that’s ready to go or you just tell me what stuff is essential and I can get some here. Then you’d only need clothes. I also have towels, just in case you’d assumed I just had the one.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, I did not assume you had only the one :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
I won't be washing my hair but I do use only one sort of soap. And I don't think I have a soap bag to be honest.\\Maybe I can think about leaving couple bits at yours if coming from work will be a thing?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is what I was suggesting. Then you’d have the essential duplicates here if and when needed. I can even stretch to a toothbrush if needed.\\
A hang over from being a consultant is that I have a soap bag ready to go. Just easy to pick up.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Then the problem to solve is feeding the cat.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That is the big thing\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: All solvable\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh so we're at the leaving stuff at each other's places stage then?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: If we are talking about bathroom stuff then yeah. I’m not suggesting a full wardrobe :grinning-face:\\
Just seems sensible with toiletries and toothbrushes etc. we already use the same toothpaste.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: There are even more than I though \url{https://www.bestproductsreviews.co.uk/automatic-cat-feeder-wet-food?targetid=dsa-42444980453&matchtype=&device=m&campaignid=15548184439&creative=569168980234&adgroupid=131395587735&feeditemid=&loc-physical-ms=9046068&loc-interest-ms=&network=g&devicemodel=&placement=&keyword=$&target=&aceid=&adposition=&trackid=uk-all-top-11-2&mId=407-132-4411&trackOld=true&gad-source=1&gclid=Cj0KCQiAtOmsBhCnARIsAGPa5yZhNPE8Dv9AoBWrvtX6KjA-86iJAUmXziBFRZ3LWcSoVC63hqgnrr4aAoMoEALw-wcB}\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've got one. But I wouldn't want to leave wet food in it for over 12 hours\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm just checking. You know I like to know things\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know TV and film make a big deal about toothbrushes etc. just logic for me.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Righty. I'm in bed, set my alarm to 5.15 and hoping for at least some sleep.\\
Night night, sleep well xx\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Urgh, that is early.\\
\section*{Monday $08\textsuperscript{th}$}
I hope you sleep as well.\\Night. x.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00005274-GIF-2024-01-08-06-05-16.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x\\
Thank you :smiling-face-with-hearts: I like you too.\\Are you doing spin this morning?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah got spin this morning and I need to go to town later. Need a haircut and US money.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope the class is good :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good is relative. Lots of people and it was hard. So I guess it was good. :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00005279-GIF-2024-01-08-08-09-41.mp4>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How’s the day going?\\
Just got back from an unexpectedly expensive trip into town. Bought an extra pair of shoes :man-facepalming: did get student discount on my new trainers through.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's going. Just had a meeting with the head to ask for adjustments, will see what it brings.\\
What kind of trainers did you get?\\Btw, the cold is in full swing. One of my eyes is continuously leaking, can't hear out of one ear, sore throat and so congested.\\I'm really conscious about getting you ill before your trip - shall I still pop round?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also, it's snowing a little here\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Adjustments?\\
For some replacements for my now broken orange trim ones and walking boots.\\Oh that is no fun at all and much worse than I had. Can you take anything for it? I have tablets and gross cough liquid that worked. I know you said you don’t like the taste.\\I don’t want to be ill again, will no doubt get something on the plan anyway.\\Up to you. You can still pop round. Maybe we just keep a little distance. Can still have a hug.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I've been taking meds but it just seems to be ramping up.\\
No, this one is up to you popette - I understand if you prefer to leave it till Wednesday hoping I'll be through the worst\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hmm, maybe best to skip tonight then and go for Wednesday :crying-face:. If I wasn't going away I wouldn't worry. Just dont need to be spreading sickness around.\\
What are adjustments?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki - that is sensible\\
You know, like reasonable adjustments - employer has a duty of care to implement things that would make my working more accessible to be, especially if one has a disability\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I dislike being sensible sometimes.\\
I see, what did you ask for? I thought it was a specific teacher term. I dont imagine a scenario where they wouldn't do it otherwise you could launch you union at them.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just for basics but you'd be surprised how hard it is to get anything. I've been asking for 2 years now.\\
No duties, occy health, risk assessment for walking stick, I might lose my form though which is not great, to leave early of I'm not teaching last period\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: risk assessment for walking stick! Paper work can go to far. Risk - I beat the shit out of a child with it. Risk - I crawl along the floor because I dont have one. Multiple children trip over me and die. Therefore risk is better with than without.\\
crazy\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well it's not that easy\\
It's not about the kids, it's to protect me and I asked for it. It's irresponsible from them not having it for me\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: For some reason this stuff never is as easy as it should be.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: My point was that it was me asking for it as it needs to be done rather than school being difficult because of kids\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've just stopped to pick up some more meds and fruit and it's proper snow flurries :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
How's your day been? Do you have everything you need for US now?\\Also gutted I'm missing the new haircut\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Days been ok. I really didn't expect town to take so long. Seems like Monday morning is not quiet but I have been and am doing some work. So that's good.\\
I think I have everything for the US. Just a case of remembering and packing. Need to dig out another pair of gloves, got to do and then sort washing tomorrow. No doubt need to print off some more paperwork. Will be some mad panic tomorrow or Wednesday. Its not like I'm going to a strange place. Anything I forget and I get if needed.\\You'll see the new haircut on Wednesday at least. If it snows more than they think and I get stuck at the gym I'll be knocking on your door. I like snow but once it hits the road, Wycombe is a dangerous nightmare.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: <attached: 00005296-GIF-2024-01-08-16-29-30.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh did your trainer shopping take up time?\\
When I used to travel I used to call my grandma and we'd go through the packing list so I wouldn't forget anything :face-with-tears-of-joy: I can help if you need!\\It's not settling at all but you're always welcome :smiling-face-with-open-hands:\\Yeah, Wycombe is dangerous as is ( I don't think I've seen more than 3 indicators on my way back) but add snow and it's carnage.\\You're okay otherwise?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: All of it seemed to take ages. a lot of waiting. Waited a good 15 mins before even getting a hair cut then that takes 30minutes for some reason. Then shoe shopping took twice as long as I got boots, had to wait over 10 minutes in M\&S to get money because someone was late to work and the customer ahead of me was taking ages with a problem that couldn't even be solved. Somehow she had bought euro's but been given dollars and no one notices until her daughter (who is in Europe) opened the envelope to see that they are no euro's. Just how do you count out the wrong money when someone is watching you.\\
Thanks, might run through with you on Wednesday. As long as I have some clothes and something to do on the plane it will all be fine. Just a case of making sure it all fits in the case as I need bulky warm stuff.\\Indicators! WTF are they for :face-with-tears-of-joy: Its the small buss \/ taxi that drives like a lunatic as well.\\All good really. Slightly annoyed \/ worried by the amount of uni work I am behind on and worried i'll get more behind while away. There is no reason I should get more behind and I should be able to catch up but it still bothers me. Mainly because I can see what I should have done to not get behind. Would help if I was magically better at some of the maths. Plus I'd liked to have sent off my PhD applications but I haven't yet. They have taken as long as I thought which has compounded the getting behind.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah, everything takes twice as long as you'd expect.\\
Woow about the euros though :face-with-tears-of-joy: how did no one notice? And do you not check what you've got? And euros are so colourful\\I'll happily run through it with you - might tell you to pack 22 pairs of pants just in case though :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\How come you're behind? Were you supposed to be doing more over Xmas? Did I distract you?\\You'll be able to do some reading and notes on the plane? And maybe carve out some time during the weekdays if possible?\\I will have a look at the personal statement after therapy tonight so that will be ticked off. What else needs doing?\\Really wish I could help you with stuff\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You are not the reason I got behind.\\
Stupid quantum mechanics started it then being sick. Wanted to catch up over Christmas and just didn’t and now it all starts again.\\It all works out in the end. Would have helped if I’d have done the assignments better.\\You just cannot hit pause to catch up.\\Just off the the gym.\\Good luck with your therapy session.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have a good session. Talk later x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Drugs\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good luck with your session.\\
Got ruined at the gym :face-with-tears-of-joy: but was beaten by that Emily girl, if you’ve ever seen her before.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, did you. Hannah is trying to make sure you don't miss out when you're away :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Oh no, I don't know who that is? What did she beat you in?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think that what it is. A silly session before a break.\\
I’ve normally only seen her in the morning. Wears black and chews gum. She was just doing an insane hyrox style super set. Constant cardio \/ throwing weights around. She was beating everyone.\\Seen the email but not read it yet. Thank you.\\You done your session?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yes! She was there the other day! She is a machine!\\
No worries, happy to help in a small way. Just grammar changes - they are hot on those\\Yeah session was good, early days though .\\What's the plan for the rest of the evening?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just about to eat then should be playing some games.\\
Glad the session was good.\\You doing anything?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not much, just decompressing :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Seems like a good plan.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: All snuggled in bed with a cup of sleepy tea already. Hope you had a good time playing\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh nice. I’ll wish you good night then. Night. x.\\
Games are going ok.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night. Sleep well x\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning! I slept some.\\
How about you?\\Spin this morning?\\Oh boo, I expected by how cold it was yesterday. One of my least favourite things\\Hope you have a good day xx\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Slept ok but had to get up on the night which is rare.\\
Yep, spin again. I do get a lie in tomorrow.\\My car wasn’t frozen :grinning-face:\\I hope you do to.\\You got this. x.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Neither was mine :partying-face:\\
Enjoy the class!\\X\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Class was good. A good level of hatred in the class :grinning-face:\\
Hope you have a good day. x x x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: \url{https://symphonyband.co.uk/products/headphones?utm-source=Facebook&utm-medium=cpc&utm-campaign=UK+CBO+2+-+Open+-+A%2B+Campaign&utm-content=UK+CBO+2+-+Open+-+A%2B+Ad+set&utm-term=sb+n42.1&fbclid=PAAabAu25F2bL1TnTJsZE136W9kavhnMPH27ibXdMetjkdDdzABBVtsoUcrGk-aem-Ac14Oy0zDC92Cw0ksL0eRIrbcFPwPNfL3fG56v-NYIgumLxKyWup6OXb9mLzCTq2I3KryfdU5-hZowsn8GPVacih&campaign-id=120204634248890481&ad-id=120204634248920481}\\
Could be an idea?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, good level of hatred.\\
How's your day going?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't think it would make much difference to wearing ear plugs except ruin my hair :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Days going ok. Did just lose an hour trying to get some code to work only to find it won’t work on windows :man-facepalming: stupid open source people and their hatred of Microsoft.\\
Should at least get what I want done today.\\How’s the cold? And the day?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Worth a thought. Could have it play white noise.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh isn't code just wonderful? But glad you'll manage to get what you need done.\\
The cold is unbelievable. My head feels underwater and my nose is red raw :loudly-crying-face:\\The day was alright but full on\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sooooo much fun writing code :face-with-tears-of-joy: Actually writing it when you think you know what your doing is great but just trying to get stuff working that should already work when it doesn't, makes you want to hit a wall.\\
Aww, that's rubbish. I think I have some fancy tissues with the balm if you like? Are you still taking drugs for it to at least hide some of the symptoms?\\Guessing your home now? Just book club and relaxing for the rest of the day?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I remember those feelings, not too fondly :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
At this point, I don't think wiping with a cloud soft magic would help.\\Yeah, I'm still taking drugs, just doesn't seem to shake it .\\That's pretty much it. Just the book club is at 7.30 so it will be a later one tonight.\\What's your plan tonight?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I dont mind code going wrong when its your own fault. I'd rather it didn't but its just part of it but when you cannot get stuff even running it is just pain. Doesn't help that i'm a bit out of practice. This stuff is much easier if you do it multiple times a week. Like anything I guess. This last bit i'm working on feels like the easiest but that just has to be because the brain is remembering coding stuffs.\\
I'm sorry its not getting much if any better. Its just bollox being sick enough to work. Maybe once I get back from the US there will be a day were both of us *aren't* sick with some sort of low level plague.\\How long is book club?\\I've got a tutorial but im not sure about attending as I haven't yet read the chapter. So not sure if it will help or hinder me. I can always watch the recording once I have read the chapter. Then probably some games with Matt. Nothing crazy.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm not sure to be honest, this is the first one I'm going to but hopefully will be home around 9.30.\\
Hmm, could you read a little beforehand? Might be a good way to start feeling less behind on things, especially before you go?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh its an in person book club thingy. I, again, thought it was online.\\
Some of what I've been doing today is relevant to the talk. All depends if its a talky one or if we are meant to interact. I'll probably have it on and can do it again on Monday if needed.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup yup. Going to Patri's for it.\\
Ah I'm that case you'll be fine. I'm sure you could say your mic's not working :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: might be good just to have an idea what's it about\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I've got no problem talking to the people if needed. I'm very quick to say "Not read it" or "I have no idea how any of this works". That's easy :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well there you go! You should do it the. :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Eeey well done!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: the real trick I have to do is describe how my changes make a difference :man-shrugging:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well at least the first bit is done!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: yeah and it has the most marks out of the question.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's good!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: DRUGS :grinning-face:\\
have fun book reading\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I have taken them ages ago :face-with-tears-of-joy: but thank you.\\
The book has been read, now will be discussed\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Enjoy. The tutorial is really good. Thank you for the push to attend.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Also, I miss your face and I like you :winking-face: <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm just back at the car...  I don't know how time went :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone::woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I like you and miss your face too :face-blowing-a-kiss:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Whoops. Too busy having fun and chatting?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah, it was lovely\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just home and straight to bed. Did you have a good evening?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah it was fun and the tutorial was good\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night. x.\\
Sleep fast :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night, sleep well xx\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What did you do?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: the tutorial and then games. Matt was *not* on form but we managed one win at least. A lot of floundering and generally messing it up :man-facepalming: but that was also me as well\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm glad you had a good evening. Look forward to seeing you tomorrow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Me too.\\
Get some sleep. Well actually get a lot of sleep but you know.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to try :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Eyes shut, turn off brain. :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: If it wasn’t super late and you weren’t sick I’d suggest vibrator to help you sleep.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ha, well it's both of those things so my mind is definitely not on that :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Would relax the body though.\\
Phone down!\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm trying\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning :smiling-face:\\
I've got very little of it :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\How are you today? What's your plan?\\Xx\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh dear. I thought that might be the case.\\
I’m ok, not been up long and still in bed. So would be much better if you were here in it:smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\Plan for today is a bit all over the place. Need to pack, update my PhD application with feedback, by parents are coming over in the afternoon, change the bed so it’s fresh when I get back. Oh and this amazing person I really like is coming over for dinner.\\Have you updated one of your lesson plans to be a practice exam so you can have a nap :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Busy day for you! Make a list :smiling-face:\\
Hope it's a good one xx\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Personal statement updated. My god does it take ages. Have sent you what I hope is the final version. Hope the day is going ok.\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thanks. Didn’t mean you had to read it today.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, it's done now :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to warn you now. I already don't have any brain left and still so ill :grinning-face-with-sweat:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Can cancel if you want or just come for dinner.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I want to see you before you go!!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Me too. :red-heart:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Don’t mistake me suggesting cancelling for not wanting to see you. I really do. Just wanted to give you the option if your not feeling up for it as I know it’s a hard week and your sick plus a late night last night.\\
Don’t want you feel pressured by me.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It is a hard week. I was thinking to maybe just pop by for some food and a cuddle for an hour or so? I'm happy to do a takeout if you don't want to cook?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That all works for me. I’ll cook. Got the food and it’s easier. Save a takeaway for another day.\\
You still aiming for 6:30? I can try and have dinner ready.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I'll aim for that but will have to let you know exactly after I get home, if that's okay?\\
Sorry you're going to have such a rubbish company tonight :grinning-face-with-sweat:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah that’s all good. Why is it going to be rubbish. Your just sick and tired :yawning-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You watch. We will both be completely fine next week. Then it’s my turn to be sick \/ recovering.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just to warn. I am not dressed in my best due to packing etc. :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Does that mean I can come in my cosies?\\
Just got home, M40 was bad\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Turn up how ever you like :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You'll regret saying that. Honestly look like hell warmed over at this point. Wednesdays are not my days :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well hopefully not too more Wednesdays left on the grand scheme of things.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00005385-GIF-2024-01-10-18-00-21.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: If you don't mind my snotty face I'll have a real one please\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh and just to add to the wonderfulness of this week... Guess what :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m not good at guessing\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I came on :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That won’t help with you feeling better\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Definitely not\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And wasn't supposed to happen either\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: But in terms of us “doing stuff” I wasn’t expecting anything today.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Really?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Stress trigger or did you miss some pills?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: DRUGS\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Stress trigger and I think I must have missed a couple of days when I was refilling my old lady pill box\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well at least it won’t be happening over your birthday\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Woo hoo (fingers crossed)\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Silver lining and all.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How do you do those comments on paired?? I don't know how to reply to them or see them outside of the notification\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Switch to the discussion tab within the question.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Shall I aim for food to be ready for 7?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes please :pleading-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Must be an iPhone thing\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Can sort later.\\
You means must be an android thing :grinning-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm so sorry, I won't make it for 6.30. just out of shower. Put clothes on, feed the cat and will be on my way\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm glad we've managed it even with my snotty face\\
I will miss you, you know\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Me too. You were much less snooty than advertised.\\
I already miss your face.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: What name will you use on the soft cat job?\\
Ed can put a word in with the recruiter\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Full name. Lucia Endrodyova\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: He isn’t sure what he can do as it isn’t within his department but it can’t hurt to get a recommendation from someone that already works there.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh definitely. I really appreciate you reaching out to him\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Right, should really go to bed.\\
Hope the rest of the packing goes well.\\Sleep well, night night xx\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You’re not in bed already?\\
Get in.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night. x.\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've slept some.\\
I really enjoyed our time yesterday. It's so nice just to chill and talk with you.\\Yes please! Hurry up and land :winking-face:\\Everything packed and ready to go?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Let's do it another time. You will be shattered - we can have a quiet one for my bday :smiling-face: x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well, bags are packed. I don’t think I’ve forgotten anything. Will no doubt remember when I’m on the plane but it’s not like I can’t buy anything I’m missing.\\
You’ll be asleep (or you should be) by the time I land and find internet access but I’ll message you before I get on the plane.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok, we can work out what we are doing over the next week.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope you have all your thermals, hats and gloves.\\
I'm teaching the whole morning but do pop me a text x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think I’ve got enough that’s and gloves. Will soon find out :grinning-face:.\\
Urgh, enjoy.\\I really enjoy just talking to you as well. I really noticed yesterday how you start to relax around me. Either that or you were so tired you were right on the edge of falling asleep\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Don’t forget to go through and apply for that softCat role.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I do relax around you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
I told you you calm my nervous system\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well I’m pleased I can help you feel better in some way.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You do!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: 3 hour delay :man-facepalming: new take off time 15:15.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh nooo. Why?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have no idea. They just said “operational constraints” which seems to mean nothing. They are going to be careful to keep it under 3 hours though. Or some sort of compensation is given.\\
I do have my £8 food voucher to spend. Might get a cup of water :face-with-tears-of-joy:.\\Does mean I’m reading my uni book.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Probably missing a pilot or some crew.\\
Ooooh £8, don't go all overboard with that, make sure to save some :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Given that my 2 coffee’s, sausage egg muffin and a pan au chocolate was £30 for breakfast you can only imagine the small sandwich you can get for £8.\\
Well, sandwich, drink and nuts was £10\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Do you get a bit of a better afternoon? As in less teaching.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What are your crazy plans for after school?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh god I forget you need a mortgage for the airport :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I had a mentor meeting with my ect and now it's lunch soon and then form and y8 :face-with-rolling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I have a session with Steph at 5.30 and then hopefully will get to the softcat application :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just leave the house keys with security and then just take what you want from the shelves :grinning-face:\\
A good meeting?\\Oh nice. So you’ll be completely broken later then :face-with-tears-of-joy: could help with sleeping\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah it wasn't bad. I'm the mentor so she was a bit up in the air while I wasn't here.\\
Oh I'm really hoping that will be the case, I'm absolutely shattered\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: In theory it should help. Might need to try and change something with your sleep on the theory nothing changes if nothing changes.\\
Need to find a way for a sleep over at mine. Even if you take the spare bed I think you’d sleep quite well (after the first night) as it’s so much quieter.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But what about Spud???? :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But yes, we can try a sleepover at yours after you're back\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Spud is a problem to solve but solvable. As he is left ok during the day my assumption is it would be the same overnight. As long as he has had food.\\
At least you wouldn’t have 2 of us waking you up.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: He will be lonely though :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: he’ll be asleep as your snoring won’t wake him up.\\
I’m assuming he doesn’t break plant pits during the day when you at work and only does it for attention when you’re at home? <This message was edited>\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Boarding now.\\
Chat tomorrow. Have a good evening.\\Night. x. :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hace a safe flight.\\
Text me when you get a chance so I know you've arrived safe please X X X\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Still on plane waiting for it to be loaded :man-facepalming:. Will txt when I can after I land. Have a good session\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh hope it doesn't take too long.\\
She's had to reschedule :upside-down-face:\\Have a good flight X X X x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Doh, you going anyway or resting? Probably a good thing being ill. You can go 100\% on it when it happens.\\
I’d probably vote rest or a very light session.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You didn’t answer this?\\
Im having random thoughts while flying.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to rest and then go straight from work tomorrow\\
\section*{Friday $12\textsuperscript{th}$}
\textbf{Paul Busby}: At passport control. The whole day is taking forever. Will send other updates later. Hope you’re fast asleep. x.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sort of settled in Giles house. Just about to have a shower to wash the plane off and then get some sleep.\\
You might even be awake by the time I finish in the shower.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning\/evening XX\\
Glad you arrived safe. How was the flight?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah sorry, must have missed it. Yes, the road is slowly getting shorter :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The flight itself was fine. Had a row completely to myself. Which was great. The entertainment system was the best I’d seen. Food was as expected.\\
Main issue was by the time we actually took off I was already done. We were on the plane for 40minutes before we took off. Plus the 3 hour delay. Then we had to wait 20 minutes at the other end. Airport here was pretty quick.\\Just end up with the headache and stomachaches from the plane.\\Will see how much sleep I get know given that if I was at home I’ve basically powered through. I did get a few hours of broken sleep on the plane.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00005477-GIF-2024-01-12-05-48-02.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's been a big ol' day for you!\\
Into the bed you go and hopefully you'll get some good sleep.\\Is it super cold?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hope so. Not super cold. No wind and it’s very dry. Meant to be -15 but didn’t feel like it.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I love that type of cold :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m off to sleep. Will msg when I wake up and get moving. Hope you have a good day at school\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m sure it will be colder when I actually get in it and im not knackered\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night, sleep well and talk later xx\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Morning \/ afternoon. x.\\
Hope your day has gone well.\\I’m just starting to get up and see what happening today.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: <attached: 00005485-GIF-2024-01-12-16-11-45.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How did you sleep? Feeling alright?\\
I made a quick exit and just parked up at home.\\Have you found out what the plan is for today?x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Slept pretty well all the way to 6am. Feels like I’ve been awake for ages though.\\
Just got a headache which is expected.\\Working out the plan. Going out somewhere for food.\\I’ve got some cleaning to do (don’t laugh too hard) as there is construction dust everywhere. Should get some work done. Giles is “working” today.\\Main project might be to put a TV on the wall.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s crap on the softCat app. Has to be another internal promotion one to get that response so fast.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully the headache goes quickly.\\
Cleaning eh? :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\Can't wait to hear about all your adventures :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah it sucks\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You’d have been real good at that job as well.\\
It did say who the hiring person was or maybe you could respond direct to the email and reach out (:face-vomiting: I don’t like the term) to see what other roles they may have that suit your skill set.\\It’s just a lot of dust and I can almost taste it. Just don’t need it all over my stuff :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\You hitting the gym  now?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know, it would have been perfect.\\
Oh I've never done that - not sure what I would say.\\Ah yeah, I'd be doing the same.\\Errrm. Probably not. I'm still really poorly with this godforsaken lurgy and in a world of pain from everything else :disappointed-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just a little intro and say what sort of Job you’re looking for. Doesn’t have to be long. You never know, could turn into something. Plus it shows a level of keenness.\\
Good to rest. Sorry you still have the plague. Trying to workout with it is counterproductive I think as you just feel bad.\\DRUGS!\\You park running?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki, I'll have a think.\\
I'm just so exhausted again plus the lurgy. I am running on -100 spoons since Wednesday.\\I don't think I'll PR tomorrow, I just need some sleep. But if I'm up I might change my mind.\\Have you made a plan? What's the time there anyway? :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Nothing to lose by sending the email. It’s already a No. it can’t be more No. really doesn’t have to be fancy.\\
Best to recharge your spoons.\\Just  about to start dusting and go from there.\\I am -7 from you.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I also realised yesterday that I had tickets to Russell Howard tonight that I bought about 6 months ago :face-with-tears-of-joy: so taking Michelle\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: So 10am?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Why are you making me think? :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I thought about that when I saw Laura FB post.\\
That should be good but won’t help with spoons.\\You need a proper weekend of being a hermit.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s what I do :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just emailed you what I sent the PhD supervisors as an intro. As a base for emailing softCat and other companies. Really doesn’t need to be complicated. Attach a copy of your CV as well.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Something to do tomorrow when you might have found a few more spoons\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I do but it doesn't look like it's going to be this weekend. I've overcommitted myself once again :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone::woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What else have you planed?\\
Rule \#1\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Catching up with Laura for a coffee and then Patri for dinner\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh that’s not too bad.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hermit the rest of the time\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And Sunday will have to be working day\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hopefully not too much?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes too much :loudly-crying-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Stupid questions. Does it all need to be done and what bad things happen if some of it isn’t done?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It does because otherwise I will have nothing to teach :confused-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Feels like that would make teaching much easier if it’s nothing :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Enjoy the comedy. Gutted I cannot see it. He is very funny.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m a problem solver :grinning-face:\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Stupid friends that live far away\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: This is all your fault somehow anyway. If we’d have been dating sooner I’d have arranged things so we could have gone together :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Although we need to add comedy gig to the list.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's not me who was a creeper (as you referred to yourself) and didn't ask me out sooner :woman-shrugging-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You could have asked me!! I could have only gained us a month, maybe.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I didn't know!!!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You didn’t know that you liked me until I asked you out?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Making you think again\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Kinda I guess. I wasn't really looking if that makes sense. And you weren't sending some massive signals out my way either :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sort of makes sense. I could have been sending signals. I’ve no idea how or even if I was. But I could have been :grinning-face:\\
The internet does say to stop looking and you’ll find.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You weren't :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Apparently so! Quite a good find tbh :winking-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, I don’t think you’ve chosen too badly at all. :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
How exactly would one send signals? Just out of interest.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ooof, watch out for that big head :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It does have trouble fitting through doors.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not surprised :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think I got pretty lucky with my find as well.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You did! :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Now who’s head got bigger :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I always knew that. It's not news :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I mean, you get to deal with a poorly person majority of the time. I'm definitely the luckier one :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well I have that in writing now :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Get past the cold, winter and new job and see what positive effects it has on you.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And see what happens if you’d rest a bit more …\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Miracles!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00005546-GIF-2024-01-12-18-41-06.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know I know\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Full rest next weekend?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes! Just the panto on Friday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think a new job will do wonders for your brain.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think so too. I've been so absolutely exhausted already this week\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m not even sick and I’ve made myself consistently very sick with different work.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Super late night on Tuesday set the rest of the week really. So hard to recover the sleep with a 5am alarm.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah ans I really haven't been sleeping well at all this week\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Some of that is the work stress\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And I don’t think your sleeping is optimal for sucess\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Definitely\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What do you mean?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Your bedroom has a lot of noise and light. Some uncontrollable but could be a bit better plus a fur goblin that makes random noise during the night which interrupts sleep.\\
Any and all small interruptions start to stack.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: And all of that is external before your body hates you.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's not *that* bad :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s not bad but could be improved. All about the little improvements.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But it's my little lovely flat :pleading-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I wasn’t suggesting moving.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It would be something like finding a way to block more light and some sort of white noise\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just going into the swan. Will talk later xx\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have fun.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Do you want to go to a comedy night at Michelle and Adrian's community centre? Sat 3rd Feb\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sure. Should be fun.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Brill. Michelle will get us tix x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Are you not busy with other birthday related stuff\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Dinner on the 2nd\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's a birthday month :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s why I checked\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I wanna make the most of it. You know I struggle with bdays (like with any other big celebration\/fuss)\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You should make the most of it.\\
Me checking wasn’t a hint to not do it. It was just a check to see if you were actually free as you’d previously said you were busy every month in Feb.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I know you were just asking because I tend to overbook popette :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Russell Howard was *brilliant*\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh good. I’ve seen him live a couple of times and he is very funny.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've seen his works in progress before and they are always so so good\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: If guessing this is him testing out material?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup yup. For netflix special I think\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That must have been where I did my art show\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes it is!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Certainly worth a go. Not  the biggest venue\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They already got us tickets :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Nice\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you do drugs?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah. That question is going to get me in trouble :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What have you been up to?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Only if the answer is no will it get you in trouble\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Done and doing some uni work and done some cleaning. Full rock and roll. Think we are venturing out later for food but no idea where and we will probably attempt to setup some of the cinema room. Waiting for a huge sofa to be delivered before we can go anywhere\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's a pretty full on day.\\
Have you been outside?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00005596-VIDEO-2024-01-12-22-25-49.mp4>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Technically yes. I stepped outside to have a look but not really been out.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It is certainly cold\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Omg that is such an American house!\\
Massive!\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep, it’s funny how similar it is to their place in Texas. Their master bedroom is bigger than your whole flat\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think the ground floor or the basement is bigger than my house\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Crazy!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The sound travels like there are no walls\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I can imagine!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Plus EVERY single device likes to make its presence known when it’s doing something\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I guess I should wish you good night?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Or are you overstimulated from going out\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm slowly getting ready for bed but not in yet\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yea :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Pottering to bed? :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Indeed. You know I love it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You certainly seem to.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Meh I could be doing worst things :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Like?\\
Set yourself up.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I mean in general. There are worst things than pottering around :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Accurate and very none specific. Clever.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :woman-shrugging-light-skin-tone::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. Pottered all the way to bed now :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok. I hope you start to feel better soon. Dragged on too long now. Try not to worry about what ever it is your worrying about for work.\\
Have fun with Laura tomorrow as I’m guessing you won’t be or shouldn’t be awake before I go to sleep.\\Night. x.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I hope I won't be awake but feel free to text if you fancy it .\\
Have a great day.x\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Miss your face x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Miss your face as well. x.\\
\section*{Saturday $13\textsuperscript{th}$}
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Morning. x. I’m off to bed now. Not the early night I expected.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning X\\
Sleep well.x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Morning \/ afternoon. x.\\
You were up early than expected. How’s the cold? Did you meet up with Laura.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Helloooo!\\
I was but then went back to sleep. Still majorly bunged up and feeling sorry for myself. Yes I did just now, and will go straight to Patri's.\\How was yesterday? What did you get up to ? Tell me everything :smiling-face: x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Is the cold getting any better? I’d have thought it should be getting better after more than a week. Doctor maybe?\\
Did you email softcat? ( he asks knowing)\\Early dinner for you then with Patri.\\Yesterday, manged some work. Guys came to install ground floor sofa.\\A new basement sofa arrived which was installed “wrong” according to Michelle (Giles wife who is in Texas) so Giles and I had to take it apart and fix the issue. It was all in sections. Just took a while.\\I tried to do some dusting of the floors but needs and actual mop and bucket not the swiffer thing they have. So that might be a today job. Hovered as well.  Just trying to get rid of the dust.\\Went out to dinner at a local burger place which was really good. It is now fucking cold outside -15.\\Started watching a movie. Giles had set up some fancy backlight thing that he was desperate to test out.\\Thing that’s it.\\Today is going to be mounting the tv on the room in the cinema room, blind in my room and an attempt to build and interior wall out of these strange big LEGO blocks.\\Personally I think they should have just paid a man to but up an actually wall but they make some odd choice with what they will and won’t spend money on.\\Oh and we booked to see a basketball game tomorrow night.\\Btw- I miss your face. x.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's just the congestion to be honest. My head is just full of it.\\
I have been out since the morning so no I haven't had a chance.\\Will just do a walk and a coffee. I'm knackered to be honest and just want to be home.\\Oh wow, you've done so much already!\\I didn't realise Michelle wasn't there. Is she staying in Texas long?\\Are you having a good time?\\I miss you!x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s weird your knackered after being ill all week with bad sleep and then spending all of Saturday so far outside :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Bath later.\\Are you steaming? Plus more drugs.\\One of the reasons I have come for so long is that it’s just me and Giles. The last couple of times it’s been a real pain when his kids are there.\\So Michelle and kids are at home in Texas and the reason Giles is here is so that house stuff can get done. They have been dealing out who is here and who stays home. There is a third person as well which I think I mentioned.\\It does mean I hear the 3 times a day calls from Michele where she guilts Giles about how awful the children are behaving. Today will be bad because the kids list game console access yesterday.\\They have  very codependent relationship.\\Good so far. Tired but good.\\I miss you too.\\Really hope this cold shifts for you.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You're making fun of me :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Yes, definitely a bath tonight.\\Oh I can definitely imagine it being much more chilled without the kids etc.\\Promise I'll never guilt you about kids being bad :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\Just got to Patri's\\Xx\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I would never make fun of you :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Glad you’re starting to work me out.\\Just the bad pets then for the guilt trips :grinning-face:\\Enjoy. x.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Starting to?\\
No bad pets here. Me and Spuddles have a good routine going :smiling-face:\\Just parked up at home. It's so cold here too. Honestly can't wait for bath.\\What are you getting up to?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: \url{https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGe6F9Bv2/}\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well we are still learning about each other. Lots left to learn but at least you get I’m trying to be funny and I’m not defaulting to mean or rude.\\
Just got back from brunch and picking up 2 tv’s from FB marketplace.\\Just sitting for a moment and then will try mounting the TV on the wall.\\Enjoy the bath. If you felt better and I was in a position to take advantage I might be asking for things.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You'd better not be defaulting to mean or rude :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Ooh what did you have for brunch?\\I'm only just about to start drawing the bath ... Pottered around :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Brunch was a pork hash. Which ended up being potatoes bacons and scrambled egg. Good though.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that sounds nice!\\
I am jealous of the foods you'll be eating :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00005639-GIF-2024-01-13-19-51-42.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeeeea\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Actual video of me\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It will all start to disagree with me soon. Always too rich.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That I would like to see :winking-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Of course you would :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That is very true. Are the portions ridiculous?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Pretty big. I think brunch would be 2 meals for you.\\
You really don’t need starters or anything.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Drugs.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Took them ages ago :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: TV done?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Nope, we are starting with a blind\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah alright!\\
I hope you're getting some chill out time in there too. Otherwise you'll be coming back knackered\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: There will be. Giles is a big guy. Much bigger than I ever was. So rest is happening.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Btw, I was asked a question today which I didn't know how to answer as we haven't talked about it explicitly\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Go on?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Patri asked if we were official :eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :eyes::eyes:\\
Well we did disable our dating profiles so I think the inference was there and I think you hinted at it the other day.\\I’ve been calling you my girlfriend to other people and haven’t been dating anyone else or had any interest in dating anyone else since our first date.\\So I’d like to think the short answer is yes.\\What did you tell her?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well, I deleted my apps already :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Oh how did I hint at it?\\Awwww, have you?\\Just so it's out there I have not been dating anyone else since our first date either.\\Oh I said yes :face-with-tears-of-joy: but did say we didn't explicitly stated it to each other\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: There was some hint about me taking the masculine role on something. I completely missed it at the time and then assumed it was the girlfriend boyfriend chat otherwise I have no clue.\\
And yes on the calling you my girlfriend. Much better than trying to explain “a women from my running club I’ve been dating for a few weeks etc”\\:smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I can't remember that :face-with-tears-of-joy: (what a surprise)\\
I mean glad you have a rational supporting statement there :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\Everyone around me knows we're together\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well I do like logic and it just seems better to say you’re my girlfriend.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It does sound good :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Right. I'm in bed and going to read a bit.\\
Hope you have a brilliant rest of the day xx\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Enjoy. I’ll wish you good night then. Night. x.\\
One blind down :grinning-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well done!\\
\section*{Sunday $14\textsuperscript{th}$}
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00005667-GIF-2024-01-14-05-41-41.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope you sleep well xx\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well I’m awake. So that’s not good. Think the heating woke me. Will try and get back to sleep in a bit.\\
You were up early again?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It is waaaay too early for you! Go back to bed :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I went to the gym finally :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Still in it.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You know what I mean :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh well done. How was it? You broken squared now?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I leg pressed 153kg!!!!! On two full sets!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And pr'd on squats again\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Flipping heck. Well done. How did you do such an odd number?\\
What’s the squat?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well the machine is 53kg on its own\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 75kg again two full sets\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What an odd weight for the machine and lighter than I will guess. The gym fit one was 75kg on its own.\\
When you say full sets how many is that?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 10!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh fuck that. Well done. Thats insane\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :beaming-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: 10 would be bad enough but why would you do 3628800\\
Little math joke for you.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I got it!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Right, don't wake yourself up too much\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You surprise me again. Not sure I know anyone who would have got that joke.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm full of surprises :relieved-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: But seriously. 10 reps at max weight is incredible. I don’t like doing 10 reps for squats at any weight. 6 max is much better.\\
Make sure to do all the boring yoga stretches etc\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You know I always do them at the gym :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And another bath later\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nah I had one yesterday. Don't like taking baths every day\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How’s the work going? Do you have an indoor day today?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: An indoor day yes! Haven't started work, will have a little lie down first :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How’s the cold?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, your back in bed then\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Still congested but at least the eye is not leaking anymore\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is some good side eye\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Of course\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Go sleep some more. We'll chat later x\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Miss your face big time\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok, you to.\\
Miss your face x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I slept a bit more. How was the nap?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I'm glad you managed a little more. It's still early though!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nap was meh\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah it still early.\\
Why a bad nap. Get back in there and try harder.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah. Just in and out, not very restful. No more naps now otherwise tomorrow will be horrendous\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just made lunch and then work\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You didn’t touch yourself first then before napping? It would help\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-rolling-eyes::face-with-rolling-eyes::face-with-rolling-eyes::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What's the plan for today?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not 100\% sure. Think a couple more blinds needs to go up. We have a basketball game this evening which should be fun.\\
Try out these big Lego bricks to build a wall. I’ll send a pic later and I should do a bit of work.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What town are you actually in?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yeah those Lego bricks sound interesting!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: City of Denver but where actually I have no idea\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh who are you seeing then?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Denver vs someone\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh is it? :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Eh, you mean the  basketball game or have a missed something\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes yes the basketball. I just assumed it was Denver Vs someone\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Fair but I have no idea. Giles booked it. It so we can see “a basketball game” we really don’t have much interest in the teams.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah okay\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's going to be fun I'm sure!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They get very excited about sport the americans\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Should be, we did an ice hockey game in DC and that was fun.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: They get mental and we say baseball last summer\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It is all so over the top\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Everything there is\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Very true\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I mean, just that house :face-screaming-in-fear: imagine the heating bill\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I am trying not to :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have you been sleeping well?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Nope\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: New house, it makes tons of noise, time difference\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I should be ok probably by Wednesday. Just in time for full pain when I get back\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hannah will destroy you on Monday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Nothing new\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We'll be having a nap for my bday :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Possibly but “nap” would be good as well. I did just have a sex dream about you.\\
So something is different with my sleep as I don’t normally dream\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oooooh :eyes::eyes::eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What was it about??\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You. Obviously.\\
I’d tied you to a bed, went down on you multiple times to see how many time you would cum before you begged me to stop.\\I woke up before I could find out.\\Woke up super hard and rolled over to find you not here :crying-face:\\That’s why I’d hoped that maybe you taken advantage of yourself at nap time.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Even your dreams about me are as mysterious as me :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That dream is so easily replicated\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s good news then. We either need to fit your head board or try it at my house\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well you said you had the prerequisite tools so probably at yours\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s what I was thinking. Plus people can’t hear us\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That too\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hopefully that means you more relaxed\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully I won't have the lurgy anymore or put my hip out :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That too\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Difficult to move much if your tied down\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahahah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also, loved that insta post you sent :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good, I liked it. It nice to find stuff that is exactly right\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: My algorithm is now gym and lovey quotes :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It certainly a lot of mine plus some making stuff\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I like you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Phew, that’s lucky. Would be really awkward otherwise given the sex dream I just described.\\
I like you.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Knew you were going to make a joke :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well yeah.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Making you uncomfortable?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: “Hi I’m Chandler. I make jokes when I’m uncomfortable”\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: A little bit in a good way\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I want to be telling you things. And I want you to know they are true\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know and I do really like it.\\
The problem is that part of my silly brain just doesn’t think I deserve it.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You deserve it!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: But I am very comfortable with you. I wouldn’t have sent anyone else a version of that sex dream txt through fear of a negative reaction.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm glad you are.\\
And you know I'm very comfortable with you :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I really like that as well and I’m trying to get more comfortable (if that makes sense)\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And I don't know whether it's because you're far away or what but I do mean when I say I miss you. I'm finding it a bit bizarre because it has only been 2 months but I'm feeling things. Freaks me out, but at the same time I know I can tell you this because you're not going to freak out (fingers crossed)\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That doesn’t freak me out\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I agree it is a little strange as it’s only 2 months and I think you’re more avoidant than anxious which probably freaks you out more.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Strange in a bad way?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Right. I’d like to create rule \#2\\
Assume positive intent.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes::smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I didn’t assume your “freaks me out” was bad.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: As an example for rule 2\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think it's because I haven't felt things like this for a good while and it's easy with you. I'm so much more relaxed\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Aww\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well, I am easy.\\
Another joke and I’ve held back.\\I do think the same. Very easy and comfortable with you.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hurry up and come back so I can cuddle you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll work on speeding up time.\\
You hurry up and clear the cold so we can cuddle properly\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm tryyyyyyying :loudly-crying-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: We’ll get well faster :face-with-tears-of-joy:. Hopefully will go this week. Assuming you don’t have some crazy evening scheduled\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Errrmmmm.... Bookclub tomorrow and parents evening on Tuesday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And then?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Twilight on Wednesday, Steph session on Thursday, panto on Friday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Parents evening is just garbage\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes it is\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So a really chill and relaxing week then :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh very\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: On the plus side (sort of) doesn’t seem like you would have been able to see me anyway. So maybe it’s better I’m 8000miles away\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll be full of energy when you get back :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well that I haven’t seen.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I would have made time\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I won’t :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Trying to find a silver lining\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: We would have found some time\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: This was in reference to your energy msg.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We can be knackered together\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You’ve said you’ll have all the energy! So that I can lie there and take it :winking-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh you're misunderstanding me :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll have all the energy \/s\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh good. Got it in writing twice :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s -23 outside :cold-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sarcasm!!!!!!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: God that sounds glorious\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Didn’t read like sarcasm when you wrote it.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's why I included the *\/s*\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Reddit style\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No sarcasm on this one :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-rolling-eyes::face-with-rolling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You know me better than to assume that I'll have any energy\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well yes. Your energy is a lot different.\\
Still enough power in the battery for squats\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just a short battery life.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Very few spoons\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Why we need to plan more of our stuff to be in the morning\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Especially the tied down stuff\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Or around naps\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And the getting new job.\\
After naps I assume\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes definitely a new job\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Naps do a partial recharge of one or two spoons I assume\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: But the nap takes a spoon\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know I'm not going to be magically better straight away but it should improve things for me\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Logically it has to. Like the insta reel I sent. You’d only have to do work at work and be in a job where deadlines can actually move. No one does if it doesn’t get done. Academia just doesn’t accept that something won’t get done when it should. <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Wait\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I edited it to make sense\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And I won't have to make 1500+ decisions every day\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That as well. That’s a big one.\\
Growing up we all liked the idea of choosing things. No thank you.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've got a major decision fatigue as you know\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not unusual and I can help with that.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You do\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Even though I get overwhelmed\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: With the decisions or me helping\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The decisions\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And then the options\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But that's a me thing\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: We just go through them I’ll help. Done. Easy.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Analysis paralysis. Very common.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Something in the brain doesn’t want to make the wrong one and more option don’t help.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's the actions post decision I also struggle with :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh, the implication of the plan. That’s the worst. After choosing.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: New job. Did you apply to Pearson and email softCat?\\
We will sort the flat. Might have to make some uncomfortable choices to “get it done”. Progress is better than perfection.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No and no... Yet\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Do that first…\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Work first\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But it's on the list\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You’ll be tried after work.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm half way through\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh well done.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ve not ruined work then\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Other hard choices for you. Should I see Paul. Yes. Should I have sex with Paul. Yes.\\
See all easy stuff to decide.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll do the :face-with-rolling-eyes: for you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Those are not decisions I have to make\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I can’t make them\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: As in that's a given :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't have to think about it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh right.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll let you get on with work *and then* job stuff.\\
I’m going to hunt for breakfast. Spoiler, it will be a protein shake.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha. Well you go enjoy that\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sending the biggest cuddle\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And a non-germy kiss\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I really like you.\\
You’re smart and beautiful.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I really like you too :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The Pearson job disappeared. Why the fuck do they bother with submission deadlines if they're going to just pull it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s frustrating. Again, that probably means it went internally\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Booo <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s why the email might get something. Maybe not but still worth a try. Just gotta keep going. It’s a numbers game unless you have an in somewhere.\\
How many ibuprofen do you want? Just about to order 1000\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: that will be plenty. Thank you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ve found 30mg melatonin\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Is it expensive?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That wasn’t the question. Are they stronger than you can get at home\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh let me have a look\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You can only get ones that promote melatonin creation so no actual melatonin in them\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok, 30mg seems the strongest so I’ll get those\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you, you absolute star\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And please let me know how much these are\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've emailed softcat\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00005888-GIF-2024-01-14-16-03-22.mp4>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I can get naproxen as well if you like?\\
I’ll work out price. I wasn’t worried about it.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No no, no naproxen . I have a prescription but I can't take it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: 500 ibuprofen is about \$12\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok, I’m getting some for myself because it’s a real pain to get from the doctor if I get gout\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You do need to ask for the tummy protection meds from your GP though!!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, that’s on the list. I only ever end up taking 5 or 6 max to get through the worse of the pain.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But you said it still buggers up your stomach\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It does. Just shifts the pain around :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've applied to 2 more jobs\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done. Government or mega corp?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: One mega one not so mega\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: British airways and something called Funding Circle\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Basketball is an afternoon game. So we are just heading out. Might miss you (already do) before you go to bed.\\
Enjoy the rest of your evening and I’ll wish you good night just in case. Night. x.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have the best time. Can't wait to hear about it tomorrow\\
Miss you too xx\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: \url{https://pixietigerart.squarespace.com/shop/p/u3qqay2pu14oahvyxr67pazbeqfd18?fbclid=IwAR3Ewv1LYuE6r964ychS7qhmuoroR5NLUKe0BahpqLtqNCL0J-56-N6jzMw}\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That looks more like hand stuff vs making with a wheel.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah it is I think. Were you thinking about recreating the scene from Ghost?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That could be awkward in a room full of people. :grinning-face:\\
I was more thinking about a wheel.\\Power tools etc.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: \url{https://www.walledgardenpottery.com/booking-calendar/clay-taster?referral=service-list-widget}\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't think there are any beginner classes with wheels\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok, I need to check with my artist friend as I think she does starter wheel classes\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Few of the girls have done the walled garden and apparently it's really good\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oooooh yes please\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: We can certainly give it a go.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'd love to\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Isn’t it the same day as the comedy?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The first one.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: We are off now. Chat later\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yay! Enjoy :smiling-face-with-heart-eyes:\\
\section*{Monday $15\textsuperscript{th}$}
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00005921-GIF-2024-01-15-04-54-09.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm glad you enjoyed yourself :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:.\\
Night night, sleep well xx\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m up. Slept much better. Either I’ve transitioned to the time or the room was a more stable temperature.\\
Not yet sure what we are doing but I certainly need to do some work. Might risk it all and submit my PhD application :grimacing-face:\\Hope your days been ok.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning!\\
Glad you slept well. How was yesterday? Tell me everything :smiling-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oooh! Do you have everything ready? If so, just send it through :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That looks weirdly interesting\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I thought I did in my message.\\
We did help some tourists on the way to the stadium. Which is funny given that we had no idea where we were going either.\\Basket ball does 12 minute quarters but I forget about all the stopping. So it started at 1:30 and finished near 4.\\Nice walk to and from the car park. The city seems quite nice and everything looks good with snow.\\I may have fallen asleep on the sofa a bit while we watched a film on Giles new fancy 65” 4k tv but then we built the wall.\\On the basketball teams it seemed funny that the only white players seemed to all be foreign. Which I find funny.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I will do. Certainly for the first one. I might send you some stuff.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Omg, sorry you did! I read it way too early :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Of course! Do. When is the deadline\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have you been getting out for some walks??\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I thought so. Does that mean my insta’s didn’t get full appreciation\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They diiiid!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And I like those feelings\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Also your mountain of drugs should be here tomorrow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh my :smiling-face-with-hearts: you know a way to my heart :red-heart:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Bugger, I was aiming for lower down :face-with-tears-of-joy::red-heart:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha. With drugs?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well that took a turn in the wrong direction\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahahah\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just about to eat but to be clear. I’m not trying to do anything to you while your asleep or unconscious\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah. I know!!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What are you eating?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Cheese egg meat barito\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Doesn't sound too bad\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Twas very good.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nice!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Can you please make me that spam rice thing again when you're back?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yes we can have that again.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Glad you liked it as it’s super easy to make\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly I've been wanting to eat it again ever since :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, well I’ve ordered a big can of spam for next time.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You make me happy\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i still dont like that word but pretty sure you make me happy as well\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: real quick are we free on feb 2nd and or feb 10th\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: 2nd is a friday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i think you are busy\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm not free on the 2nd or the  10th..  two separate girl bday things\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Why?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: friends birthday\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You'll have to explain this to me a little more some time\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I'm sorry :pensive-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: not your fault. Less pressure for you as you cannot meet them if your busy\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i'll just have to talk about you instead\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Only good things\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: obviously\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: you off to bookclub soon? hows the cold\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: sickness not weather\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just finished therapy session\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Will head out in about half hur\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Still bit congested but much better compared to last week\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your day going?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: good?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i just did it :grimacing-face:\\
Hit send on the email for the first PhD application\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes. Though keep making her laugh with my gallows humour\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ooooooooooooooooooh\\
:crossed-fingers::crossed-fingers::crossed-fingers::crossed-fingers::crossed-fingers::crossed-fingers::crossed-fingers::crossed-fingers::crossed-fingers::crossed-fingers::crossed-fingers::crossed-fingers::crossed-fingers::crossed-fingers::crossed-fingers::crossed-fingers::crossed-fingers::crossed-fingers::crossed-fingers::crossed-fingers::crossed-fingers::crossed-fingers::crossed-fingers::crossed-fingers::crossed-fingers::crossed-fingers::crossed-fingers:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: its either laugh or cry and laughing is just more fun\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I said exactly that\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i'm glad its helping\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: She's asked today how you are with my nonsense\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: oh\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: which nonsense specifically\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Anxiety\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Etc\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: as i am not aware of any nonsense\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: nonsense your word or hers\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Obviously she didn't say nonsense :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: what did you tell her\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: about my response\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That you are a very grounding presence\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: aww, was that a good thing to her?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes!!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Of course\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: im not sure its "Oh course" i could see someone saying it could be unhealthy to require and external person. I am very pleased that I help calm you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: and = an\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't "require" you. You're just calm and that helps :relieved-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: thats good then\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And you validate my feelings which is the important bit\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i'm guessing they used to be dismissed then\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Exactly\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I might send you some updated statements soon. Updated in a way specific to the other PhD's so shouldnt be huge changes\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. Won't have a chance to look at them today probably though. Is that okay?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thats ok, I can send them tomorrow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You can absolutely send them now. Will just have a look tomorrow\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I meant i'd send the application in tomorrow. Will email them to you once ready\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: its probably best i spread out the applications a little so that the person on the other end doesn't mess it up\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: \url{https://www.reddit.com/r/Fibromyalgia/s/FLskIwRvWN}\\
Giles wife uses the gummies for her fibro.\\Not sure what access we have in the uk and you may have seen this anyway.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I do have CBD gummies, I think I might have mentioned.\\
Just leaving Marlow. It's so bloody cold\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You’ve mentioned them before just not sure how strong they are.\\
How was book club?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They are quite good tbh. I couldn't smoke weed though - too many unpredictables.\\
Book club was good. Now two new books for next month.\\How's your day been?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Tucked in bed now.\\
Will say goodnight. Enjoy your day xx\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Michelle doesn’t smoke just uses gummies. That was my thought. Not the smoking. Just don’t know what the law is in the uk regarding them as that Reddit post seemed quite consistent that they help everyone. A lot of the other posts about drugs have various results for people.\\
\section*{Tuesday $16\textsuperscript{th}$}
Days been ok. Got a fair amount of work done which is good and it’s good \/ scary to send off one application. I will now worry about it.\\Been trying to put blinds up but had a drill failure. Then just unloaded a full pallet loads of those wall Lego blocks. At least it was a fair amount of steps.\\I’m pretty annoyed \/ worried about how much weight I’ll be putting on this week. I’ll do better in February.\\2 books! Can you get them on audiobook and listen on the car to work?\\Hope you sleep well.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00006017-GIF-2024-01-16-05-41-03.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x\\
I didn't think you'd be still up :relieved-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s only 22:40. Heading to bed in a bit\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You've done quite a lot of bits and bobs!\\
Could you do some home workouts from YouTube or something while you're there? Just to help the head?\\Yup! I'm listening to one and will read the other\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yes, my math doesn't math this early in the morning :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
How was your evening?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m sure I could find something. We did end up moving a whole pallet of those Lego block things into the house. Shame I didn’t have my phone as I think I’ve done my steps for the day and then up and down a flight of stairs at least 50 times.\\
Meant to be warmer from tomorrow so might make it out for at least a walk maybe a run at some point.\\Evenings been good. Watched a couple of movies. Wrath of man and John wick. Then build the wall with Lego bricks. I’ll send a pic in the morning when the light is better.\\I emailed you those updated statements if you get a chance to have a read while I’m asleep.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It might help not feeling like you're going back in yourself.\\
It's always hard when you're on holiday and there's food and other things to do\\Sounds like a lovely time :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\I just need it to be 6.30 so I can come back home :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\I've seen the email pop up, I'll have a look during my free period today\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sending a massive kiss and a hug\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s the break in the routine plus my irrational fear that a week of will ruin nearly 4 years of progress. Not helped by multiple routine breaks all stacking. Center parcs, US, vasectomy and then Hannah taking time off. It will be fine, I just don’t like it.\\
It’s not quite the day for me yet but happy second month anniversary.\\Chat to you later.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm here to help in whatever way works for you.\\
Happy 2 months :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: (where are my hugs and kisses ? :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:)\\Hope you sleep well x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00006027-GIF-2024-01-16-06-17-20.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::purple-heart:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You’ll have to wait till Monday for the real thing\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm okay with that :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: just missed the 'xx' s\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ops\\
x x x\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night! X\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How’s the day going so far?\\
All set to tell parents how their kids need to listen more and stop goofing around in class.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning! How did you sleep?\\
Day's been okay. Started the parents evening about an our ago. Already had a complicated conversation :confused-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I was unconscious for a period of time :grinning-face: bit broken but ok.\\
Oh that started earlier than I thought. Doesn’t sound fun. How \/ why was it complicated?\\Is there child selling blowjobs for packets of crisps? True story I got once.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah we start at 2.\\
Jeezus Christ, that is not something that's happening here.\\No parent wants to hear that their kid is not doing as well as they think. And obvs it's my fault. And this one always comes into every conversation very guns blazing\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I had a look at the personal statements - you changed so little that I don't really have comments.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Obviously it’s your fault. She is just the parent. No doubt far too busy and exhausted to actually apply discipline or rules to the child. That’s what teachers are meant to do. \/s\\
Clearly going in all fun blazing she know it’s her fault and wants all around to think it’s you.\\No doubt all very draining for you.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thank you. Your amazing. x x x\\
Will update.\\Didn’t need to change much. Just remove the chemistry bit and then AI wasn’t needed in one and had to change JWST for the other. Will send them in a bit :grimacing-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Super very draining.\\
Might treat my self to dinner on the way back\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good plan. Treat yourself. Hello Boss is back up or sushi?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't know what I fancy\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Uh oh, danger :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Or noddle nation for a stir fry?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ooooooooh\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Would have to park in town wouldn't i\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i think you could park just outside of it like all the pick up drivers do\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: rather than have to park in the swan\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have you met me? Going somewhere and not knowing parking situation :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I'll see what I feel like when I leave here. Might be too knackered for more than cereal\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What's the plan for today?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: boo, which company was that for?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Remember Rule \#1 and DRUGS\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Funding Circle\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Currently doing some Uni work and i think i'll be putting up some blinds later. Not sure beyond that yet. Will be going out for food (hopefully) and watching a movie. Going to be a uni and jobs day i think\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: At least it is crossed off the list. Onto the next\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Would be good to at least be getting interviews. Feels shit\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: it would but this does seem to be what finding a job is like. It all very similar to dating. Gotta just keep collecting No's until you find a yes.\\
I think ive only ever interviewed for 4 jobs in my life and 2 of them i got\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How many did you apply for?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: can't remember and in fairness probably not a huge amount. I was a little privileged though in that anything i applied had an extremely neiche skill set which I had. SharePoint and project server skills are still like hens teeth.\\
I know from other people who have used job boards its is just a pure numbers game. My friend Rich in wales spend weeks applying for stuff day after day and i think he got, maybe, 2 interviews. Then got a job via a friend :man-facepalming:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully something will come through soon\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: you will. Just keep going. x x x\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh speaking of blinds, I'll need some too :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: we can add that to the list. It is very much worth making sure they are the right size as cutting them is a massive pain. I always mess it up. Fitting them is fine.\\
For your bedroom?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: All windows really. I need to measure again - I'm always so worried I didn't measure right, that's why I haven't ordered them yet\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Happy to help with that. I have a fancy laser measure as well. Will find out how square your windows are.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oooh fancy laser measure! Woop\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 90 more minutes of this :loudly-crying-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: oh god. Pain\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly :face-with-rolling-eyes: just want to go home\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: it probably not allowed but i would have made up a sheet with each kids name and gove them scores on different things with maybe a short sentence comment. Leave that on the table and go home\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's virtual :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: WHAT!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: thats even worse\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: so your just on a teams call\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: mass email then.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We have a system. They book in, 5mins per app and it just moves through them\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: thats sounds horrid\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Exactly\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And I will probs have to call the ones that didn't turn up\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: and i assume those are the parents that really need to attend\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yuuuuup\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not even big picture but in a few months you'll have a new job and not have to speak to parents\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I do enjoy speaking to the nice ones :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i bet that is nice. Just a shame they arn't all nice\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: To be honest, it was only that one that was complicated\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Today\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: thats not a bad percentage then, really\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No it isn't\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Even though those I really need are not booking in\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: what did you choose in the end for food?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I haven't left yet :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :loudly-crying-face::loudly-crying-face::loudly-crying-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I decided I have food at home. I am a stupid sensible adult :face-with-rolling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: As long as your following rule \#1. Sensible is annoying but no doubt saves money\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Time to relax now.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know but I really fancied KFC :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just parked up\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: KFC isn’t the best for parking and pick up\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's what made the decision :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And getting it delivered is a bit sad. Always the wrong side of tepid\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah. No KFC for me\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What have you been up to?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Send off the other 2 PhD applications. Then been banging my head trying to do an assignment. Stuck on a question where I’m 90\% there but just don’t know and I’m not sure what bit I don’t know in order to try and find the answer. Will just have to throw stuff in and see what sort of marks I get.\\
Hung 2 blinds as well. Moving into the next room.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Super productive! Well done!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well, not as much as I’d like but it is progress. Thanks\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Progress is progress :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you settled for the evening now\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm pottering :face-with-rolling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh, as I expected\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00006114-GIF-2024-01-16-20-37-25.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Filling my old lady pill box\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Don’t have too much fun\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know how to live that rock'n'roll life\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well you do have to entertain yourself when I’m not there\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How is the cold today?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Better but STILL congested :sneezing-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That really is dragging on\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: More drugs :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: So muuuuuuch\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm done with it now. I'd like to be able to breathe\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Breathing is helpful. Is it getting better or just stayed the same\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Getting better but tiny little increments\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I guess I should wish you good night x x x\\
Don’t think about me so much you lose sleep :winking-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm just getting ready for bed. Too much pottering :face-with-rolling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I really must see this pottering in action\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night. Hope you have a good rest of the day x x x\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm literally just walking around very slowly doing bits and bobs :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is what I picture I’m just not sure what the bits and bobs are\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Me neither :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: In bed now, finally!\\
Night night.\\Miss your face xx\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You made it all that way :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Miss you x x x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: A thought while you are sleeping. The comedy thing we have on the 3rd. Maybe we could plan that out so that you stay over at mine :grimacing-face:. We can come up with a plan for spud and i should be back in action by then. Not that action is the whole reason for you to stay over. Just there is zero chance that my body isn't going to react to a smoking hot women laying next to me.\\
\section*{Wednesday $17\textsuperscript{th}$}
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x\\
Yes, we can definitely have a think about arranging that :smiling-face:\\Did you have a good evening?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00006140-GIF-2024-01-17-05-45-54.mp4>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Evenings been good. Managed a bit more work and then we went to see “The Bee Keeper”. Fun but we ate at the cinema, they deliver to your seat. Food was good but I did spend \$70 on a burger, nachos and 2 drinks.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh nice! I fancy seeing that (when it comes on streaming).\\
Well that are some cinema prices!:face-screaming-in-fear:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s certainly worth a watch. Quite ridiculous but fun.\\
It’s all very expensive, the more I go out the less I want to go out.\\What’s your day like today. I can’t remember what you said you had on this evening.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just work and then I'm giving myself a bday treat. Getting my brows and nails done :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Fancy, part of your birthday month.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Of course :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I only ever treat myself to stuff like nails super rarely\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well enjoy. No doubt I’ll chat to you before or after.\\
Hope school goes ok. x x x\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I hope so!\\
Night night, sleep well x x x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hello,\\
One thing I’ve never understood about US houses and they all seem the same. They have blinds that don’t really block the light. It’s good enough but in the morning it like someone just opens the curtain. There must be a huge percentage of the population with sleeping issues or poor sleep.\\Anyway. Hope your days been ok.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy: what a thought for an early morning\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Lots of thoughts this morning. These houses are so loud. You can almost hear someone blink.  Match that with the poor light blocking and I wondered if the systemic poor sleep contributes to the overweight problem. Given that tired people will eat more.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's their whole system. From houses, to portions, to lack of rest and affordable healthcare. Everything together makes for big population. I don't think I could live there\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also, what a complete jinx on today's paired :beaming-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I used to want to live in the US but not now. The appeal has all gone. I already want a dinner that doesn't have cheese or cream in it. The whole country is going backwards faster than the Uk is. They have passed a law in the US that if a child (boy) is seen wearing a dress. Then this is child neglect and the child can be taken away from the parents. Madness given that i know kids are obsessed with frozen.\\
I thought the same on the paired one. An interesting question. You do see stories of couple having arguments for stuff that happened in a dream.\\My friend Toria was fuming at her husband for a full day because she was convinced he had said something to her friends the previous night. Then after being a bitch all day she talked about it and then realized it was a dream. She even had to check with her friend that it didnt happen.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that's hilarious :face-with-tears-of-joy: but I completely get how that could happen\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What's the plan for today?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Can you come home already??\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: A classic example of not talking causing problems\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Some work, then we are trying to finish off the theatre room setup and maybe the games room as well. Got to go out to the hardware shop for some supplies and then i'm hoping we go out for dinner. I might see about a bot of a walk as well\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: HA, I mean I probably could but it would be a bit mean although it is what Giles did to me. Your busy the rest of the week anyway? You'll just have to suffer Saturday without me. I do miss you.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh walk sounds good! It will make you feel good too :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am busy but like a cuddle would be nice :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Is that all? You’ll have to use Spud as a substitute until I get back.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's all I have mental and physical strength for :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: you ok?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah, just exhausted\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :loudly-crying-face::smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Nail and stuff all done?\\
Just a reminder that I like you a lot and I’m looking forward to seeing you again next.\\Not a competition but I might be the exhausted one :man-facepalming:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just finished at the nails. Will pop to sainsbos and home.\\
I like you a lot too and I can't wait to squeeze you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Drugs\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aaaaaages ago :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oohhh. look at you. Taking care of your self and stuff.\\
Well done.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just getting ready for bed. How's your morning been?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm amazing :star-struck:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s been ok. Got some work done. Trying to get some stuff done around the house which is dragging.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You're having a very productive holiday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just had a disappointing lunch which had to be another burger :man-facepalming:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh nooo\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Why disappointing?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think have learnt a new way I should be studying.\\
Would have preferred a sandwich at home\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: All the food is borderline cold.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh tell me more?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just not an impressive sandwich\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Done a few experiments but being here I’m reading the chapter in the book and writing notes. Which is good. The missing step is that I then need to extract the images and equations into my digital notes.\\
Seems like it’s better reading and note taking with the book over reading the PDF on the computer.\\I had tried speed reading the chapter and then going on the computer but I then wouldn’t write notes. So this seems the better way. Takes longer but I think I’m understanding it more\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That is a really good way!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So what I should do is get the chapter read and notes done in the morning and then work the examples and make my computer notes on the afternoon\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Brill plan! Well done\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Shame it’s taken half the year to work out\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How was the cold today?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But you got there\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly, pretty much the same. It's just annoying\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That sucks. Keep plugging away\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am. I am\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just a slow learner as always\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Stop it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: As long as you learn, that's important\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, just one of the fundamental issues I’ve found with uni is that you don’t have time to get behind\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's a definite. You have to keep plodding on\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, keep with the flow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to turn in now\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok. Night x x x\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night. Hope the rest of your day is good\\
\section*{Thursday $18\textsuperscript{th}$}
Miss you x x x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00006204-GIF-2024-01-18-06-09-06.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning!\\
It is bizarre. We're like ships in the night.\\Hope you sleep well x x x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: But the ships are meant to bump into each other. We must be doing it wrong. :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha well we virtually bump into each other in the morning and before bed :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well this virtual bumping isn’t anywhere near as fun as the physical bumping.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah. True. But still better than nothing\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is very true. I thought we could do an actual video call. Maybe on Saturday.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yes please, that would be lovely :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Should have already done one. Maybe even when I wake up but will depend where you are. Have a good day at school or at least as good as possible\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you!\\
Sweet dreams :face-blowing-a-kiss:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hey, not sure I dreamt last night but did wake up thinking of you :winking-face:. Very frustrating I’m not in a place where I can do anything about it. Will just have to wait until I get home.\\
How was school? You all set for Steph?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I haven't left yet but getting on the road soon\\
Will text when I'm home xx\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm always on your mind :winking-face:\\
Just got home. Absolutely shattered, haven't stopped since this morning, and full day teaching. Literally will get changed and head out again :loudly-crying-face:\\How's your morning so far?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You certainly are. I'll try and not think too hard about you in your gym kit.\\
Well, ive only been awake for 90 minutes :grinning-face:. Just starting doing some work. On track to catch up which is great.\\Enjoy the session with Steph, i find they are sometimes a bit easier when your mind is broken. You dont have time to think about what your doing and just get it done.\\Then you can relax. Bath maybe.\\I would say you can relax tomorrow but no doubt your out and about?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha. You try that.\\
Oh god, I'm already fed up with the day and you're only just starting. I feel so shit after today - she's better destroy me.\\Won't have time for bath tonight. And it's panto tomorrow. And then I am not leaving the flat for the whole weekend.\\What's the plan for today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well, i can only think about it a little. Not the right place to take full advantage :winking-face:\\
Sorry your feeling so shit. I take it the cold isn't any better? Steph will ruin you or id ask for your money back. No point a session that doesn't end in ruin.\\It will be interesting to see what you think of the panto. is it the one at the swan? I'm not a fan of them.\\You mean you dont have 19 social engagements this weekend? Time to recharge a bit before the month of birthday stuff. Some hope then that i'll be the most ruined for Monday and Tuesday :grinning-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: also, your amazing x x x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: jinx again on todays paired question.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It isn't even the cold anymore, that's just annoying. I'm exhausted, haven't had one evening to myself, in pain and ran out of spoons on Tuesday. Sorry for moaning.\\
Steph did ruin me. But I did a full set of squats at 80.\\No it's the lane end players one. I've never seen a panto so going in the spirit of trying new things\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: So are you xxx\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh wow, I didn’t realise you’d run out spoons 2 days ago.\\
I wouldn’t have been sending you sexual stuff if I’d have known.\\Well done for keeping going and that amazing on squats. Another set of 10? You must be able to do 90 for at least 1 if not 3 then.\\That’s above body weight as well right?\\Drugs!\\Panto should be fun if you’ve not see one before. They are silly.\\You can recharge over the weekend. We can adapt next week if you need time to yourself.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: And that is barely moaning and I don’t mind. Just had an hour+ long rant from my friend because the level of codependency in there relationship borders on debilitating when they are apart.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah... You know I just keep pushing through. I. Need. To. Pace. Myself :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
Drugs were had.\\Planning to take it super easy over the weekend.\\I don't think I'll be finished with the hair by the time you finish gym but if I'm not I can just pop by for a quick cuddle before your tutorial.\\Can we just do some quiet food on Tuesday?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Is that Giles? Can they not be apart for long. I mean I understand that she's alone with the kids and that's horrendous and he (in her eyes) is having chill guy time\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: They cannot be apart at all and the rest is exactly right. The funny thing is that Giles normally deals with the kids in the morning and after school. So this is a bit of a wake up call for her on what he has been doing. Guess what. Kids are hard.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Rule \#1 or it will all backfire and you'll get more ill.\\
Well done on the drugs. Really odd question that just needs a yes or no. If i said "Good girl" is that something you would like?\\Well remembered because I forgot about the tutorial. I'll might skip it as it is on a chapter i wont read until later in the week so i can just watch the recording and i fully expect my brain to be mush at that point.\\Tuesday can be what ever you'd like it to be. Could just do the fried rice again if you like. I'm guessing you'll go home first?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Kids are hard work\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know, I can already feel myself slipping\\
Normally, yes. But not sure how my brain would take it when I'm poorly\/ without spoons\\Oh yes, the rice would be lovely. Just a quiet night in.\\Definitely will need to go home first, to shower and change. But I should be back by 4.30 hopefully\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Compounded by their extreme laziness and huge level of unfitness.\\
They have absolutely zero worries about money but don’t do enough to help themselves.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well don’t fully fall over.\\
One penguin step at a time. Just do what is important.\\Ok. :thinking-face:\\Good plan for Tuesday then. You mean back to your for 4:30 not mine. Did you want me to come to you?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll be 4.30 at mine then plus time to get ready\\
I don't know. If I'm able I'll come to you :smiling-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: We can decide the finer details closer to the day.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just getting ready for bed. What are you up to?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just got back from picking up another TV :man-facepalming: which required us to have a burger for lunch and not the basic sandwich I was looking forward to :man-facepalming:\\
Now about to put in a couple of inspection hatches in the dry wall. Rick and roll :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\Hope you sleep well and find some spoons.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: X x x\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Exciting times!\\
Hope the TV mounting goes well.\\Night. Miss your face xxx\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Miss you :red-heart:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Unless you’re thinking about me and \/ or touching yourself you should be asleep.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And it appears you went to sleep straight after :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\section*{Friday $19\textsuperscript{th}$}
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00006244-GIF-2024-01-19-05-41-23.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning! I didn't, it was real struggle getting out of bed :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
How's the rest of your day been? Xx\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh I’m sorry. Last day though. You can do it. I’d hoped you found at least one spoon.\\
Days been ok. But slow really. Didn’t get nearly as much work done as I wanted. Did manage a couple of house jobs but not as many as we thought. A fair amount of waiting for Gile today and listening to rants.\\Really good dinner at a Chinese place tonight. That was fun.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That possible one spoon has been used for getting up and getting ready :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
It is what it is, gotta power through.\\Not all days have to be super full on.\\That dinner sounds yum!\\We should put china town on  the food list :smiling-face:\\Are you in bed now?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: We can add that to the list. Is it a place or an actual restaurant name?\\
I know each day doesn’t have to be crazy but today didn’t feel anymore relaxed than any other. Just less was done and I would have like to have finished my assignment. Just have to try tomorrow.\\Not yet in bed. Just about to.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: China town in Soho.\\
You'll finish it today\/tomorrow, don't worry :smiling-face:\\Just having my breakfast. Really don't want to leave :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh, we can add to the list.\\
I’m not worried, just frustrated. It will get done.\\Well done on breakfast at least. It’s either phone in sick and take the whole day or leave now before the traffic.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm definitely going in :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
I hope you sleep well. Night night xxx\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m guessing you suffering a bit extra from the gym?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, can definitely feel it!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hope the day is at least ok.\\
Your “up and not crying” hopefully.\\Chat later when I’m in the same day. X x x x :red-heart:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am up and not crying :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night xxx\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Typical for a late bed time that I’m up early (relatively) not had my alarm go off once yet.\\
Hope school has been ok.\\Will you have time for a nap before heading out tonight? Have you been able to nap at all this week?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I left school at 3.30 and only just walked through the door at home :upside-down-face:\\
Why were you up early? Did you managed to get some more sleep?\\I have had absolutely no naps this week :weary-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Wow, what a fun Friday evening drive home \/s\\
Who messed that up or did you never see an accident?\\No idea why I was up early. Probably the furness came on and then the light from the stupid blinds they have. Still got over 6 hours. So not too bad.\\Oh, well that explains a lot. Can you get one in before you go out again or is tomorrow just going to be nap day?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: There was an accident on one of the lanes down Marlow hill, roadworks down desborough road, junction 3 closed so everyone coming through 4. I spent over 30mins stuck on the roundabout.\\
Won't have time to have one today but definitely a super easy weekend ahead.\\What's your plan?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Urgh, that’s a pain. Do you use Waze just to see the trafffic?\\
You can potter around to see if you can find any spoons :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\Currently doing some work and want to finish my assignment or at least have an answer for all the questions. Then I’m not sure. Definitely a few jobs around the house to get done. Will see what happens after lunch. Giles is about to go out to see if can find out if and when their new doors will arrive that were meant to be here this week.\\When are you heading out?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Google maps, yes. But I could have only come down on J4..\\
I'm just on the couch. Need to leave in an hour.\\Productive day ahead for you. Hope the uni work goes well\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You could have done a really long backwards way from Beaconsfield but only if you knew how bad it was up front.\\
At least you have a little bit of downtime before you head out. Can attack the cat. Panto shouldn’t be super long and I hope you have a good time.\\Wish I was on the sofa with you.\\Double jinx on paired again.\\Thanks. Think it will be fine.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: A lane is taken out by being dug up by the marsh industrial estate so same that way.\\
I hope I'll be home by half 9. Wish you were here for a cuddle too.\\I know, great minds and all\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: So really you should just work from home.\\
Send me a pic of what you’re wearing to go out tonight.\\Sure, great minds or the same level of crazy.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I'm not dressing up. Just jeans and a jumper\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That doesn’t mean you can’t send a pic…\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly I don't look great. Not even putting makeup on\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: hmmm, ok. The last time I saw you after you made it clear you looked like death. You looked mildly tired. Still pretty. x x\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm just not feeling well. Wish I've given myself a night off xx\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I get it though. You've had a hard week with not enough sleep and no naps. So you want to see friends and do fun things but the energy is just not there but then there is no reward for the "suffering" of going to work. If all you did was work then why bother but you also want to feel somewhat human when interacting with friends etc.\\
Not a nice circle to be in. Do you have any evening next week that you are just staying home?\\Maybe just needs a little more planning until you change jobs.\\Be kind to yourself. Don't forget drugs\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: 3 weeks till half term?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You are exactly right. I need to see my friends and I can't let fibro and work be just it.\\
I'm hoping to have a few\\Really would love to just curl up with you\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Given that work seems to make your fibro worse it just shows that we need to focus on finding you a new job. Work is great and all (well, it makes money) but it isn't important when compared to your own health and allowing you to do things.\\
Hoping doesn't sound positive.\\I would really like that as well. Only 3 days left.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just got home. It was so cheesy but funny.\\
How's your day going?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Late for you.\\
Days going ok. I think I’ve done my assignment. Not happy with it but just not sure what I don’t know to answer the questions. Just have to see. Only 5\% of grade.\\Currently putting up window film. As I am the DIY master :grinning-face:\\I find that Panto is too cheesy for me. It’s deliberately crap in a way. Glad you enjoyed it though.\\At least now you can get some rest. Don’t forget to turn off your alarm.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Super late! When is the deadline? You can always look over it after more reading. Those little percentages add up :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Well apparently you are a DIY master. Better put you to work over here\\Oh absolutely. I wouldn't have thought you'd like it much.\\No alarms on weekends, except the furry one!\\Are you doing anything in the evening?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: They do add up but spending 2 days chasing 1\% and that getting behind just doesn’t make sense.\\
Well I’ve offered and would very much like to help you with the flat. It’s fun helping.\\Can you do anything to stop the fur beast waking you up like food out.\\Not sure what we are doing yet. Think we will watch Oppenheimer but not sure about food.\\Would very much like to be in bed with you.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And I'm definitely taking you up on that :smiling-face:\\
He doesn't get wet food in the morning so no issues there. And tbh he's been very good this week. I've been waking him up every morning\\I'd like that too, even though I wouldn't be much fun\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: We can get it all booked in. Just need to make some choices on furniture and paint. Then just go at it. Progress not perfection.\\
I would say it would be fun in the morning but no doubt I’d have kept you up all night in a very not fun way leading to no fun in the morning.\\When you stay at mine I’ll make sure the spare bed is made :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: We might need to go somewhere to look at thresholds\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Super fun date :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly, it would be\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, yes please for the spare bed just in case\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll just need to more the printer off it and you’ll need to suppress your disgust at things being in the room\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But I do want it perfect enough for it to sell in a couple of years I guess\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: If I'm desperate enough I will :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Obviously don’t want it looking shit but you’d be very suprised what people don’t see when viewing a place. It’s all about the space and as long as the wall paint isn’t offensive that’s all people see. My carpet in my living room isn’t attached to the floor. Doesn’t stop people buying it. Good \/ bad thing about Wycombe. People don’t have a lot of choice and most want to paint anyway if they buy.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I got some mouth tape to see if that helps and I’d happily try one of those mouth guard things.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Or maybe the melatonin will just knock you out\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I just want the floor to look good\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I cannot wait to try it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Putting those strips down is easy. Just need some pin nails and then thresholds\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And that bloody bathroom. That and the front door is stressing me the most\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I need to see the front door as I’ve obviously seen it but could be an easy ish fix.\\
Might just have to move past the bit where someone should do it and we can just do it\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Maybe :smirking-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s all for the making progress thing. I know there is always the thing about justice and being right but sometimes it’s about getting stuff done and then the stress is done and I really want to help get rid of stresses for you.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's very sweet. Thank you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s all for selfish reasons. You’ll be calmer and like me more :winking-face:\\
So a total win for me.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, I like you plenty already :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You all ready for bed or pottering?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Uhmmmm\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Pottering :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just about to start getting ready though\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Shouldn’t you be pottering your way to bed to rest so you can full potter tomorrow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I won't full potter tomorrow. Wake up, lazy morning, nap, clean the flat, nap, lazy evening\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Apart from the cleaning. Sound like a good day. You forgot to add bath and day dreaming about me\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh of course. Both of those things\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well I’ll with you good night then as I’m back on window tinting x x x\\
Speak tomorrow\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have a good rest of the day. Xxx\\
\section*{Saturday $20\textsuperscript{th}$}
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How did you get out of the photo on facebook?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: \url{https://uk.indeed.com/m/viewjob?jk=eae0f8c2eb0cce75&from=serp&xpse=SoCY67I3FSkQNSxSVR0LbzkdCdPP&xkcb=SoA-67M3FSkUbXQ9SB0NbzkdCdPP}\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That looks amazing! How was it?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Why am I up????\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Cold\\
Why are you awake. It’s sleep time\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know. But I don't think my body does\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was your evening?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well tell the body shhhh\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll try to get some more sleep\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Evening was ok. Finished of the window, went for a walk. Watched Oppenheimer with a pizza :man-facepalming: that’s 3 takeaway pizzas this week.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You know the trick for helping the body sleep?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh jeez. You're really doing it the American way in terms of food :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nooo\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s a nightmare\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Phone down, lights off, eyes shut\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-rolling-eyes::face-with-rolling-eyes::face-with-rolling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know that one\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And I jinxed it with spud. He definitely thought I overslept\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well I would have suggested something else but I know your still not feeling great and laughably I was trying to avoid the :face-with-rolling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Whoops, back to bed cat\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you already in bed?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well I hope you sleep well!\\
2 more days :smiling-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: For you. It’s 3 for me\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah well! Soon enough\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep, hope you get some more rest.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you.\\
Sleep tight. Night night xx\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You can’t be asleep on instagram\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Neither can you!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: But it’s not early morning for me. I’m about to get 7+ hours\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You can doom scroll later\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll sleep some more and I have naps planned :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok,\\
I am going to sleep now so chat later.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Im up. Not quite the lie in I was expecting but no matter.\\
Have you been able to sleep more?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh you're early!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I did. Managed to get back to sleep, got up had breakfast and then went for a long nap. Only been pottering for about 90mins\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: “That’s what she said”\\
What time did you think I’d get up?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s good. Do you feel better for it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I don't know. You're usually texting just as I finish work I guess\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I needed it. But I am definitely not great. Slow weekend ahead\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You’d planned for a slow weekend. With whatever pottering is.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: <attached: 00006359-GIF-2024-01-20-14-35-13.mp4>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s all I can see when you say pottering\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm just doing little jobs\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have just woken up but did you want to do a call or will that disturb the pottering\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh god I look horrendous. Give me 10 mins :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: As I said I’ve just woken up and are still in bed so I don’t look great. Not that there is much I can do about it.\\
You don’t need to do makeup or anything\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm ready :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Video call, 42 min\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok, so searching our chat. 34 uses of Birthday (now 35) and 15 uses of bday (now 16)\\
None of which list things you wanted to do other than seeing Patrica, looking to buy some boots (which we can definitely do), taking a nap and a vague response as to weather my vasectomy counted as a present. (Which I don’t think it does). I’ll start thinking.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahhah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I did suggest some restaurants :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I said it would be nice to go to either the Vietnamese in Marlow or the Italian in Little Marlow\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, then I may have overthought it.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh what did you think?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I thought I was missing some full on day time activities because I’d thought day time would be better for the tiredness\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh we can definitely do something during the day!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm open to suggestions\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s very helpful :face-with-tears-of-joy: that will depend on what it’s like for me\\
moving around. I’m expecting it to be fine and I did think we’d spend the day together.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I mean we can definitely get that dinner booked and then decide on the daytime depending on how you're feeling\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh yeah. Which restaurant would you prefer?\\
Assuming it’s a nice day I’d thought we could do a bit of a walk around Marlow.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: An overthink. What did you mean with you comment about Zane saying you looked good at the gym? There was some hidden thing that I’ve realised I’ve missed\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Omg there wasn't! I was just making fun of it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh ok. Just checking\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good that you're checking. Wouldn't want you to feel any kind of way about it <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You okay?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, just got stuck in my head that I’d missed a couple of things.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What did you think you missed?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just your birthday stuff and then thought I missed some hidden meaning with the Zane story.\\
So just checking.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You didn't, promise\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Miss your face :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Miss your face too and it was nice seeing it this morning. You looked cute.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aw thank you :smiling-face:\\
Not feeling it but it's nice to hear\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well you hide it well. You’ve always looked good.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You can tell me all the time :face-blowing-a-kiss:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Is there a spelling mistake in that last.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: ???\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Never mind I get it now.\\
Will you want food on Monday?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh don't worry, you'll only be just getting back from the gym\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: First, I worry all the time :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
I’ve got food being delivered from Morrisons so I can order anything you’d like. Don’t want you to then  have to worry about food after. I’ve no idea what I might have and it could be pretty random but happy to make sure you have something.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. I'll might have a little of whatever you're having :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You read the part where I don’t know right :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: if you think of something you’d definitely eat. I’ll buy it so that you have something as I might just be having a crap packet mix pasta or jerky.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly I can't think of anything.\\
Oh I thought you said you were going for better food when you get back?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I will be doing better food once I’m back but I’m not going to do a batch cook the day I land.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And nothing will defrost in time\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yea I keep forgetting you batch cook :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, that’s why I have to plan a bit when other people are coming to the house as all my meals that I have pre made are for one.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly don't worry about me\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well if you think of something.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How did the DIY go?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Door installed, now putting another TV on the wall.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How many TVs are they going to have??\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Theatre room only has one.\\
Giles office at least 2 maybe 3\\Kids game room at least 2\\I assume a TV in 3 of the bedrooms maybe the kids will get one as well so that’s 3 or 5\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Jeezus\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I couldn't have a TV in the bedroom\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I don’t either. Just not needed when the good one is in the living room\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Definitely! Bedrooms are for reading and sleeping :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: image omitted\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: There’s a couple of other things the bedroom is good for\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :eyes::eyes::eyes::eyes::eyes: holy crap. You are hot.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No bubbles\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just need a video of you climaxing while touching yourself in the bath.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nope :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm having a chamomile bath\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is what I expected you to say. Maybe something I can watch in person\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Maybe\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s not a no :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
TBH wouldn’t need to be in the bath.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What you might also find amusing is that I’m wearing sweatpants today and it really doesn’t take much for you to turn me on. So multiple cases of near embarrassment over the last hour or so.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I do find it amusing. Good to know I have an effect on you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s a lot of an effect\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good :smirking-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: \url{https://uk.misscosy.com/?shpxid=050b51a9-8fef-4c67-85e6-981850eb4e8c}\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ooooh so cosy. But soooo pricey\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I didn’t think the price was terrible.\\
Colour and size? <This message was edited>\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I thought it was a bit out of my range. I usually get my cosies from Primark :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Grey or black (shame the plum is out of stock) and 12\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Should have guessed black :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Plum isn’t a colour I see, they have lavender\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh I see, it was a limited  colour\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha yea\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Will see what they are like. Ordered. I think you’ll look super hot in them.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aw that's so sweet of you. You know you didn't need to!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know. I wanted to\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also... I realised I get teacher discount at love honey\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, that’s brilliant.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I really need to see your current toy collection to see what other stuff we can try\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly it's basic, fit for purpose\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, gets the job done then.\\
We should look and see about some stuff. V day is always a good excuse.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you even used them since we started dating?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No :face-with-tears-of-joy: in all honesty, I haven't been feeling super sexy since the whole work breakdown and being super poorly\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’d thought as much. Hope it comes back\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Me too\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Obviously I have a very keen interest in you feeling sexy about yourself so do let me know anything I can do to help.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think it's more feeling sexual rather than sexy. I do feel sexy. It's just hard to be in the mood with work stuff and health stuff. But knowing I'm desired is definitely good :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well the work stuff will hopefully happen \/ go away soon.\\
You are sooo desired\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :smiling-face-with-hearts::smiling-face-with-hearts::smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also just had a cute old people date idea... I'd really like to go to a cute ass garden centre to get some plants and coffee and a cake\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is an old person date. We can do that. Next weekend if you like\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Studley green one has a cafe.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have you been to nottcuts or whatever it's called?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Don’t think so. Where is it?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll have a look for some suggestions tomorrow :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sounds good. Are you in bed now?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just snuggled into bed\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What have you been up to?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Tv is on the wall, just running a network cable through a wall. Then will go for a quick walk\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Do you know what you're doing tonight?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You should give your vibrator a quick blast to see if it helps you sleep better. The whole responsive desire thing.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No idea yet\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Too tired now\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope you have a great last evening\/night with Giles.\\
Miss you loads and can't wait to see you soon\\Night night xxx\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: The machine does it all for :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes but the head needs to be in the game\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I get it. I’ll stop.\\
\section*{Sunday $21\textsuperscript{st}$}
Night x x x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00006478-GIF-2024-01-21-06-01-23.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning!\\
Hope you are sleeping well.\\Glad you had a good night xxx\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ooh, looking sexy! :smiling-face-with-heart-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Maybe I need to buy a salmon jacket then.\\
How are you doing today?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hello! Did you sleep well?\\
I haven't had a great morning so just taking it easy.\\Haha, was it not yours?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Slept ok. Not bad but not great. A few more minutes would have been nice.\\
Jacket was my friends. Amazing it fit me, initially sceptical of the colour but I like it.\\Of I’m sorry, did something happen?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully you'll be tired enough to sleep on the plane.\\
Then you should definitely get one :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\I had what can only describe as a fatigue attack. Perfectly alright in the morning. Got up, made coffee, planned to go to the gym. Was brushing my teeth and then all of a sudden I was so tired I could barely hold myself up and had to go back to bed. First time it's happened but I checked with other fibro gals and apparently it's quite a normal fibro thing\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll get a few hours in the plane for sure but will just have to see. Not super normal for me to be able to sleep in the afternoon \/ evening.\\
Oh! That doesn’t sound good at all and scary if it’s the first time it’s happened. Sounds similar to what I’d expect to happen if drugs were making you tired. Did you get some more sleep?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Or low blood pressure\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Definitely a fibro thing, apparently quite common. It's so much fun discovering new symptoms \/s\\
Not really, but I did stay in bed for another couple hours. It was a bit scary\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: My blood pressure is apparently perfection - they test me quite regularly\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you doing anything before you head off?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How do you feel now?\\
Doesn’t sit right with me that a new symptom can be dismissed by others “oh yeah you have this now as well”\\Something has to cause it.\\Not sure what we might be doing. I could really do with starting a chapter and Giles is picking up another TV. I’ve got to pack. So, super fun stuff.\\This is where I now just want to be home. <This message was edited>\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm feeling better. Had an easy day, did some marking and now just thinking about what to make for food.\\
Something is causing it - fibro. Unfortunately the list of symptoms\/side effects is massive and not all of us have them all or at the same time. Sometimes they just go in a cycle\\Super fun stuff. Don't miss your plane.\\I just want you to be home too!\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: \url{https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGeMC8peh/}\\
:eyes::eyes::eyes::eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you already made soup?\\
Glad you’re feeling better.\\Have you done any job advert today? Did you look at the one I sent you.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yes! I wanted to make soup. Thanks for the reminder :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone: I completely forgot.\\
I have looked at it but crypto is not my thing\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was the compliance part of it I thought you might like and it was remote. Could have been a place holder to get out of teaching\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: This looks awesome. That would be so much fun.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I knooooow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Spring time?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Could do. Will be mega money if it school holiday\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The thing is I'm not a job hopper and I do love my job in its basic form. It's the heath stuff that's making me look elsewhere so I really want to find something that I'll be good at and at least like. Not just the job, but also industry. I know it might sound idealistic but it's been hard even coming to terms that I have to leave a career I am bloody good at and thought I'd be in till retirement\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah it's about £530 the weekend begining of may half term\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I totally get that. I never job hopped and it would be great if you could find a company you liked to start. My thoughts are probably a little different. School is making you sicker so the problem that needs solving is not working at school.\\
Especially given the stupid long notice period you have to give.\\Then if the school problem is solved it leaves the problem of a job you like. They can be 2 problems that get solved separately. Nice to solve both\\\url{https://www.canopyandstars.co.uk/britain/england/yorkshire/meg-s-farm/the-quarryman-s-bothy}\\Found it. Adds up fast just for a few nights\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: They have some cool stuff in Sussex\\
\url{https://www.canopyandstars.co.uk/britain/england/sussex/wilderness-wood/yaffle}\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I get your point. It's just it's important to me to believe in the industry one way or another, and crypto is not it for me. Just have zero interest in it.\\
I have until 31st of may to find something (unless a miracle happens by end of Feb)\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: They can happen. Just got to keep plugging away at applying.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That is sooo coool . £500 may half term :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Might just have to wait until I'm not teaching\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I did have a crazy job thought. Quit teaching as soon as they will let you and then do supply teaching until you find a job?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I had an email from the tax specialist programme today, through to next stage (3 of 5milion). Strengths test\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That was my thought. It will be half price\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s great.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Noooooooo. Who's paying my bills? Not supply rates. And the uncertainty every day, nope nope\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s what I thought but I’m an options person. I thought supply teachers get paid a lot.\\
Like being a contractor. Triple money\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just some uncertainty\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Absolutely not. Way below my pay grade, no paid holidays or sick leave\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm an experienced teacher paid on upper pay scale. Very few jobs match that to be honest\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Easy answer then.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Which is?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not to be a supply teacher\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha yes, absolutely\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Totally different in IT. I could have done £600 a day as a contractor if I’d have taken the chance\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes very different in corporate\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's why I'm not applying to hundreds of jobs. I can only take a little paycut with the mortgage and bills and all. Which makes it hard switching careera\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It certainly isn’t easy.\\
I think that why a lot of people stay in the first job they have. Very hard to switch once you start earning above the minimum and fear gets in the way\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's not even fear. I think I'm being practical - I must pay bills. It's not like I have family or anything like that to fall back on in case something happens\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Something will come up! It has to\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Fear was more of a generic reason. Not specifically meant at you. But yes bills do need to be paid. They ruin  all the fun.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They do ruin all the fun\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You're not satisfied with hug frequency?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You know I can't reply on paired :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well I haven’t had a hug in 10 days. So no. The frequency is not high enough.\\
I need to give you more space?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: If you scroll down do you get a discuss option or rotate the phone OR get an iPhone :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No, I don't need more space\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Rubbish,\\
Your answer to Q5 implies I’m not giving you enough space\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh soz\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thus the checking plus it’s the thing I’m very sensitive too\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I like when you check\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And  checking terrifies me so that all works out great :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You know you can always check with me. I'd rather you do that than get stuck in your head.\\
Cards on the table and all that\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know and I need to get better at it as my brain just says what ever I say will get dismissed so why ask or check.\\
I managed to get proper stuck yesterday and fell down a hole around you being annoyed at me for wanting to have sex with you and that you didn’t want to touch me.\\Stupid brain.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You know me better than that. I wouldn't just dismiss what you say.\\
Oh jeez. And you didn't tell me? Why wouldn't I want to touch you?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was a spiral I needed to get out of first and I thought it would annoy you.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It wouldn't have annoyed me\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m not even sure what the specific trigger was but it was very strange. Not sure if I should explain but I’ll try and probably some of it might come across wrong but remember rule 2\\
You sent me that awesome picture (which id like as a permanent one for my collection) which obviously turned me on a bit (quite a lot).\\I know your not feeling the best and not feeling sexual so then you not wanting to pleasure yourself (which makes perfect sense when you feel crappy) just flipped an old switch in my brain that I’m worthless and of course women don’t feel sexual around me. Makes perfect sense that I’d turn you off. The spiral continued from there.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh bubs :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't feel sexual because I am broken and so so tired. So yes, it might not be the best to suggest pleasuring myself because my head is just not there. And then I feel like I'm not giving you what you want\/need and have my own lovely spirals :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
That does not make perfect sense, just so you know. And I cannot stress enough that you are not worthless. I'm not with you for some unknown reason. I'm choosing to be with you, I'm choosing YOU every day\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know I’d doesn’t make logical sense but it made sense in the spiral.\\
That’s not good if you’re spiraling as well.\\I’m choosing you as well.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Tell the spirals to shush!\\
Assume positive intent.\\Btw, there's a big storm here so hopefully your flight will be okay x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I saw the news about the storm. Hopefully it just makes for a bumpy landing, if anything.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Fingers crossed because you'd better be home tomorrow!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know. I have shopping arriving at 12:30 :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh it's the shopping you're worried about??\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well I don’t want it left on the door step in the rain.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-rolling-eyes::face-with-rolling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: So not this amazing woman you'll get to see?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well there is that as well. I’m a bit worried I’ll be a disappointment and \/ or say something stupid.\\
I am really looking forward to seeing you.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not to bang on about it but what can we do to help you with your headspace. As things rarely improve through hoping.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Can you shush with these worries :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
But on a serious note. Am I doing something that is making you feel like that?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly, I don't know. I think I'm extra in my head due to therapy (gets worse before it gets better).\\
And it's really hard being all sexy etc when my whole body feels like it's on fire. We'll just have to figure out a way around it\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: What feel like I’m a disappointment. No.\\
I just know you’re excited to see me (which again I struggle with understanding sometimes. Only sometimes before you eye roll)\\So I don’t want it to be a disappointing experience for you.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Why would it be a disappointing experience for me?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Maybe something to bring up in therapy? And I know the pill + SSRI’s cannot help and probably nearly switch you completely off.\\
As long as it is something we can work on together.\\It will be better after tomorrow. I rarely go this long with touching myself. So I can sort that when I get home. Then I’ll be much less of a sex pest.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sex pest :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Because I have a low opinion of myself. Keep up :face-with-tears-of-joy:.\\
But I know you can build these thing up in your head and then be disappointed with the reality. Just don’t want to disappoint\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm not building anything up. I'm looking forward to seeing a man I like that I haven't hugged in almost 2 weeks\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ok?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Didn’t know what else to say. Feel like a bit of a dick now who’s pressured into more things to think about \/ worry about when I was trying to be a source of calm for you.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You haven't pressured me into anything\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But I do need one thing from you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: When I say a thing, you must believe it. And remember it for next time you don't think nicely about yourself. And no more putting yourself down\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know and I know you’ve said it before. Think I’m just having a particularly bad 24 hours on the back of a no exercise week and stupidly crap food, which makes me feel like crap.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I get it. Once you're back in routine and sort the food out you'll be good! And I'm here for you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Dinner availability for tomorrow might be even less than expected. My shopping got cancelled :man-facepalming:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh nooooo. Why?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: My credit card has gone funny despite my app saying it is all fine. All reordered for Tuesday\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You could always pop out for basics worst case scenario\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s the new plan.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you all ready to go?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Pretty much. It’s all packed. Will be leaving in 20 or so\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ooooh :beaming-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Slight delay  to take off but early arrival is showing\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Early arrival is good\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Btw I'm getting my hair cut shorter tomorrow and probably going a bit darker\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :eyes::eyes:\\
I didn’t think you were going to get it cut longer\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh btw, we don't need to keep the Italian on Saturday list... Michelle just said she's taking me on Wednesday :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just wanted to tell you so you don't have a shock :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Marlow it is then.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :smiling-face-with-hearts::smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Do you not have a councillor session tomorrow as well?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nope we didn't book this week\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just leaving for airport. Should have WiFi but will wish you good night just in case.\\
Night x x x\\Sorry about the spiralling .\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. Pop me a message before your flight if you can.\\
Have a safe flight and come back to me in one piece.\\Xxx\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And don't apologise xxx\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: At the airport. Hunting for food\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Random thought about Saturday. Did you want to do parkrun \/ see YPOM people in Starbucks? We could go from there to a garden centre if you like or go for \/ after lunch.\\
\section*{Monday $22\textsuperscript{nd}$}
I’ll book the restaurant in Marlow. I’m guessing early. 6pm? I can do all the driving (probably)\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Other thought. When do you find out next steps on the HMRC job?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just starting to board now.\\
Speak to you tomorrow once a land. Hope school goes well and I really can’t explain just how much I am looking forward to seeing you.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning!\\
Hope the flight was good and you managed to sleep some.\\Yup, would like to go parkrun, probably to walk it. And yes to garden centre after.\\6 is perfect ( you know me so well :face-with-tears-of-joy:). I'm happy to do driving if you can't.\\I need to do the test at some point this week.\\Speak when you're back on this side of the world\\Xxx\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Landed. Will message you when I get home.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Home. Just starting to unpack.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Welcome back!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Happy to help with the test if you like\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was the flight?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: flight was good. Quite fast. Think I got 4 hour sleep. Maybe a smidge more. Food was questionable\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No passport queue which was nice\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you super tired?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not yet. Just fuzzy. Need a shower etc to try and humanise myself\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Will hunt for some food in the house.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How’s your day going?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope you manage to find something\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's been fine\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: There is stuff, just that thing where you don’t really know and don’t want to choose.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I know the feeling\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I always have cereal when I can't decide\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll probably do a protein shake for the vitamins and minerals and see what else I can find.\\
Looking forward to seeing you later.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Looking forward to seeing you too :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How are you feeling?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Pretty good. Expected levels of fuzziness but nothing I wasn’t expecting.\\
Have had a couple of moments where I went to do something and then immediately forgot what it was :face-with-tears-of-joy:.\\How about you?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah that's my daily life :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
It was alright. It's y13 parents evening so the kids left at 2 so had 1.5hrs quiet time. Just got to the hairdresser, she's running a bit late. Don't know how long this will take but will text when I'm leaving\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hannah at 5?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep, at 5. As long as I don’t fall asleep in the next 15 minutes :grinning-face:.\\
Oh, nice to get a bit of time. I assume they don’t let you go home.\\Let me know on times. You might want to let yourself in depending on the time as I might be in the shower.\\258369*\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope the session is good!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I should be about another 30mins\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Great. Just walked through the door myself. I should be out of the shower by then but you can let yourself in.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just leaving\\
Should be 20 mins\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok. See you in a bit.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Really really great seeing you. Hair is amazing, just like you.\\
Hope spud isn’t too upset\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just parked up.\\
Honestly, I am so happy you're back. Can't stop grinning.\\Glad you like the hair :smiling-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Aww, it’s nice to be wanted and I’m really pleased to home.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You are very much wanted\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've smashed mcds :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is allowed\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It was lush, just what I needed :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't forget paired!!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Done. Nearly forgot :man-facepalming:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's why I reminded you :winking-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you in bed yet?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not yet no but the tiredness is coming fast.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You did look tired (in a positive way). I'm just getting ready\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thanks :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Is it even possible to look positively tired\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Like I said it in a caring way :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm in bed now. Hope you sleep well and get some rest.\\
Night night xxx\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m on my way there now. Night x x x\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm glad you're back xx\\
\section*{Tuesday $23\textsuperscript{rd}$}
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00006649-GIF-2024-01-23-05-54-23.mp4>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you try the drugs?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you and morning!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I did!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So they work then?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Seem to! :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How did you sleep?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s great\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I feel like I slept well\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Slept ok. Just woke up before my alarm but great to be in my own bed again.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I bet! Glad you had some rest. How are you feeling?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Head is a bit fuzzy. Which is expected. Will just have to see. Otherwise feel fine.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Otherwise fine is good! Maybe the spin will sort out the fuzziness\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll soon find out :face-with-tears-of-joy:. Think spin is going to hurt but it has to help.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, it will :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I hope school goes well today and I’m looking forward to seeing you again later.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you. Looking forward to seeing you too :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Survived spin. Maybe the altitude offset not doing anything for over a week.\\
A few random thoughts.\\Need some dates to try and arrange some double dates.\\Is your school guy going to fix your floor or are we \/ someone else going to do it? I have a carpenter guy who is very good and would probably do the work after school as a thing on his way home.\\Is it just a fiat 500 you want to buy or any car that size? What’s the price range?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well done on spin!\\
Yes we do, I'm booked on weekends until 10th Feb\\He could but he's super busy so don't want to bug him. Yes please to your carpenter guy if he can.\\No, not necessarily just that. Ford KA is up top, fiat 500 after, and then anything of similar size but minimum 1.2 engine. 4k probably and if they could take mine that would be better\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: What’s you car registration?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Including the 10th? That’s the start of half term as well right?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well, finding a car is going to be easy. There are loads.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: FP59MXN\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes and yes :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I completely forgot to order pudding for tonight should I pick some up on the way back from the gym?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't worry. I definitely need to stop in the shop on my way home because I have nothing for breakfast for tomorrow.\\
What shall I pick up?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: What ever you would like. I normally get one of the gu things or cheesecake.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki I'll have a look in Aldi\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your day going?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Going ok. Had no issue waking up but the brain is slow. Have done some work and hoping this afternoon’s PT session will help with the reset.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Saw this mentioned on the fibro subreddit. Ever heard of it\\
\url{https://www.apa.org/ptsd-guideline/treatments/eye-movement-reprocessing}\#:~:text=A\%20structured\%20therapy\%20that\%20encourages,associated\%20with\%20the\%20trauma\%20memories.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh do you have a PT session?\\
What time?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you.I've heard of it but never tried it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: 3pm. Just to get a leg session in before my forced break.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Also, \url{https://www.nhs.uk/medicines/melatonin/how-and-when-to-take-melatonin/}\\
So those gummies are 30mg (apparently) and by this article the NHS would only give out 3mg ones.\\My take away was that they might not be good for long term daily use and it might need to see about getting lower dose ones prescribed.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Seems lengthy and complicated but something else to try. A few people said it helped them indirectly.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yes, very sensible. I keep forgetting it's tomorrow!\\
Where are you getting it done?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well everything is bigger in America :face-with-tears-of-joy: I'm not going to take them every day. But it was definitely nice just falling asleep and getting some rest\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It done at Maidenhead. Fortunately the guy who does it is one of the best in the county and most people have said they were fine after a few days. Plus I have ice packs and some terrible underwear arriving today.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you notice the difference then in falling asleep and did it keep you from waking up during the night?\\
The sleep profile from the watch was better than I’ve done over the last few weeks\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I want to see the undies!\\
Will you be alright getting there and back? What time is it?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I definitely did notice a difference\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s interesting. I might have to try them then. Especially after tomorrow.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: They should arrive today. Meant to be supportive.\\
Matt is taking me. As he isn’t working I managed to ask him. It a 3:30 appointment. So I should be home by 5.\\I would have asked my brother if it was earlier in the day as I took him to his one.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did you want me to come around?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I thought you were out for dinner?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That wasn't the question :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’d already assumed you were busy because you said you were busy.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m torn. It would be nice to see you but I also don’t need to hurt myself by you turning me on.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Plus your busy\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Michelle is picking me up at 7 so I could pop straight from work for literal 10mins?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That could work, assuming I’m back early enough. You might have to let yourself in.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And I’d certainly like you help for the Rehabilitation work needs to be done.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy:of course you would!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll be leaving here at about 5.10\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It will all be a lot easier and faster with your help.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll obviously text when I’m on the way home. If I’m later than I think we can re plan.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But I'll only be able to stay for a quick "hope you're well" cuddle\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What time do you finish in the gym today?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: 4:30\\
I have also just realised I don’t have any spring onion :man-facepalming:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m guessing you’ll be at mine for about 6?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I can pick you up if that is any help.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll get some!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, that will work!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It can obviously be earlier if it happens.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: A super nice and casual paired question today :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haven't seen it yet\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The new underwear leave absolutely nothing to the imagination :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was gym?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just home, sorting phonecalls\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Gym was good but hard. As it should be. No point leaving thinking you could do more. I really dislike the hamstring curl machine. It’s evil :angry-face-with-horns:.\\
Enjoy. No rush.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I hate it soooo much.\\
Right going into shower will text when I'm on the way. Got pud and spring onions. Anything else I should bring?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just yourself\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Careful what you wish for :face-with-tears-of-joy::smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have no idea how to respond to that.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahahaha\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I wouldn't know either\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: If you need some space I could just bring you food?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Noooooo\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It was just a joke\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Like a flirty one. Obviously I'm so good at them :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, I went in a completely different direction\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: See you in a bit\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What did you think????\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Let me shower first\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I still need to\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: My first thought was that it meant you were in a bad mood because you said you hated the phone calls. Matched with the comments about tomorrow where you said twice it would only be a flying visit, if it happens at all.\\
Just made me wonder if I’m not respecting you time.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Rule \#2\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I said it was going to be a flying visit because I feel a bit guilty that I won't be able to spend more time with you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You know I'm very good with boundaries, I'd tell you if it were the case\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know, it was just because the messages flowed together.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just feeding the cat and on my way\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm home\\
Thank you so much for tonight. The prezzies, the food, the orgasms. The lot. I like you loads\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You’re very welcome. I like making food and really like giving you orgasms.\\
I like you loads to.\\You trying out the drugs for bed again?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not tonight. I have a feeling I'm going to sleep really well tonight :face-blowing-a-kiss:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, I hope so. Will be an interesting experiment. Melatonin vs orgasms\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Off topic \url{http://www.autotrader.co.uk/car-details/202311093788651}\\
As an example.\\What tax is the corsa?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's older than mine. And it has to be ulez compliant the whole time I have it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Tax wise I'm not sure. Around £120 a year I think\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That one is ULEZ but will make sure. Didn’t look at the age.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't worry. Thank you for looking into it for me\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: We can have a proper look closer to half term.\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They are not my dream cars :face-with-tears-of-joy: just example\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Don’t lose sleep car shopping\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm not. Just pottering on my way to bed :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Of course, you have do pottering before bed time.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What can I say :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I need to wind down after all the excitement\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s what the orgasms are meant to do\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: If I stayed in bed! Not after food and laughs\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh, so we should have sorted at least one more before you left\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I was too full :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: So so sexy\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well we did eat late. If everything had started at 4 then it might have worked\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Stupid work\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I was about to say. The solution is to not work.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well I did play Euromillions for Friday :woman-shrugging-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: 10 mill is all you need. Well 5 would do. 1 would be great but not enough for whole life\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup, I don't need much\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Maybe with 5 you could do a personal chief and cleaner\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oooooooh\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: A nice little house too\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: A house was implied but not having to cook or clean is the new dream. Then maybe a driver\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no. I like driving\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s quite nice being a passenger princess\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well you do have a designated driver\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm never not going to be able to drive because I've had a drink\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: True\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You can be my passenger princess :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, sold.\\
We need to plan a lazy day date. Maybe somewhere around half term. See how high we can get your orgasm count.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We can definitely plan a lazy day date\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But we need to plan some activity ones too!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yes. Saturday will count as an activity? But I do have some of our list.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes Saturday definitely will. I'm really looking forward to it. Hoping you won't be in pain\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Me too. Will just have to see. Can always walk like I’ve lost my horse.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Right, snuggled in bed with the cat.\\
Night night you wonderful man. Sleep well xx\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I found some amazing Simpson’s lounge wear I’ll be trying this week.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night x x x x x x x x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Very baggy super thin “jogging” trousers. Like pyjamas but a bit thicker. With Homer Simpson everywhere\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah, brill!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night xxx\\
\section*{Wednesday $24\textsuperscript{th}$}
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, I love them\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x\\
How did you sleep?\\I have very much been thinking about last night :smirking-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00006809-GIF-2024-01-24-08-22-31.mp4>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Seems like I slept well but a bit fuzzy. Not sure if that’s the drugs or expected jet lag. Think it’s the jet lag.\\
:winking-face: that’s good. Did it help you sleep at all or are the drugs better?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What's your plan for the day before the snippy snip?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Much more deep sleep then?\\
Plan is to just work. Want to finish a chapter and submit my assignment\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Seems like it. I do feel like I slept\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s really good :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:. So multiple orgasms beat the drugs. More experiments required :winking-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha. Indeed. Only empirical evidence accepted\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Exciting. Will need control days, then to see the optimal number or if the number correlates to any part of sleep and to see if you doing vs me doing it makes any difference.\\
Drugs on their own and drugs plus orgasms.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Proper experiment\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How are you feeling about later on?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well if I’m going to be a scientist then I really should start practicing :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Fine. I’ve tried not to think about it too much and I know a few people who have had it and it not be that big of a deal.\\
I’ve no doubt it will be awkward for me but not the dr. Something I should have done a long time ago I think. Then it would be done and wouldn’t be bothering me.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Table is booked for Saturday\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well it's getting done now. Better late then never :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
What kind of anesthesia are you having?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: None. It’s some sort of local injection. I’m not being knocked out.\\
Which is a shame but quicker recovery\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah that's good! Hopes you won't feel a thing\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sure I won’t. Not until it wears off\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I won't even be able to kiss it better :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, you can save that until next week\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okay okay :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: First time could be interesting\/ painful.\\
I’ve read about people who tried a bit too soon after and instantly regretted it. Need to try and do with as little movement as possible :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We can give it a go in about 10 days depending on how you feel\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: But but the instructions only say to wait a week :face-with-tears-of-joy: although I suspect next week I won’t see you until the Saturday which would be 10 days.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Why am I not going to see you?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I thought you were busy. Wednesday is your long work day so might not see you and then I thought you were out Thursday and I know your out Friday.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Doesn’t mean I didn’t think I’d see you Monday or Tuesday. Although I think Monday you have book club and counselling so maybe I’d see you Tuesday.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Bookclub is once a month, it's just I have two :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Yeah maybe Tuesday, we can arrange on Saturday :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: So I nearly got it right.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, yea\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What time are you leaving?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Something picked up at 2:45\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That was meant to say being picked up.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, I know\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Soups good.\\
We have until 7:30 at the restaurant on Saturday. So plenty of time to get you home before you turn into a pumpkin\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm glad you like it :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Brill, we can have a little stroll after if it's not raining\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope all the snippy snip goes well. Thinking of you and your balls x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thanks. Will let you know how it goes.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: On by way home now\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Was very odd\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh what do you mean?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just an odd experience, very professional, as I would expect. Very chatty.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did you feel anything? <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just a lot of pulling\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ewwww\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And beeping from the machine\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not hurting?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not yet\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Odd getting the injection\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I bet!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Do you need me to grab anything on my way?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I can’t think of anything.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I should be home in 10\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm still here for another half hours or so\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok, just pop in when your ready\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: \url{https://emea01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FVCI9s5siCHY&data=05%7C02%7C%7C872bd9e4228b41f84ffc08dc1cf5d679%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C638417089406646170%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=h8s2ZP0xURWxIRGzI%2B4bS795uevAkaMyf%2FfbKBVzrP8%3D&reserved=0}\\
If you want to have a watch later. Not urgent\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm glad I could pop in on you tonight. Hope you didn't freeze them off\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: As always, it was nice seeing you as well. Time goes so fast when you’re around.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Enjoy dinner\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I hope that's a good thing :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you. Don't do anything and let me know if you need anything\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: \url{https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGer21x1f/}\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: \url{https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGerY7c7A/}\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It is a good thing but would be helpful if it slowed down so we could spend more time together and then we also wouldn’t have to eat dinner so late.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thank you. I will but I should be fine.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Both of those place look very nice. Would you survive a drive to Cornwall?\\
Need to get out of school holidays so we can get these cheap trips away booked.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Fancy.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We'll spend more time together :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly, I don't know. Maybe with a reasonable stretch breaks I would. I'd be alright driving, I think. I did drive to Blackpool and I was alright\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am so full. The portions are massive. We should definitely come back here.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You back home now?\\
For our first holiday we can pick a closer place just to make sure\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think I know which one you went to. Can defo go back.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not yet, just leaving.\\
Oki, that sounds like a good plan\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your evening been?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Full rock and roll as you would expect. I’ve sat where you saw me since you left. Got up for food and ice packs. Just about to repeat drugs and ice packs.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I can see you did. Just got home\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What sleep experiment are you trying tonight?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Magnesium\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Is that different to a normal night or is this a new variable to add?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No not really, but will be good to see how it compares\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: We will call this normal then.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okay :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What else did you find on Reddit?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not much. More memes, some fibro stuff, 3D printing, wood turning, bitcoin.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know you don't think much of it, but it does mean a whole lot to me that you're looking into fibro :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s good then.\\
I like learning and seeing how it affects other people and what other people find works etc. might stumble across something that might help.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You might. And I appreciate it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The only problem with any theory is that the body is a bit shut at reacting quickly to change. So any idea takes quite a while to see if it helps, hinders or does nothing.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yes, I know. I've been trialing so many things for the last few years\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not just for fibro but over the last year or so I have started to see a bit and wonder that we don’t really fully understand the importance of hormones beyond the obvious for reproduction. They seem critical in both men and women in just simply making the body work properly.\\
Then there are a lot of minerals we are all naturally low in due to our diets that seem to have effects.\\I wonder if some of it is very much like how I used to feel when I was super unfit, ate crap and felt rubbish but I didn’t know I felt like rubbish until I stopped.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh you're absolutely right.\\
You often don't see things not being right until you change the situation and look back\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Dinner, ice pack on my private’s, holidays, sex memes , sleeping and science. You never know what we’ll talk about.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And I love that :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did you take the melatonin last night?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I did. I think it did something and I woke up this morning feeling fuzzy. Not sure if that the melatonin or just the jet lag.\\
It felt jet laggy\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well at least you'll be getting some lay ins this week :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s true. I got a bit used to them in Denver. It’s both good and bad not having to get up early. I don’t seem to get any more or less work done either way. Just no workout.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: But the more I rest now the better\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: All I’ve got to do over the next 2 days is 2 chapters and 1 assignments question. Then I’m pretty much caught up.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's brilliant! You'll get that done no problem\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Should do. Are you out tomorrow or do you actually have an evenings rest?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I need to pick up a SAD lamp from Naphill on the way back from work and that's it. I'll do gym on Friday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: SAD lamp?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s good though. You can potter and find spoons\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Your out Friday evening as well?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Seasonal affective disorder. Basically it helps with the dark. It was free on one of the sites\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nooooooooo\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's like a special kind of light\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh nice, that might help a lot with the tiredness. Especially if you use it in the morning.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's what I'm thinking. I've been wanting it for ages but they can be pricey\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I seem to be the only person but I really think people don’t take light seriously when sleeping\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ve already said (probably) I think you need extra blinds in your room\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I mean I make do with what I have. I'm hoping once the blinds are in it wil be better\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I still can’t get my room dark enough in the summer\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It will need proper measurements\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Can all be done.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are both of yours the special dark ones (absolutely cannot think of the proper name)?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Both the blind and curtains are black out but still bleed around the edges\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah they tend to\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Is there a lamp post in front of your house?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And the whole street\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Your other room is on the other side no?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Spare room? Same side of the house. That has blinds as well\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh for some reason I thought it faced the garden. I'm still struggling with that floor of your house :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Garden side is my office and 3D printer room\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aaaah\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Spare room could probably benefit from curtains\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: If it looks like you’ll sleep in there a lot I’ll get it all sorted\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Let's see how we do :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: With the sleeping\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I did get that\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just making sure :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you tell Michelle about what happened to me today?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: This is FB and instagram keep chowing me now along with what I ordered the other day.\\

Is that okay?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah it’s fine. I’ve told a surprising number of people\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh okay. I got worried there\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not what the procedure was then?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: If I didn’t want people to know I would have pre warned you.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: She asked if it was the snip like 2 secs after and I was uhmmm aaah\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Haha\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: She knows I don't want kids so must have been the first thing she thought of\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you sure it was okay. Sorry if I wasn't meant to mention anything\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yes. I just said it was and I would have said in advance if it was going to be a problem.\\
The only people I’m not super keen on finding out is my parents but no doubt they will find out.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s a legit reason why I have to kiss the gym, running etc\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Miss\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Miss\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okay. Just had a rush of anxiety :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :face-with-rolling-eyes::face-with-rolling-eyes:\\
Yay, I never get to use this emoji when it not aimed at me :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahahah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't worry I don't discuss our more private things\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m not even sure what good excuse I could use to get explain the not exercising\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have no delusions that women don’t discuss sex with their friends. As long as it’s good stuff as bad stuff we should discuss together\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Actually, if I'm with a partner I don't tend to discuss sex in any kind of detail\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: With friends I mean\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, I’d have assumed something is talked about at some point.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm just thinking about it and we haven't actually talked partner sex stuff\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: We can save that\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What do you mean?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Given that it’s your bed time\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just winding down so I have a bit of time\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What questions have sprung to mind then?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I haven’t really discussed any sex stuff with friends beyond answering yes to the “have you slept together yet”\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's pretty much it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And "was it good?" :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That as well.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Is that what you meant by partner sex stuff?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I meant I haven't discussed it with the girls\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They ask more stuff like do you like him, how's it going, etc\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They know it's hard for me to let the walls down :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh I see.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I get the “how’s it going question” as well.\\
I think once people have established if you are or aren’t having sex they interest is done. Especially if the answer is yes. People done want that much info about their friends.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah I've got friends that would :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: but don't worry you don't know those :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: One of my friends has shared stuff but unprompted then there were follow up questions. Rather than an interrogation from the group\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So does that mean you’ve told them stuff?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No I haven't\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm just saying they would ask :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’d only mind if you were sharing negative stuff as that should be personal\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: There isn't anything negative, is there?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You know if I had anything to say you'd be the first person I'd talk to\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m not really sure we have done enough yet to be in any place to complain.\\
Not that I am complaining.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I have nothing to complain about :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Especially after last night\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Last night was brilliant. Felt like the first time it was just fun and natural\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did the other times not feel like that?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Or maybe I should say the first time I didn’t get super stuck in my head <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What did you get stuck in about before?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Is this going well, is she enjoying herself, am I being a super clumsy oaf, if she isn’t having fun this won’t happen again etc.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, yes, no, of course it will\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Wasn’t actually expecting answers it was just some of the thoughts.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha I know\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I enjoy being with you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well that’s good :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: I enjoying being with you as well.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I was just thinking today that somehow it all feels longer than 2 months\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah it does.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: In a good way\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yes :man-facepalming:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Why the face palm?:rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think it’s because we started in November and it’s now basically the end of Jan but somehow only just 2 months.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Because I would have said if it was a bad thing\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think for me is more the feeling I get around you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It wasn't a question :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Aww,\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What can I say. I'm soppy weirdo\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Like in your pants?\\
Had to make joke.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-rolling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: But also hopefully in the pants\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, in the pants too\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That could be you new nickname\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Right, bedtime before I say more soppy stuff\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Weirdo\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You're welcome to say it back\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :woman-shrugging-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Say what back, that I have feelings as well?\\
I do.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s what I’ve sort of been saying when I’ve said that things have been scary or strange.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You know I don't get the sort of kind of stuff\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good to know. Well, you make me feel things and not in my pants.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What kind of things?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: OMG, just good things. I feel good when I’m around you.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I assumed they were good things\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just was angling for specifics :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Clearly and I’d have no idea how to articulate them at the moment.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Anyway, bed time for you or you’ll invalidate the test\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't worry :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I worry all the time :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just the subject matter changes\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope you sleep well and there's no pain\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night xxx\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thanks. I’m a little afraid to actually go to bed for that very reason.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Will do another ice pack and more drugs at 11\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night x x x\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: <attached: 00007056-GIF-2024-01-24-22-32-40.mp4>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: A quick little story for you for when you wake up.\\
\section*{Thursday $25\textsuperscript{th}$}
Obviously I spoke about you when I was out with Giles. He hasn’t ever met any of my girlfriends other than my ex wife but in conversation he was aware of them and asked about them.\\His words “You talk about Lucy differently than the others”\\He meant this in a positive way.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x\\
Hope you slept well. How are you feeling? Has the numbing gone?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00007059-GIF-2024-01-25-07-27-28.mp4>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Morning. I slept but not the best and I think it was my own fault.\\
I’m fine but I must have moved funny at some point yesterday. As I went to bed and was getting changed there was blood everywhere. I’m fine.\\No pain just blood. Seems like there fancy silicone plasters are just shit. So after fixing that I’ve been a bit nervous about how I move. Tried to sleep on my back which worked and I just have been snoring something awful.\\Just about to start living around and check myself out. More drugs.\\No pain which is great.\\I think the numbing wore off pretty quick into the evening.\\How was your sleep? <This message was edited>\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh popette. Please be careful, that doesn't sound great. Minimal movement today please. I can bring you food or something on my way back ?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Doesn’t sound great but all seems fine. The bruising has kicked in. That’s the plan for today anyway. Minimal movement.\\
I’m all sorted for food thanks but I’m not going to say no to a flying visit. If you wanted.\\Missing an hour of sleep but more REM\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okay but let me know if you need anything. I know you say you're not a good patient but I want to make it easier for you.\\
I'll see what my timings are but I will be passing through yours anyway so might pop in to make you a cup of tea :smiling-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thank you.\\
With your sleep there is still a stand out amount more deep sleep (an hour more) from orgasms than anything else and only 20 mins total difference from last night.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha. I like your research findings\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Me to. Much more testing to do but it was the middle amount of sleep in terms of length but a lot more deep sleep.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Might need to start labelling the screen shots\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So, I’ve labelled them so far and started an album :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, love it!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't know what I should take tonight then\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Either need to repeat a previous or try a new parameter. As your not going out you’d have time for any option\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: My y13s decorated my classroom and bought me flowers :pleading-face::pleading-face::pleading-face::pleading-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Aww, that’s super nice.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm crying\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They have been doing every year for like 4 years now\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s so nice. You clearly have a positive effect on people.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly I'm bawling my eyes in the office :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Soppy weirdo\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: But I get that this is the bit teachers love\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: This kinda thing just makes the shit kinda worth it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s just a shame the good doesn’t out weigh the bad\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh and you're getting a bottle of wine :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh nice.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I do need to start drinking wine\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Do you? :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well I have a fair amount of wine and I’m not sure what it’s waiting for.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have a specific bottle I bought for “something” but I’m not sure what the “something” is now and at this point it might be vinegar.\\
I had thought either PhD acceptance or for an anniversary\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: And I have fancy bubbles as well that should be drank\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'd love to drink fancy bubbles with you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But alas\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Exactly. Maybe just need to sort some double dates so I’m drinking the whole thing myself\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not drinking the whole thing :man-facepalming:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes! Let's sort double dates!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh why were you asking me if I was free on the 10th?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: For that reason\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oooh\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So I can try and get something sorted with Toria and Dan and separately James and Alex\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We're going for food at 2.30 but I don't know when we'll finish\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Today?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Or the 10th?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 10th\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh. I’m wasn’t going to book something on a day your already doing something.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: \url{https://picoparkgame.com/en/}\\
This is the game I mentioned the other day. Could be fun or super dangerous.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We could try it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So you can see discussions now?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I can't see it in the app but if I catch it as a notification then yes\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just need to find a way for us to play it. I have a steam deck somewhere\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How are you feeling?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: pretty good. More worried about doing something and hurting myself than anything actually hurting\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well I hope you're not doing anything\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m trying to work but cannot get anywhere on this question so moving on. Plus making lunch. Barley counts as anything\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Why can't you get further with the question?\\
Still counts as something. Please take care of yourself\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just can’t get my head around the question and have to rearrange stuff. Which I am not good at.\\
I am.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Voice call, 39 sec\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: This message was deleted.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thank you for the wine.\\
Full disclosure, I don’t drink white wine. So I can either re gift or if you have other people that will drink it?\\As always it was very nice seeing you.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh sorry, I didn't realise. Yes please, let's just regift it.\\
Lovely seeing you too. Sorry it's just flying visits\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: No way you would have known. I do red wine and fizzy wine, gin, beer (very selective) and very occasional whiskey and a very specific brandy.\\
Would rather it be a flying visit after work than no visit and I’ll see you almost all day Saturday\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :smiling-face::smiling-face::smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
Hope the studying goes well\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Done for the day. Brain is mush but finished the chapter. Will get the other chapter done tomorrow and then go back. Need to check the forums as there must be a mistake.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good plan.\\
I need to go do food\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I thought you’d be making it already\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Took ages to get home. Literally got back 10mins ago\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh the silly roadworks?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't even know\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you go past Morrisons or up and over\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morrisons\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh, soo many lights\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: So tired\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Drugs tonight then?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And earlier than yesterday\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Definitely this. Just need the food and shower\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't have the spoons for either\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Both will make you feel better\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's just hard\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You shouldn’t have used up a spoon seeing me\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't be ridiculous. Why not?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Because you need to eat and shower\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But I also wanted to see you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: We’ll get showering or eating\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :star:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't like the chicken satay :pensive-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: In general or the one you made?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: This one\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Tastes weird\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: From scratch or a packet\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: In the middle. One of those from scratch packs that has it all\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well that sucks then.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Cereal?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah. I hate disappointing food\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That probably why I don’t go mad on new recipes. Don’t want to risk it being naff\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I thought it was going to be nice\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I suprised it could be that bad as it’s just chicken and peanut butter\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm thinking my tastes are fucked because I can feel a mini flare up coming\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They sometimes change depending where I'm at with fibro\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That was going to be the next question. If it was odd taste\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: As in I'll be more sensitive to stuff\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How do you try and stop the flare\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: If I'm on the way I'm on the way. I had another fatigue attack at work today\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh that’s bad\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Is it just like some unstoppable train\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Pretty much. I can try to prevent but once it starts it just depends how bad and long it will be\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you stressed yourself with the upcoming events and work stuff\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think this is more physical. I've actually been feeling quite good head wise. I just haven't had spoons for couple of weeks\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sorry I'm moaning\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not moaning just explaining how you feel.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah but I just feel like bang on about it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Anyway, what are you up to tonight?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Your not banging on about it and you don’t need to push through on things if your completely knackered.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just eating and then some games with Matt\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good, enjoy the rest :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You need to rest as well\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've grabbed some bread and Slovak frankfurters and then will go for a slow shower\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done.\\
I would make a joke about a slow shower\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: New season of Queer eye. Instantly feel better :relieved-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: nice, you've had your slow drip shower then\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You should before you get more sleepy. Then you can drug up and get to sleep\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am clean\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Maybe physically :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've left my hair curly. I don't know how I feel about it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well I like curly hair\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Will see what kind of a witch from azkaban hair I wake up with :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00007198-GIF-2024-01-25-20-36-13.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: For a second I forgot what I said and wondered what this was about :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Oh dear\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've taken drugs\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's gaming going?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done.\\
Games are ok, I am out of practice\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm sure you'll pick it up quick\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well, I wasn’t ever brilliant. Not like the guys I watch.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: As long as you're having fun\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm off to bed now. Hope your bits are doing okay.\\
Night night. Sleep well x x x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night  x x x x\\
\section*{Friday $26\textsuperscript{th}$}
Hope you sleep well.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00007210-GIF-2024-01-26-07-43-31.mp4>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Morning x x x\\
How are you this morning?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm okay. Friday tired.\\
How are you feeling? How's everything downstairs?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Longest sleep of the week\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: For you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, I was out like a light\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m ok. Tired. I’m not used to and do not like sleeping in my back.\\
Downstairs is a total mess. Kitchen needs cleaning and need to run the hover round :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\But seems ok. No pain and no more bleeding since the first day. Got to do another day of now showering so will feel discusting by tomorrow\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you find any spoons? You not being able to nap during the day seems to be a real killer.\\
Toria naps during her work day.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Do you need help with sorting stuff out?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: There is a spoon. It will have to carry me through :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thank you but I’ll be fine. The kitchen has been a lot worse. I could do stuff but deliberately doing the absolute minimum.\\
Save the spoons for something better\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: For what better?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How did the hair go?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Literally anything is better than cleaning the kitchen\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Like I’d rather sit with you on the sofa than both of us clean the kitchen\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's not about cleaning the kitchen, it's about helping you. I'm pretty sure you'd do the same\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I would and I will ask if I need any help. Just that cleaning the kitchen isn’t a priority\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okay. But I am offering even if it's not a priority. Environment has direct impact on how you feel and I want you to heal quick :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know you do and I really do appreciate it but I don’t want you burning energy you currently don’t have on stuff that can wait for me.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You still Park walking with Katie in the morning? Were you planning on coffee after?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, I'm still planning on going to PR and could pop for a coffee\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm guessing you won't be?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I won’t be doing park run but do quite fancy the coffee after.\\
Then we can start our date day and find a garden centre for lunch.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll have to go home to change but yes!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: If I wasn’t recovering I’d very much offer to help :face-with-rolling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, of course you would\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you have any thoughts of what you’d like do in between garden centre and dinner?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: A nap?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s probably a good idea.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know you don't do that so I can leave you to do your thing of you want because I will need one definitely\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, that’s all good.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Would be dangerous if we tried to nap together anyway.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not for me\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah it would. I’d be interrupting the nap\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you worked out your sleep plan for tonight?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I heard there is a nice garden centre in bourne end. Or studley green\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ve recently been to the studley green and they defo have a cafe. Bourne end is meant to be good but not been for a long time.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well “recently”. It was probably over a year ago\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm happy to drive btw\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok, that could be helpful\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We could do bourne end and if it's crap studley green\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you been doing your drugs this week. I’ve completely forgot to ask you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I have. Only missed Wednesday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What happened Wednesday\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I was out with Michelle after seeing you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And that was a normal night sleep as well. I’m guessing that will have reduced the spoon counter for yesterday.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah that's it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: If you’d have taken them late would that have broken you trying to get up?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Or did you just forget?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, if I take them past 8 I cannot function in the morning. Definitely shouldn't drive\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: We really need to get you a more sensible nap during the day friendly job.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The SSRI’s you take. Are they specifically for fibro symptoms or for depression as well?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The dose is fibro specific\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s no doubt because my mind doesn’t want to read about cosmology because it hard but I’ve been all over the place this morning with different thought.\\
You take the pill just for period pain? Any thought on experimenting with different approaches. I’m sure I’d read that the hormonal IUD has same effect but limits the hormone spread so the rest of the body is more “normal” which might help you with training and tiredness or trying out the tens machine stuff instead of any hormonal changes.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No, I take it because I don't want to have a period and I can control when I do have it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Nothing to do with period pain then?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No nothing\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hmm, ok. Stupid man question then. Wouldn’t you normally have one every 4 weeks anyway plus it happening while on holiday and special occasions.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: If I wasn't taking the pill yes\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m missing something then given that you’ve had 2 periods since we’ve been together. I’m not seeing the benefit vs the negatives.\\
As I said. Odd thoughts today.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I don't know what's going on :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I should have had min 3 by now\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: First one I was taking a break, I do that every 4-6 months. Second one was caused by stress and missing couple days of the pill\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But you don't need to worry. I'm quite well versed in my reproductive health :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have no doubt that you are and I have a very poor view on the pill. It doesn’t get better the more I see and read about hormones and the body.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Everyone is different\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And I'm not getting an IUD even if they paid me. The sheer pain levels with insertion and removal are crazy\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: They do seem painful which is a real shame given just how good and reversible the copper one is. Not that it would be any use to you.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: My issue with them is the effect on brain chemistry and depression\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I have had time when I was off the pill for a long while and honestly nothing changed for me\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How did this come up in your head?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Im not sure what started it in my head. It’s great at joining dots in a completely wrong order. I think it would have started with me thinking about how we might improve your sleep quality and then jumped around like a wasp in a box.\\
Might have no relation at all but it feels to me that the people I know who take it seem slightly more depressed than those who don’t but my sample size is very low.\\I’ve have many theory’s about many things and one of them is that one of the reasons there are a lot of single people who have a 2 year old is not only due to poor communication in that relationship but that once the mum stopped taking the pill and the body reset she is fundamentally attracted to different types of people. I’ve seen other examples of this.\\The pill absolutely destroys libido which you talked about being annoyed about and it effects progress in the gym.\\Not sure if any of that makes any sense but it was all a thought process about finding ways or a way to help you feel better. If you sleep better then everything is better and if that the helps with your training you’ll feel more better and it might boost your mood. Plus it has to be a good things to not take drugs if they are not helping.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The pill is very much helping\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think I'd have pain if I was off it. It used to be horrendous when I was in my 20s.\\
And it definitely does not affect my libido. I've been on the pill for 20 years and have been super horny through all of them\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But I do appreciate you trying to find ways to help me :smiling-face:\\
I'll get there\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s all for selfish reasons :grinning-face: the better you feel the more fun we can have.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha. You can also just say that you care about me and want me to feel better :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well obviously but that’s not the funniest way to say it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But it's nice to hear\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was implied?\\
I do care about you, a lot, so I obviously want you to feel as good as possible.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You know implied doesn't always work on me :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: True. I’m still not used to me saying nice things not being weaponised against me.\\
I’ll get better.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Get used to it :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m trying\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What are you up to after school. Are you still going to the gym?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: <attached: 00007302-AUDIO-2024-01-26-15-35-42.opus>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I am now resting. Finished the chapter. Really good one. Some of the exercises I need to look up again but the brain is a bit mush.\\
Just had small late lunch. Watching some tv then might play a game. All very relaxed.\\I phoned the clinic back re the plaster incident. All good. Just leave it all as is.\\Well done for pushing through.\\You don’t have to go mad in the gym. Half of it is just turning up. Maybe no 10 rep max weight squats.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm glad you're relaxing\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Once again 45mins to get home :face-with-rolling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Is it a fire stick remote?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Boo\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Apple tv. It has a d pad :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What's a d pad?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Arrow buttons so I don’t have to swipe.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aaaah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Warm up - treadmill\\
Single high arm row\\Each side\\10@25kg x 4\\BB squats\\10@40\\8@70 x 2\\8@75\\8@80\\BB bent over row\\10@20 x 2\\10@25 x 2\\Leg press\\10@143kg\\10@153kg x 3\\BB Bicep curls\\10@15kg x4\\with\\BB overhead press\\10@12.5kg x 4\\Stretch\\Almost cried. And everything I wanted to get on was being used. Even though the gym was quiet :face-with-rolling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Flipping heck well done.\\
That’s always the way. Even if there is only one person. They are just ahead of you on the same circuit.\\What’s the BB mean?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Plan for the rest evening? Sit, eat, cry\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Drugs\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Barbell\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's very much it + shower. Oh and I need to hoover because it's really bothering me.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How are you?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m ok. Just about to start cooking food then I think some games with Matt.\\
Should be a relatively chill evening for you then.\\What are you plans for sleeping?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's everything feeling? Do you think you'll be okay tomorrow?\\
I honestly don't know. Probably just magnesium\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Feeling ok but trying not to do much. Should be fun showering tomorrow with my pants on (it’s what they recommended)\\
We will find out tomorrow. We aren’t planning much. Coffee, Little mooch around a garden Center and dinner.\\It might all start to hurt tomorrow as that’s what some people say happens when you start moving more but only one way to find out.\\Probably a good idea re sleep. Hopefully the potato doesn’t wake you and you can get a couple more hours in.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm glad you rested.\\
It will be such a sexy shower in your colourful jockstrap :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\Well we can always go back if you're not comfy. Will you be alright driving to starbies?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh yeah, a dream shower :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Will find out driving to Starbucks. Got to now as I’ve promised  Cally a lift home. I’ve been find sat down and these jockstraps are tight. So nothing is really moving around.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh does she live local to you?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: She is in near where Matt lives, so half way between you place and mine. She has proper torn something in her leg and can barely walk. Steve (her partner) is dropping her at Starbucks and she asked for a lift back.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh poor thing! That must be so painful\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: If you can't drive I'm happy to drop you both back\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thanks. Driving should be fine. It’s not far.\\
It was a full hospital, X-ray crutches job. Cricket is very dangerous it seems.\\Not helped that she has been annoyed at her lack of progress running for months now. So this is a real knock.\\You might have a walking buddy for the winter run though.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. The offer is there.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thank you. :red-heart: very much appreciated.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I still haven't eaten :upside-down-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Why?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hoovered, did the rubbish and washed my hair. Just going to now\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Smashing the jobs. :star:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's all very hard\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: \#thatswhatshesaid\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Your the one that makes it hard\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not the thing that I meant :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well no. Doesn’t stop it being true.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How is gaming going?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not brilliant. If there is the right way and the absolute wrong way. Matt chooses the wrong way. He also cannot shoot for shot today.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m not saying I’m brilliant but it’s like he doesn’t try to be better.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahahaha\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That would be so frustrating\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It is very.\\
He deliberately doesn’t do things that would make him better and he gets annoyed that he is crap.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You getting ready for bed?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-rolling-eyes::face-with-rolling-eyes: oh Matt\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup just about to get in\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: \url{https://start.omgyes.com/join/pricing?utm-source=fiftyoff&o=50off}\\
Have you seen any of this? It’s another thing Facebook is obsessed with showing me.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll wish you good night x x x x\\
As just starting another game.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night. Look forward to seeing you tomorrow x x x\\
\section*{Saturday $27\textsuperscript{th}$}
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00007355-GIF-2024-01-27-07-31-22.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How are you feeling? Any pain? How's the bruising?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ouch\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ouch what?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Your sleep\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Only just woke up but feeling ok. I can now feel one of the bruises. It’s like an itch. Bruises are the same, which I guess is good\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Wonder how it will all feel after movement\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Enjoy your sexy shower :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, will find out today :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You park run volunteering or just going for the walk\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just walking. Feel like I need a walk\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good plan.\\
How are you feeling?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm up and not crying :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That good\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Definitely better than last night but I will 100\% need a nap later\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not suprised. It’s your worst amount of deep sleep all week, which is strange. I would have guessed a bit more.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's massively better than the 25mins I was getting last few weeks :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is bad. Means tonight’s really should be orgasms to see if that replicate the deep sleep from the week. Matches with a long sleep anyway. Might set you up for the week a little better\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well it's not like you can help me with that!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is a problem but it is also one of the test conditions. I could always be on a video call.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You're taking the research seriously :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Absolutely. It not all fun and games :grinning-face: which is why your going to have to put the work in later to see the results :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It could double your deep sleep from last night. Seems worth trying.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: To sleep for 16 hours???\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: DEEP sleep\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: As I think you did actually have twice as much deep sleep Tuesday night when compared to last night\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did I?\\
Maybe I was just overtired yesterday\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: The data does not lie. :grinning-face:\\
Maybe but that why we need to test.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Bit silly of you can be too tired to sleep properly\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: God it happens often. Especially in a flare up. Definitely don't have restful sleep. I think my body is in such survival mode that it just tries to claw back something\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Another test condition is the timing. Tuesday they were all quite early in the evening and before food\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The human body really needs a software update\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Mine definitely does\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Will Katie be joining you for coffee? I was going to aim for Starbucks for 10\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I don't know. She said she was coming for the walk but she might have things planned with the house and her kid\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I guess we will find out.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll probably be there just after 10. Shouldn't take much longer than 50mins to walk it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Great. I’m really looking forward to today\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Me too :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I just need some hugs and cuddles :smiling-face-with-open-hands:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I can definitely help with that\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know and I can't wait\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You best get ready if you’re not already and I need to start moving.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm dressed :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done. Would be a cold walk otherwise\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Breakfast?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Eaten\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Vitamins taken\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Your on a roll\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Mornings are easier. It's the evening routine I struggle with :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: More spoons in the morning\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That why your going to have to dig deep for tonight\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Definitely\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: On my way\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just finished\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How are your timings looking?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just dropped Cally.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. Will head over in 5 ish\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Voice call, 17 sec\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Home and ready for nap.\\
Sorry I'm a bit more unhinged today than usual\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s ok. Get your nap and hopefully your feel a bit more hinged\\
Thought you would have been home ages ago.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Went the wrong way :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: From where?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Never mind. Sleep first.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I went Morrisons way\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm up. God I needed this.\\
Will shower, get ready and see you soon :smiling-face:\\What have you been doing?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s good. Glad the nap helped. I’ve just been playing games.\\
Let me know when you on your way.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: What am I looking at?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: A suggestion for a day out?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh right. Yes we can do that.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: On my way\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm home\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you for a lovely evening once again :face-blowing-a-kiss:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yay, well done. I really like spending time with you and you’re very welcome for this evening.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I really like spending time with you too\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Grab some more drugs and get to bed before you lose the sleepiness. Tell the potato it’s the weekend and he doesn’t need to wake you.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm sure he'll understand that :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's the downstairs?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Took me a second :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
It’s fine, I think the main uncomfortableness is a mix of the underwear squashing everything and the hair growing.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm glad it all seems to be healing well so far.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I need to put the shopping away :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So far. Hopefully it continues. Biggest fear is doing something that then hurts for a week and then there is some nerves around “going back to normal”\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Completely get that. Just do as little as possible as long as you can. I'm here of you need anything - please don't feel like you can't ask\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is the plan. Just nothing and I don’t really have much to do for the next few days other than sitting.\\
I’m not really in a rush to abuse myself until it all feels better.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good plan\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hope you get better sleep tonight.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I forgot the frozen fruit\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :man-facepalming: so did I.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Could always get tomorrow if your desperate\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll be alright :smiling-face: thank you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I took a drug and I am in bed\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done. Night x x x x\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night. Hope you sleep well x x x\\
\section*{Sunday $28\textsuperscript{th}$}
P.S. I like you\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00007454-GIF-2024-01-28-09-01-14.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How was your sleep? Have you made it to the gym.\\
First time since Tuesday by alarm had woken me up. I might be getting better at sleeping on my back or just knackered :grinning-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How you feeling today?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've killed it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Pb'd hip thrust by a mile\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh wow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have you had breakfast yet?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not even got out of bed\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm just stretching but really fancy a mcds hash brown :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Alarm went off, messaged you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Get one on your way home\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I walk to gym\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What’s the sleep results today?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: So you don't fancy it?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Fancy what? A hash brown. Erm yes.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Certainly a lot more sleep than the rest of week\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes. I was suggesting I'll get my car after gym and pick up breakfast\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It was really fitful though. Remember waking up at least 6 times\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That explains the lack of deep then.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That was subtle but would be good :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What would you like?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Could I get a breakfast, sausage egg muffin, hash brown and latte.\\
Only assuming adding the coffee somehow makes it cheaper otherwise drop the coffee <This message was edited>\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Of course! Leaving gym in 2\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Will go home to pick up keys but won't change if that's okay :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Very much ok\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Spicy :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I best get moving then as currently very much still in bed\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Youve got about 15-20mins\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Normal or double sausage?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just normal please\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thank you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You're very welcome\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: <attached: 00007492-AUDIO-2024-01-28-09-34-03.opus>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yay, doors are open\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have to wait in the car park :disappointed-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thank you for breakfast. Really nice seeing you.\\
Good luck with jobs and school\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You're very welcome. I wanted to see you :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: \url{https://www.marksandspencer.com/c/food-to-order/valentines-dine-in}\#Menu\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ooooh\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What are you having?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Steak and chips for main was my thought but no idea for the starter or pudding.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I was thinking thermidor, rump and chips, and tiramisu :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That would work.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Do we have to get the same\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah. Each thing is for 2 people\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aaaah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm happy for you to choose different bits\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok. Will also have to see what they have.\\
We could also do it for lunch if that would be better\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah we could do a late lunch type of thing. Depending what you need to do work-wise\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just finished the test\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done :star:\\
Do you get the results of just waiting to see if you get to next stage?\\Work wise I can arrange it around when I’ll see you.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I got the results already but I still need to wait for the sift for the next stage.\\
But apparently scored better than 90\% of other applicants\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: NERD!!:face-with-monocle:\\
Well done. That’s good news\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Next Saturday so we need to sort dinner first or is dinner at the place? Cannot remember.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I don't know. I need to check with Michelle. I'll let you know as soon as.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your day going?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Days going ok.\\
Went for a hike, used the bike, jumped around. Thrown stuff in the loft. :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy: joking.\\I have sat, cleaned the kitchen and now back to sitting.\\You onto marking now?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah, you'd better not be doing any of that :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Not marking yet, just applied for another 4 jobs\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: On a roll today job wise.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm not super qualified for any of them :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But at least my 'saved civil service jobs' cue is now cleared\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Doesn’t matter. If you can do half then that’s good.\\
It’s always no if you don’t ask\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: True, true\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I was thinking...\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: When were you thinking for that coffee with your folks?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Uh oh\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh I have no idea\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah ok\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I would have said a Saturday but you are busy for the next 2\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah :disappointed-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm free Sunday 11th?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What made you think of it? Could also be done during half term\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Or a Sunday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What you doing Sunday 4th\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't know. Just because we talked about it I guess\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Scared?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Gym and work most probably\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Slightly :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The current plan is that your waking up at mine. We could hit the gym\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Cardio at home though\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahahah\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, that’s why I thought coffee outside rather than coffee \/ tea at their house or mine.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes outside might be better\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Will you be alright for cardio at home?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: In theory yes, from Wednesday, we don’t have to. Was just a joke.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It was a genuine concern\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You might have to try it out beforehand so I don't break you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: My brain doesn’t read it as a concern first time round.\\
I had thought that but you might be gentler than I would be. I did have an idea but not sure how keen you’d be to try out. I bought some flavoured condoms. My idea being oral could be the gentlest and fastest way.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's always concern\\
Rule \#2\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm up for that idea. I don't know how I feel about flavoured condoms :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: but I'll give it a go!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know rule \#2 but it is incredibly hard wired into my brain that my partner has to force themselves to want to sex things with me.\\
Working on it.\\I’d very much prefer oral without a condom but they did say the first few times might have blood. So I thought it creates options at least.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know you are. And I will keep reminding you. It just sometimes makes me feel like you don't think my intentions are good.\\
I like you, I care about you. More than you know\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yeah, let's do condoms. Not into blood play that much :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I do think your intentions are good, just a lot of very old hardwiring I’m working on. It related to you although I know it affects us both.\\
I think \/ hope if I point stuff out and your correct me it will speed it all up.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That was my thinking. Has to taste better than blood :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: There are 4 different flavours of rubber to choose\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Always point stuff out\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What flavours?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: "fun" flavours :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not mint\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah. Mint would not be a choice I’d make.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What ya doing?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Games.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Enjoy!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: They are not going well :man-facepalming:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah. With Matt?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And Seb. Seb is worse than Matt\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It should be easier with 3.\\
It isn’t\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well hope you have some kind of fun\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: We are getting there\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to have some food and then a bath\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You done marking?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Cough Always like bath pics. Cough\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Cough what if that hurts you cough\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What an erection? They don’t hurt. Slightly uncomfortable in these pants but not because of Wednesday.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aaah ok\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thought they would\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Given the amount of self abuse I need to do (doctors orders) I do need material to use.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Plus you are super hot and I like seeing you.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's a good reason\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good.\\
I will still keep on at you about how sexy I find you,\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: As you should :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Enjoy the bath. If you happen to think about what we did on Tuesday and a hand falls between your legs then tell me about it later.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: When am I seeing you this week, I’m not sure we confirmed anything.\\
Could do tomorrow at some point before your counselling session? And somewhere Wednesday or Thursday or more obviously.\\I have calls \/ meetings on Monday and Tuesday at 7pm for uni and my robot club meeting on Thursday at 8pm\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I wanted to do gym tomorrow before the session because won't be able to do Tue or Wednesday. I could pop over after work on Thursday or Wednesday after work\/laser?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Either or both for Wednesday and Thursday.\\
Have I misunderstood tomorrow then. I thought because you were coming home you had part of the afternoon off. Once the occupational health thing is done.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm supposed to be working from home. I'll see how I feel after the OH. If I can go gym after then I can pop in to see you for a bit later?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That would work. I just had it wrong in my mind that you had a few hours free in the afternoon and I certainly don’t want to stop you going to the gym or anything\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What Tuesday this week? Book club.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Seeing Agi\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll let you know when I know what's happening. What time will you be finished with uni work?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Uni work is extremely variable so I don’t have a set finish time\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You all done for the evening now?\\
Games were fun in the end.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes but we both have little routines :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah, will watch a little TV and crochet I think\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Most of my routing stuff is either early morning or evening. Middle of the day is all over the places based on the day and what is happening\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hat or are you onto the blanket?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Still Lee's hat\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Mine aren't :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So full routine all the time everytime\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: ??\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So everyday has it routine or is just the middle of your day routine\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well before we started dating yes, every day had a routine\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So I’ve ruined it all then :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh c'mon\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The routine I mean\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sometimes change is good\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well it did have to change\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We were kinda lucky that I wasn't at work in the beginning\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I did say it was going to be a little more complicated when I'm back at work\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I thought, technically, you were still at work at the start.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You did, I don’t know that it more complicated. Just less time together\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Gym two\/three times, seeing friends, seeing you, having time for myself, doing work ...\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's what I meant\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: For one date\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What are you thinking??\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Probably not what you think.\\
I was wondering how the conversation got here from trying to plan the week out and I’m still wondering what on earth this guy is making on this you tube video I’m watching.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What am I thinking?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What did you think I was thinking?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That I'm not trying to make time for you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, that was not my thought at all.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I can see you make time to see me. This morning was an example of that.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You know I get overwhelmed and I'm trying to do everything right and I've just been so full on every week since I've been back at work\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You have been full on since going back. In fairness you were fairly full on while off work.\\
As I tell everyone, work really gets in the way.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I feel like I have no time for me. But then I haven't seen some people for weeks\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m sorry. What do we need to do to solve it? Beyond a new job and a lottery win.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's not your fault :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
I just don't know how to "have it all"\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What's your feeling on pet names?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Wasn’t implying it was my fault.\\
And the solution is that you can’t. I don’t think anyone “has it all”. Even seeing friends at regular points is pretty much impossible unless you see them while doing something else shopping, gym etc.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: We are going all over the place today.\\
I don’t mind them.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well you said I'm sorry\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's my mind jumping places\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That because I care about you and don’t want you to be struggling with stuff\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I just sometimes feel like using them but I didn't know how you'd feel\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You can try some out and we’ll see what sticks. I have noticed you try a couple out\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have I?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh yeah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sometimes it's just an unconscious thing\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What have I used?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh I’m not making it that easy :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
I think you’ve used babs or some variation\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yeah :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I can really recommend reading that book I gave you. I found it very helpful in refining what is important and trying to answer the question “What do you want to do?” Any interpretation is valid and I’m not expecting an answer\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Whenever I have the time :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's hard because my friends are my family, my support network etc so I really don't want to sacrifice time with them. And spending time with you is really important for me too. And spending time with myself I'd really necessary and important too.\\
Just need more days in the week :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It would help a huge amount if you didn’t have to spend a lot of Sunday working and then get up early in the week.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh it would. I would have loved to spend the morning with you today\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I do think a lot of things will get better for you once your job is the normal 9-5 style\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think so too. But don't want to put everything else on hold until then. I've been doing that for too long\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No, you can’t put stuff on hold.\\
Just the constant battle of trying to balance things.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah :pensive-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did something happen this afternoon? Feels like you might of fallen off an emotional cliff a bit.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Fallen off an emotional cliff? :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to take that as a genuine concern\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yes\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nothing happened but I've mentioned that I have been a bit teary since Friday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you! I missed that.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Any reason or just the fun part of being a women.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The fun part of fibro\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How are you coping with all of my extra bits? The fibro, etc etc?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What the etc etc stuff?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Low moods, overwhelmed, etc etc\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Pain moans\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm guessing you didn't imagine all the bits when you were wanting to ask me out\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I didn’t but then you never really know what going on with people until you start getting to know them.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And now?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Erm, this is is somewhat expected. I know you’re not meant to admit this but I have dated women before.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: If I had the choice or ability I’d choose that you don’t have fibro but as I’m just not that good it just something we deal with.\\
I’m still learning and want to do what I can to help you feel better.\\I really like you.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think you have mildly mentioned it twice, I nearly broke you at least once when we were having sex but I think 2 times.\\
I’m certainly not used to you saying pain response noises when I touch you and you being ok with it. So, sometimes else for me to retrain my brain against.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Alas, neither of us has that ability. I'd much rather not have it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I meant more of me moaning that I'm in pain.\\
Yeah. I do appreciate you checking on me when it comes out. Obviously I don't want you to be afraid to touch me.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you read my response. I don’t really have memories of you moaning that you’re in pain.\\
I’m not afraid to touch you, I want to do it soo much and more than I do already.\\Part of the hardwired thing from earlier is that I do have a fear of you rejecting me touching you.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I did read it!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It just read specific to mine saying that it hurt when you squeezed me yesterday\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And good that you're not afraid to touch me :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm not going to reject you touching me\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, I just want to make sure that it feels good when I touch you.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Like when I was rubbing you legs on Tuesday\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That was nice\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: My mind has jumped. Do we need to get one of those nail yoga mat things\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to get one\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Shakti mat\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s the stuff\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm watching Queer eye and crying :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Cathartic?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's just so lovely\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have you ever watched it?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No, not really my thing\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Maybe I could persuade you when I do a rewatch :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’d give it a try\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How are you feeling? Head wise?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: In general?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't mean the downstairs, but that too?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m ok. I keep annoying myself with some of my mini spirals but that’s a general thing not a today thing.\\
I had the thought earlier when we were talking about Valentine’s Day that by the time we get there I should know something about my PhD stuff and that was a bit scary.\\Was trying to plan out the week as a new uni module starts this week so I’ve just got to be better at spending the right time studying.\\A little nervous about how the next 6 weeks will go training wise as that will all change while Hannah takes time off. I know it will be fine but it’s a change. Hopefully I can shift some weight at least.\\Downstairs is fine. I do not like sleeping on my back but I’m not making my shoulder hurt so maybe it’s good. No doubt I still snore. The bruising seems to be going down and I’ve started poking at it all a bit and all seems quite normal. But worried about how I’m going to get the plaster off but will worry about that in the shower tomorrow and just want to get back to normal as soon as I can.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What kind of mini spirals? Can I help with them?\\
The PhD stuff is scary. But you have done everything you could so we just need to hope for a positive outcome.\\We can do gym together while Hannah is away if you want?\\Good that the bruising is going down. But hopefully you're not poking it too much.\\The plaster will come off in the shower. Or I have some coconut oil that would help with that too\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just the normal spirals and you’re already helping and I think I’m making slow progress. They are all around not being good enough, smart enough etc. a lot of imposter syndrome type stuff.\\
I’ve nearly worked something out. I am extremely good at picking up negative comments even if I know they are meant as a joke. I then amplify them 10x and just delete any positive comments.\\I just then burn time sorting it all out in my mind.\\The PhD will be what it will be. I don’t really want to think about it but I don’t know if I have the energy to try again for another year and hope but I also don’t want to keep always wondering.\\Yes to the gym, would be nice to do at least the Sunday session or something together. That might also be because I really like the idea of spending time with you in bed in the morning.\\No im not poking too much. Might take you up on the coconut oil. Will see tomorrow.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okay I'm glad I'm helping but please just vocalise them so I can help more if possible\\
Yeah I used to do that too. Tends to come hand in hand when you're not feeling great about yourself. As silly as it night sound to you, affirmations do help rewire the brain.\\Did I say something?\\We can deal with that when the decision comes.\\We can do a Sunday. But you know I go early :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\Let me know and I can bring it with me\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I can give you a recent example of a mini spiral but I already know you’ll give me the eye roll emoji, which is why I didn’t talk to you about it but it did have my brain arguing with itself for over an hour.\\
You were reading the paperwork from the vasectomy and we got to the test stuff. Basically once it’s healed I’ve pretty much got to cum 4 times a week to really give everything the best chance of working. Which are pretty high number I certainly won’t have done since being much younger if ever.\\We were joking about it and I don’t remember the exact wording but you joked (pretty sure it was meant as a joke) that I’m going to have to sort myself out because you are tired.\\Brain went full spiral :cyclone: that of course I need to do it myself, I’m disgusting, it’s not like people look across a room and think about sleeping with me etc, maybe I should look again at getting drugs.\\I knew it was a joke but I had an argument with myself for a little while about the whole thing.\\There was the cake comment yesterday about a birthday cake. Where I thought I’d fucked up. Which I guess I did.\\The spa picture made me think I’d forgotten to do something.\\I think what I’m working out is that the more I care about someone the more I think I keep messing stuff up and I’m really trying quite hard not to mess up. So it’s almost a double failure in my brain.\\How early on a Sunday? Like no time for snuggles or snuggles once we get back and shower. I used to do a 7:45 spin class on a Sunday. H\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Drugs!!! Way too late.\\
Isn’t it bed time for you?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh sweets. Yes it was definitely a joke (and I don't know if I can go 4 times a week either :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:)\\
Maybe it is a good idea to talk to someone about this. You can't be this horrible to yourself.\\Do you think I'd be with you if I was thinking even one of those things?\\I've told you I haven't had good birthdays previously so I did think you might do something like a cupcake or something. But in grand scheme of things I guess it doesn't matter. And I didn't expect an abrupt response to the spa picture as I only sent it as a cute suggestion :woman-shrugging-light-skin-tone:\\I get what you mean but please don't make it a self fulfilling prophecy. If you fixate on messing stuff up you can't enjoy what we have\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Way too late for drugs reminder but I've taken them :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
It's bedtime. I'm snuggled in\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s what ends up killing the spiral is that if my crazy thoughts were true we wouldn’t be together. I’d just like my brain to be faster at getting there. It is a lot faster than it used to be but either more fast or just don’t start with it at all.\\
Well it’s me that has to get to 4 not you :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: although it’s seems very much a quantity not quantity requirement.\\I was and am very annoyed at myself about the cake thing. I thought \/ remembered it while I was away and then it completely skipped my mind.\\I’m very aware to not becoming a self fulfilling prophecy.\\I just want to try and make you happy.\\Night x x x.\\Have you gone for melatonin again?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Exactly. Tell the brain to shush with that!\\
Ah the cake is what it is. No point dwelling on it now .\\You do make me happy and I really like you. Like really.\\No, just magnesium tonight\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope you sleep well.\\

Night x x x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00007713-GIF-2024-01-29-08-25-47.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Weird sleep and woke up in the middle of the night with a headache so had to get up for meds.\\
How are you?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: A lot of REM and that crap that you had to get up for headache pills. Maybe nerves about the OH?\\
I’m ok, just started moving around. Should have booked my shopping an hour earlier but never mind. Hopefully it arrives early in the delivery hour.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I had that headache on and off all day and can still feel it.\\
At least it's just one period\\Such an exciting morning for you :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: what's your plan for today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Are you drinking enough water  :grinning-face:\\
Super exciting as always.\\Plan for the day is breakfast, shopping, shower, work, batch cook at lunch for the week then  more work. Maybe see you depending on things, got a lecture thingy at 7 and some games.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, of course I am. By the time I left the gym yesterday I drank 1.5 litres.\\
I think I'll be able to come see you later\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sounds good. Enjoy the class.\\
Maybe you’ll get a nap in today as well?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah not sure. The appointment is going to be long and if I want gym and to see you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I did wonder that. How long should the appointment be?\\
Are you done for the day now?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: About hour - hour and half.\\
I'm just about to leave :smiling-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Nice, hopefully a quick drive home for you then. When’s the appointment?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Drive was nice. But half the lights are out on handy cross :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
11.30\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have you had your shopping yet?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Always something broken.\\
Yep shopping arrived and your outfit has just arrived as well.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oooooh exciting!\\
How does it feel to the touch?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: VERY soft\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Omg I can't wait :smiling-face-with-heart-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you :face-blowing-a-kiss:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I will want to see in person and picture\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha of course!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hope your OH goes well.\\
If that’s a thing.\\Should I get this for the weekend?\\Brentfords Weighted Blanket 8kg for Adults Therapy Anti Anxiety Autism Insomnia Stress Relief, King Size - Silver Grey - 150 x 200cm \url{https://amzn.eu/d/8NqVNvS}\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just finished. It was a lot.\\
Don't worry, I can bring mine with :smiling-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I have a raging headache and just realised I trained three days in a row so will need a rest day today. Could come for a cup of tea earlier\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Was it good though?\\
Cup of tea would be nice.\\Does that mean you now have time for a nap?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What time do you want me to come?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What works best for you. I’m currently banging my head against a book. As I said I’m pretty flexible on timings\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s always annoying when you cannot get the calculation in the book to match the answer in the book :man-facepalming:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I could come now for a bit and then can have a nap\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That works for me\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. Give me 15-20mins\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :red-heart:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did not know it pulses when used on its own\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It does\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :red-heart:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You didn't graduate the ou? 2004 is your Ba isn't it?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also just we know. I was joking about the donut. I'm glad you enjoyed it :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Exactly! 2004 was the Bsc\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll have to give the standard explanation of what I’m trying to do as I reply.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm sure you can explain it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s just if they read it and can move past there checklist. Will know soon enough.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are we okay with this?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yes\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Omg I forgot my cosies\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m even looking at them. Did you want to come and pick them up on way back from the shop\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Can I pick them up on Wednesday?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And I'll have them ready to model on Saturday :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep, they will be in the same place :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Amazing\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Its march 16-17 i'm away roboting\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okie doke. Where are you guys off to?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, I didn’t check that. It’s north east of the M25. 2 hours away ish.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you napped?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nope :pensive-face: bit I've eaten\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, I'd already be obsessively researching\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Someone has already sent a link to the travel lodge we should use so I’ll just use that. I have seen on a map in one of our past meetings.\\
Early night for you tonight then.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Given it’s just me and I need a hotel that is there. I don’t worry about it too much. If other were going then I’d worry a bit more.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What will you guys be doing there?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And Travelodge is a decent one anyway\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I believe the first day is seminars on different things. That where I’ll be giving my “beginners” talk. I think the theme is sensors.\\
Then the second day is competition\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh is it like a conference?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, one of the twice yearly ones\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Full nerd\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah alright! I didn't realise. I thought you were just doing a robot weekend :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: My nerd though\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m not sure I can work out what you thought a robot weekend would be\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha me neither\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did you take the compliment?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00007784-GIF-2024-01-29-16-15-05.mp4>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: This one? I did.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm just checking. Never know if I made you flutter or uncomfortable\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That one didn’t\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Didn't what?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Didn’t make me feel uncomfortable\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Small steps\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep, any step forward is progress.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How’s the headache?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It is :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Took some meds so went down\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Somewhat simple then.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Somewhat :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, were we doing dinner on Wednesday or were you just dropping by?\\
I thought you were dropping by but then I thought about the timings of it all given it’s a late day for you on Wednesdays\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I was just thinking about dropping by? I'm going to be yukky from a day at work\\
But don't want to keep you from eating\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s what I thought was happening. Just wanted to check. You won’t keep me from eating.\\
I could whip up something as long as I know before end of tomorrow but I know you’ll want to reset \/ decompress.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, but I also like time with you. Just don't want to look like goblin :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You don’t look like a goblin. :man-facepalming:\\
You could shower here if you like. It’s part broken but still better than what’s yours sounds like,\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I could! You're not doing laundry soon by any chance?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Laundry for what?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Cosies :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I would wash those separate anyway. I can wash if you like.\\
Maybe we should have checked they fit\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: And I have clean towels etc\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah crap, yes\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know that!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I was purely thinking of the cosies\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Let’s check that on Wednesday, the fit at least.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. I'll pack cosies\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well leggins\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Does that means your having dinner at mine now?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I can if you want\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Risk the beef (I’d cook it on Wednesday) or something else?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I thought you were making it today?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I was but time got away from me so I changed it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll try a little\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sorted the PhD email instead and if I’d have rushed cooking it wouldn’t be ready before my tutorial.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Fair enough. Heard anything back?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I can make something else\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not yet\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No don't worry. Do your meal prep\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Then what will you eat?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The beef\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Salmon scrambled eggs\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Tuna and stir fry veg\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll have the beef\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just a little portion\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok. I’ll cook that on Wednesday the .\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm trying a little cat nap\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good luck. Set an alarm.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I did\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am all therapied out :woozy-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done for doing it.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Tears this week?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No. This is just anxiety focused\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: At least you can relax now.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you had dinner or was lunch very late\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Lunch was very late so not really hungry\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have you had yours?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, like to eat before the tutorials. So I done get hangry and then eat late\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's a good way\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm so cold\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Emotional drained?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Blast the heating\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I want to tweak my LinkedIn but will wash my hair and then see\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Completely today\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: As I reason for being cold\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Most probably\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Heated blanket\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I will get one\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :eyes::eyes::eyes::eyes::eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Was that the stuff we looked at the other day? Did you add anything\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Maybe\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :eyes::eyes::eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I guess you'll have to wait and find out\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :woman-shrugging-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: A guess I will.\\
Feel like it’s going to help get my numbers up even more.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's not going to be here by Wednesday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Probably a safe thing for me\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Probably\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't let me buy anymore stuff :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I see what you’ve  bought first :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I hope at least one thing fits\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Will know soon enough.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s all very exciting\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I thought it'd would perk you up <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You’re pretty damn good at getting me perked up already.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm glad\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope the tutorial is good\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Me too. Just joined. The last chapter was very interesting so hopefully this reinforces it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: you going with drugs tonight?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm not sure. Still have the headache :weary-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was tutorial?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Tutorial was ok. Covered the chapter nicely but nothing revolutionary.\\
That’s sucks about the headache. Maybe linked to the emotions of the day?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've had it since Saturday\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Gad you enjoyed the tutorial :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not good\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah not ideal\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've popped the drug and will head to bed soon.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did you get up to much post tutorial?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just playing some games. Going better today. Already won twice which is suspicious.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah well done\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night. Hope you sleep well x x x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night x x x\\

\section*{Tuesday $30\textsuperscript{th}$}
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x\\
How did you sleep? Everything feeling better downstairs?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Took ages to get to sleep. Silly back sleeping but then was ok.\\
In fairness downstairs has felt ok the whole time but it definitely feeling “more normal” if that’s a thing. So that’s good.\\What was you sleep like?\\How’s the head?\\Hope you have a good day.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Had a hard time getting up but at least the headache seems to have gone down.\\
What's your plan for today?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I replied to Michael this morning and apparently his colleague is interviewing for a role that would be a good match and wanted to have a look at my LinkedIn. Will need to send him CV when I get home\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Lots of rem the last 2 days and a good amount of sleep. Deep is still low but at least you’re still getting plus 7 hours total.\\
Just work today and a tutorial again later and some more games but need to go hard on the work today.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s encouraging news from Michael. He is super nice and gave me some good advice about the PhD.\\
Do you have to wait until  you get home or can you send at lunch?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, definitely more rem recently. Now just to get some deep sleep and I'm golden.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't have the latest version of it anywhere on the cloud so will have to wait until I'm home\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Doh, do you have 2 laptops then?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well I have my own at home. and school computers here\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And the school ones are monitored so I'm not putting anything private through them\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That make sense but i rarely see people who have their own computer and work computer.\\
I agree. Not having person stuff on my work machine or at least only on my work machine.\\Oh, I should show you the backup software I use. Very fire and forget. Good for piece of mind and a super sexy topic.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well all teachers tend to as we have to plan at home\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yeah, please do show me\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just a reminder that I really like you, think you’re really pretty and both emotionally and physically strong.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Needed that. Thank you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I really like you too, you know\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Fingers crossed!\\
Debbie is a real talker\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: :crossed-fingers: given the gibberish she sent when asking about it I’m hoping this response at least mean I’ve done through to be considered.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's work going?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Cried twice and yelled WTF 9 times.\\
So, pretty good :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\Chapter done. Going to have lunch then go back through and pull out the formulas etc.\\might post in the forum as if we get an exercise in the exam I’m fucked. Also want to get some assignments questions done.\\How are you?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Why have you cried?\\
Sounds like a busy morning for you.\\I have the littles all day today so already exhausted\\But I found the CV I sent to softcat so sent it off to Mike\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: The crying was a joke but I felt like it. Was just one of many moments while studying that I felt super stupid.\\
Oh that’s good about the cv. Hopefully that turns into something.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Really hoping. He said it might be too late for this one as they are interviewing this week but his colleague wanted to have a look at my CV :woman-shrugging-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :crossed-fingers:you never know. Might just mean a last minute phone interview \/ you having a very important unmovable doctors appointment\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Literally everyone at work is talking about next year this, next year that and like I am the absolute lynchpin that will hold everything together ( I mean I am, considering I'm the only one teaching both to GCSE) and it's making me feel so guilty I'm being all sneay\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: This is just the way it is and you have nothing to feel guilty about.\\
Guilt and enough money are what keep people in work that they shouldn’t.\\You can’t tell anyone you’re looking for a job. Just the reality of work. They will find out when you resign.\\What’s the alternative? Be super tired and both physically and mentally ill while not achieving or pursuing any personal goals in a job that will replace you once you leave. OR get a new job that you can hopefully enjoy that also allows you to live a life not centred around a few weeks off each year.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know you're right. You know how it is, when it's good you forget a little about the bad\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The brain is great at that plus is doubles down when you know your leaving. You only see more good. Jobs, relationships etc. the brain hates change even if you know change is good.\\
Remember\\“What if turns out better than you imagine”\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What if it does!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Was that meant to be doesn’t?\\
Generally things do turn out better than expected.\\Guess what happens if it isn’t as good as you expect? Make a change and move forward <This message was edited>\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think everything I’ve been scared of doing has turned out better than I thought it would\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No no, it was meant to say does! I was just seconding what you said\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh good\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m pretty confident that most decisions in life can be undone or changed if you don’t like them.\\
The only ones that are pretty impossible to change are to do with relationships and children.\\Children cannot be undone and while you can end relationships I’m not sure you can go back. Not that I’ve ever wanted to.\\So really it’s just the kids one.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah you can't return kids to sender :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: nice\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's a gooooooood role\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: send over the description when you have it. Want to be nosey\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've sent it to you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: seen it. Looks like what you are looking for\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's a massive paycut but I'm still going to send stuff in\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Maybe just for practice. Maybe they will be able to negotiate\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: exactly\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just got home. Will have some food and then get on the job app\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done. What time are you meeting Agi?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I went straight from work\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well planned.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: If I don't do something straight after work then there's slight chance I do it after I get home :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was your afternoon?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Rough. Spent most of my time banging my head against the wall trying to work stuff out and getting more and more annoyed that I cannot work it out. Just burning time I don’t have not getting it.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What can be done to help you? Forums? YouTube?\\
I'm guessing you've tried all of those\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Tried those. The issue is more of time. I was just about on track to catch up and I know I’m missing something stupid rather than something fundamental\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You can still catch up\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't give up!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I might because the work doesn’t even count and I’ve already burnt more hours than I’d planned on it.\\
Just very frustrating\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know it is. But you can do it! It's got to count somewhere and you're good at solving problems\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I might have made some progress :man-facepalming:. It I very annoying that I have to walk away for so long to be able to fix stuff.\\
How's your job stuff going\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm just about to start\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Could I send it to you later?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: of course\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Feeling really nervous all of a sudden\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: dont really have anything good to say to that. You just do what you can and see what happens\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll try\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: in other news, I might have a fully functioning shower for you tomorrow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Wooo hooo\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've sent you both CV and cover letter\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: has your CV changed from last time\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've tweaked it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: never mind\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: read the email\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Cover letter is excellent :star:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Super picky comment about the CV. You have "I love" back to back in your hobbies section. otherwise brilliant\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I didn't even realise\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i'd send it and then you can sit down\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki will do\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Fluttery tummy :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :face-with-tears-of-joy: it will be what it will be\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Shall I send them as PDFs?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: it have just sent as word but maybe a PDF is better\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: send as PDF\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: no problem\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: much easier reading a cover letter and cv than writing ohne\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah yes\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But knocked this one out in an hour. I'm getting better\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: yeah, well done. They get faster. Just end up with little tweaks about the role and company. bulk stays the same\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: now you can relax for an hour and pack for tomorrow. You coming straight from school to mine?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh good reminder about packing :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Yes, I should be at yours just before 6\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: What will happen for the potatoes food?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ooooh shit. My brain is mush. I'll have to go home and feed him. Might as well shower here then\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Still pack. You can still shower at mine. That way you won’t get cold going from shower to my place\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okay\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Saves taking the clothes off twice :winking-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Really only need a wash and cosies\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I guarantee my shower is currently nicer than yours\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I believe you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: All snuggled in bed. Hope the games went well tonight\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: They are going.\\
Night x x x x\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night x x x\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'd get my leg stuck in those ropes :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So either funny or sexy. I’d take it.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh jeezus\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hope you have a good day and hoping you hear something good about that job.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you! Hope you do too. What's your plan?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Got to get out of bed :man-facepalming: the not falling asleep so easy has really shifted bed time and waking up.\\
Got some house jobs to do and the never ending uni work.\\Diner needs several hours in the oven so will cook that just after lunch.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sleep schedule gets so messed up if the routine is interrupted\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Shambolic is the right word. No drugs for last night?\\
Good duration and REM.\\Were you tossing a lot?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Magnesium only.\\
I think so. I did wake up couple of times to adjust myself. I have been in quite a bit of pain since yesterday\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Localised pain or all body?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: All body\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Can I do anything?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I appreciate the offer but unfortunately no :face-blowing-a-kiss:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: For dinner later I can do you some stir fry veg as well if you like? It is zero extra effort for me to do.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Don’t forget to bring drugs with you later or take them before hand.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That would be nice thank you. Just no peppers please\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Erm, I’ll see what’s in the bag :grinning-face:. It’s a premix.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha okay\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your day going?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: slow, just noticed the time. Still think I have this silly assignment question wrong but never mind. Had to do some life admin that got no where. Going to have quick lunch finish this question and then get some house work done\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: how about you?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: looking forward to seeing you later\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We all have days like that sometimes\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Non stop. And really don't want to stay for the twilight but have to\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Me too :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: A feeling I find myself having more often than I would like. Having real bad time blindness this year. Hopefully it will settle once the routine kicks back in.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: don't go nuts. Can just keep it very calm tonight.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Exciting\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They tried calling twice and I was like why is someone from Berlin calling me :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, I wouldn’t have expected the can  from Germany either\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You have brunch on the 10th. Were you busy on the 9th?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What's happening on the 9th?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Either we are seeing each other or I might be doing something else\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What are you doing?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We can meet on Sunday and you do your thing on Fri?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Might be meeting my useless friend Chris if we weren’t going anything\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Go and have fun. We can spend the day together on Sunday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok sounds good. Actually now having dinner with Becky Friday and I can see Chris on Thursday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good luck with the call.\\
You got this.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: <attached: 00008052-AUDIO-2024-01-31-17-14-07.opus>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sound good with the call. See you in a bit. Safe travels.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I just got home. So much traffic. Will let you know when I'm leaving\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yay\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just leaving\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Home!\\
Thank you again for the shower and the dinner. It was yum even if my tummy is weird :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You’re very welcome. Not idea why it makes your tummy weird although mine does make noises from it.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh who knows. But it's still really yum\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: If we risk it again I’ll make sure to get bread. Maybe that will help or hinder.\\
Good luck with your call tomorrow. I hope it’s in the morning so you can get it out to the way and move onto the next steps.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I do too. Really nervous even though it's probably like an informal chat and what not\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That should be all it is.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Btw, when you're ready to talk about the whole happy thing, I'm here\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thank you. To say you caught me off guard would be an understatement and I’m sorry I upset you. That was not my intention.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I didn't realise it was going to be a problematic question\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ive pottered around and am now in bed\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: pottering.\\
Have you taken any melatonin or just going normal?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have taken melatonin. Feel like I could sleep for a week\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hope you sleep well.\\
Night x x x\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you. Night night x x x\\

\section*{Thursday $01\textsuperscript{st}$}
P.S. I like you\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I like you x x x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00008072-GIF-2024-02-01-07-55-47.mp4>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How are you feeling this morning?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just had the call\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Whoop. How’d it go\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Super positive. Apparently perfect role for me. Keen to get me to an interview so either today after school or tomorrow morning\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00008077-GIF-2024-02-01-08-01-18.mp4>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s great news\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Virtual interview I’m guessing?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Asked me salary expectations. I said what I was on but that I was willing to drop to 45-47k. First she was like that's quite a lot more (40k offer) but she can say that they would give me the range\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: All very exciting\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh my goooooood\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :grinning-face: this is good. This is the bit that moves fast\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: So fast\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: But you might know things by end of tomorrow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll have to do the interview in the car again tomorrow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They said probs Monday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So interview is defo tomorrow morning then?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: At least you won’t have to wait very long. Unlike all the other stuff.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well I gave options of after 4.30 today, tomorrow 8am or tomorrow after work\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: From the sounds of it. The interview would be a formality to expand on today’s call. As you said they are in a rush.\\
Then you could get the offer letter Monday.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The interview is with the UK recruiter\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes she said they want it as soon as because they want to let the others know\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Very exciting and always a good sign if they have people they’ve already interviewed but want to talk to you more.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Do you have a preference on the interview?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What do you mean?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Time\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not sure. Probably tomorrow morning\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: My guess will be that’s the one they go for. No one wants to do anything end of Friday and today might be a bit short notice for the other people.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How was your sleep?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Wow\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You must have just crashed\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I did\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How did you sleep?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok, not super long.\\
I do not like that my sleep has shifted. Need to try for earlier tonight as I’m up early tomorrow anyway.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sleep always shifts when routine gets buggered.\\
What's your plan for today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Seeing my parents this morning and this weeks cosmology work. Got my robot club call later. The  tomorrow I can start on my new module.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aw that's lovely. Are you doing anything with them?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just going round for a drink and chat. Will play with the dog a bit.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sounds lush :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ive gotten really unwell so I'm just on my way home\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh no, let me know when you get home.\\
What can I do?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just home. They've installed the new locks and I couldn't get into the building so had to go find the tradies and get a key\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m assuming you got in now? Does that mean they can get your work done in your flat dinner then?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I did get in. Well I mentioned that I was booked in at 5 but apparently they finish work at 3.30 and don't even have the wiring with them today. He's going to come round at some point but that means I can't even go rest :loudly-crying-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Brilliant so they cannot even finish the work :man-facepalming:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly just\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I just wanted to curl up and sleep. Barely drove back\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Do you want to rest at mine? I could pick you up.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No because they have to come sort stuff out so have to wait for them and need the rest of the keys too\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh, I could do some study on your sofa while you sleep?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What wrong, did you have a fatigue attack?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 2. And left side of my face is going numb again\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Again? That sucks.\\
Could be the job stress?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Coupled with a definite flare up\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to try some food and see\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was it at parentals?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Still here. Just about to leave\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Had a nice time?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah nice to see them both. Just a long time.\\
Good plan on the food.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Take it you’ll take tomorrow off work?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm not sure yet\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But I do have the interview at 8am\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think you know what my suggestion would be plus rule \#1\\
That’s great about the interview.\\Rest as best you can today. Get the interview over and done first thing and rest the rest of Friday.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know... But you also know what goes on inside my head in regards to taking time off\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know and maybe you need to see how you feel tomorrow but isn’t it the harder you try and push on the longer and worse everything else gets?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It is, it is!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So, big picture stuff and logic etc.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know you're right\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Your going to get bored of saying that :grinning-face:\\
Isn’t it also easier to sort cover for tomorrow today than scrambling in the morning when you’ll need to focus on the interview\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Friday is but one day.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And a long weekend could reset me\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I was already there on that. Meaning you’re not completely ruined all of next week. Dragging yourself through it which then ruins your actual week off for half term.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, all of that\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know you don’t like disappointing people. No one does and you no doubt still have some guilt (which you don’t need to carry) for the time off last year. That doesn’t mean you owe anything. That’s past.\\
This is your future both short and long term. In a week \/ months time one day off work will not matter to anyone but if you force stuff and break yourself for you week off you will be annoyed at yourself and then be waiting for Easter before you can do stuff.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Stop being right :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Get used to it. It was my job for 20 years. Logic and scenario planning.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Brilliant. You have soo got this.\\
Even my mum says so.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-rolling-eyes::face-with-rolling-eyes::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha. Does she?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What else is she saying?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Mainly because she liked the story. Chatting to someone from the running club Saturday. Job interview by Friday on a job they have already held interviews for. Means you’re recommended and on paper better than anyone they have already spoken to.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aw tell her thanks\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I do wonder about that competency question\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So, new plan then.\\
Rest, sort cover, get door done or workmen leave, more rest.\\Tomorrow, nail interview, rest or gym or anything as day to yourself to help reset, fun theatre evening. Boom. Weekend to relax.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: No idea either. Just go through it when they ask. “I don’t know” is a perfect response as long as it is followed up with the steps you’d take to find out the answer and what expectation management would be done.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Is it going to be like 'tell me a time when you..'?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Probably\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well hopefully Amanda is nice\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m sure she will be. Recruitment people generally are.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I spoke to the door people. There's a different engineer coming at 5 so will try to get some rest before that\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sounds typically well organised or maybe deliberate so that people are home.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No I had it specifically booked in for 5. Just the guys that are here said they finish at 3.30\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also, just replied to the interview email and Amanda is actually out of office at the moment so if she's taking the time specifically to speak to me, that's massive\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Given what you’ve said it looks like they are. All very encouraging. Which no doubt you’re converting into stress \/ guilt.\\
This is all good.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not the converting bit but you get what I mean\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How did you know :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Try at least to relax. The job interview is exciting. Best case you get a job which you want and will be a new exciting chapter where you might even have energy in the week to do things. Or it’s good practice.\\
Basically all a win.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Wonder what would happen if you talked to yourself the same lovely, supportive way :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Don’t turn this around :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just a thought\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I had the same thought. Probably good things. Sometimes I can do it, just not if my brain is in a spiral or bad mood. Much easier for me to do it to others. (Sounds wrong)\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think there is a technical reason why it’s easier to be supportive to others vs yourself.\\
Something around you knowing everything about yourself but only knowing about other people what you have seen and heard.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I get it. I used to be very mean to myself. You have to retrain your brain. If you wouldn't say it to a friend or even a stranger you should not say it to yourself\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: As I said. I used to be horrific. I am soo much better now but still have moments.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah you do :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They have been drilling for well over an hour, I still haven't rested\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: urgh, i'm sorry. Nothing drowns out that drilling noise. They are not done by 3:30 then :man-facepalming:\\
Have you just been pottering and stewing then\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I have.\\
They are actually installing the intercom at mine now but uuuggrrrrhhhh\\I'll definitely need to take the day tomorrow at this rate\\How's work been?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That's something at least.\\
I thought I had logically proven multiple times that you need to take tomorrow anyway.\\Slow, going to go back and catch up on the stuff I missed before I start a fresh chapter\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You have but I needed my own evidence :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: what evidence do you need and what happens if you force yourself to go to school tomorrow and it messes up your weekend or is the start of it messing up your week off?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just my conclusion :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: rule \#1\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know I know\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: if I flip the thought process. If I, as a manager, sent someone home from work mid day for being unwell. There is logically no way they are working tomorrow.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know. I don't think they are expecting me to be honest\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: then its a nice quick email to confirm plus what I assume is a stupid amount of extra bollox to send over. Then the day is clear and you dont have to lose sleep over worrying about your interview AND telling work your not coming in.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I will do that later. They've just left so going to try get at least half hour nap\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Work's sorted. Don't even need to send cover in\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :star: Result. Well done.\\
Just the interview and then you get back the day to yourself that the door installed took away today\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I will get that rest and then have a look at some company stuff I guess. Any pointers on what to look at?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just see if you can find out what the company does and write down what questions you have about the role, the team you'd be working with, etc\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Id always be interesting in the specifics of the team and the work the team is doing. What there goals are, how long people have been there.\\
Some basic HR questions. How much annual leave do you get, are there rules around booking it are there ways to get more. What sort of incentives does the company offer beyond salary. Some places have discount schemes, holiday buy back (at EY I could buy more holiday although this was just pre paying for unpaid leave).\\Make sure to end the interview with some sort of "Been great talking to you, what are the next steps and when will I hear from you?)\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Pick and choose from here\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You're the best :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have my moments.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Are you going to be at home Monday 4-4:30?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: More like 4.30. won't leave work until 3.30 and will take me about 45mins\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Will can look at the flat then. I can be there as well if you like?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh brilliant! Thank you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Is that a yes to both?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes please\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sorted\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Plus I’ll get to see you. So double nice\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Really appreciate you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thank you.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: For what?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: being nice\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm always nice (mostly):face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You left soap here btw.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just in case I'm taking other showers again. Hope that's ok\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah that’s ok.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was your afternoon?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not sure what happened to it :face-with-tears-of-joy:. Got some stuff done at least. Just about to cook dinner.\\
How are you feeling now?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: At least you got it done :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
What are you making?\\I'm feeling real shit to be honest\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: :crying-face:\\
Just cooking rice to go with the beef from yesterday.\\Is it like yesterday’s all over pain or different?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yum. I'm having cereal :grinning-face-with-sweat:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's that and more\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: A lot of pain, a lot. Really dizzy and nauseous, wobbly\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you been like it before?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: A variation, yes\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Dizzy is just horrible. Try  it to fall over.\\
Do you think you could just eat, drugs and try to sleep?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not to fall that should have said\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to eat, had some drugs and will try to do some interview prep\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Can you do that lying down in bed or does lying down make it worse\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No lying down for me at the moment\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I mean it is hard to eat cereal lying down.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I need to write stuff down to prep\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You’ll have to get spud to get you thinks while you sit.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: He's useless at that\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Cats :man-facepalming:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Animals with non opposable thumbs\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Pets always know. He does seem suspicious of the camera.\\
Are you sat at your desk\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: yeah, im going through some questions\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Any questions about your questions?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Something I ordered from the bedroom has arrived.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh what is that?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: not yet, chat gtp is helping :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s good. Hope you’re not spiralling about it.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Lamp, for sunset lighting. It might have seen something on instagram.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that's cool\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No just asked it to give me some competency questions based in the key responsibilities and just popping some examples down\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: When is your robot club call?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: 8\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Looking forward to it?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: they are always interesting. Tonights topic just jump out as being super relevant to what I'm trying to do but we will see. Tonight is about line sensing. I need to see if they publish the video for the last one as I had to miss that and that was on a topic I liked.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I love how super organised the club is\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I am also meeting Duncan next week so really need to try and make some progress on my current stuff so I have something to talk about\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think its like a swan on the river. Looks calm but its kicking it legs like crazy underneath\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You'll have to show me your robot at some point\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: sure, if you think you can keep you pants on long enough.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahahah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I find it sexy when people are excited about their hobbies\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: then I refer you to my previous message\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i do think its a very interesting problem to try and solve\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well hope the call is good!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: if you get bored or need a distraction. This video is responsible for all the mouse \/ robot stuff \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZMQbHMgK2rw&pp=ygUKbWljcm9tb3VzZQ%3D%3D}\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: are you all prepped now?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just about :grimacing-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Trying to cover all my bases. Just slightly nervous as don't know what to expect\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But she has replied to my email\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: From the pic you sent it already said it was going to be an informal chat with a question. You'll do great\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: what was the reply?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I just sent a quick email thanking her for her time and that I look forward to speaking with her and she replied same\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: oh nice\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am doing everything I can to nail this\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: dont forget to reset your alarm\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was robot club?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: and make sure your doing all you can to feel as good as possible for tomorrow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm just pottering into bed\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: some interesting techniques. These are very clever people\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: So are you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: not in this room i'm not. Can just about hang on and understand what they talk about but the implementation is beyond me\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I'm not sure how you get to a point of coming up with new ideas\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: pottering - to spend time in a relaxed way doing small jobs and other things that are not very important\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: If you're the smartest person in the room you need to change the room\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: one of the reason i quit my job\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: its nice to be able to learn but also very humbling to be a bit of a dumb dumb\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I get what you mean\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: it very comfortable when your the expert \/ no it all but its also quite boring\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: In bed!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: reset the alarm?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: drugs?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Magnesium\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i hope you sleep well, try not to worry about the call. Just be yourself. Not knowing the answer to a question isn't bad\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll try\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i'll be in the gym when your call is on but we can catch up about it after\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yes! When is your session?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: its just a chat between professionals. No one is on trial and you need to like them just as much as they need to like you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: 7:30\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know. But imposter syndrome and all\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: everyone has that. Only people who don't realise what they don't know think they know everything\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just keep telling me how amazing I am and all the mushy stuff and I'll be fine :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Plus anything you don't currently know that you would need for the job. You will learn \/ they will teach you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: it will all be fine!!!!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That is not what I said :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You are amazing, I really like you, YOU CAN DO THIS JOB, it just a chat about what you have an can do plus them answering your questions.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just the two first bits are enough\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I just noticed that you used to say cute stuff all the time in the beginning\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: "just"\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: HM?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: eh?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hmm?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: oh\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I'm going to have to scroll back and look\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Scroll back to November?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: yes, and see what i'm doing different now\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You just used to say sweet nothings unprompted that's all\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i'm sure i sent something unprompted like 2 days ago\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes definitely this week\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It was just a tease\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: oh, felt like i was making more mistakes\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What mistakes?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Why do you feel you're making mistakes?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i'm not very good at working out if your sometimes being deadly serious or jokinng\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Me neither :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But you said 'more mistakes'\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: not important for now and not something you should be thinking about.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It is though!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You're important to me and what you're feeling is important\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Is everything okay?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Voice call, Answered on other device\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well that whole concept is still very new to me. The bit about my feelings being important\\
I'm guessing its a bad thing to do but I latch on to negative things, as much as I try not to. I feel like I do things by mistake that annoy your or upset you and that you think I am doing them on purpose \/ deliberately.\\A somewhat bad example is yesterday. I'm standing up to cook dinner and you ask "if im happy". Which is a whole trigger phrase for me given that the last time i heard this phrase, 3 minutes later i was on my own and my life changed forever (for the better in the long run). I therefore completely failed to give you the instant answer you expected, which then meant you were upset and I was a little confused. I've processed it a bit more now to understand why the phrase through me so much.\\A simpler example is that I messed up not getting bread for dinner.\\So, I feel like I keep making mistakes and i'm not supporting you the way you need but at the same time I think i am but find out later on that i'm doing it wrong.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Can I call you?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: but you should be going to sleep\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 5 mins\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: ok\\
\section*{Friday $02\textsuperscript{nd}$}
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00008343-GIF-2024-02-02-06-37-37.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not great still, good thing I'm staying home.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How are you? Looking forward to the session?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not great but better than yesterday or still the same? <- you\\
I’m ok, been a little while since over got up early. Bit of a shock but otherwise ok.\\I am looking forward to it. A little apprehensive but it should be good.\\Are you up and pottering?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not as dizzy as yesterday which is good. But headache is back :face-with-rolling-eyes:\\
It will be good to restart routine. When is it you can start spinning again?\\I'm up and getting breakfast\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: The headache is no good but is that better than feeling dizzy?\\
I’ll give spin a miss for another week and then start again. Will try my inside bike towards the end of next week and see what it’s like.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s good that you’ve got some time to get setup and relax before the interview. Then you’ve got all day to potter about.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's better. Hopefully I'll be able to have a proper conversation this morning\\
Ah nice. Everything is progressing. In two week's time you'll be back to normal (and have the answers you need)\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I'm taking it easy. Will look over what I wrote last night and then it's up to the universe I guess\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well, you’re amazing :star-struck: so hopefully you like the sound of the job as well as them offering it to you.\\
You’ll do great in the interview.\\I believe in you.\\I really like you as well :red-heart:\\Good luck x x x x\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
I've written out the questions to ask.\\You're super amazing too! I appreciate you and every little thing you do for me\\Like you. Like loaaads :red-heart:\\Enjoy the gym and go smash that session x x x x\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, definitely different understanding of the paired question today :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But I agree with you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yes and I agree with your one as well.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How’d it go?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m about to leave the gym. Could drop in if you wanted to chat about the interview before you rest?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly, I don't know. It was a good chat. I almost asked more questions than her. I feel like she thought I might be a tad overqualified\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm already back in bed\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good plan\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How was it left?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll hear next week. The next step would be an assessment centre and f2f interview\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That could time well with half term\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I made sure to tell her I knew it was more of an admin role, that I'm still very excited about it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They kind of want next week maybe\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Great. Faster is better.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know you’ll worry about work but that’s separate\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well no because I won't be able to take the time\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Wait to find out first as it still difficult for anyone to suddenly drop a days work at short notice.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But I did say I was on HT after so will be available any time\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They'd want me to deliver training at the assessment day\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: We’ll get some well deserved rest and wait to find out what the next steps are.\\
Let me know what I can do to help\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well that will be easy for you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They are drilling again :weary-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Urgh.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ear plugs?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm weird around adults :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You mean the children don’t know you’re weird.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: <attached: 00008381-AUDIO-2024-02-02-09-13-18.opus>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Or that’s a very aggressive vibrator\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh they do but are better with it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was gym?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: People remember training when there it’s qwerky\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And the adults want to be taught which I’m not sure is true for children.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Gym was good. Need to build back some strength. The top end drops off FAST\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know my materials inside out and can go without prep. This will be veeeery different\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It does but you'll get it back up quickly\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Remember that you’ll be up against people who might have never taught before\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It will be clear your comfortable in that environment\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You will\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Even though she really made sure I know it's admin so I don't know why I'm delivering :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Probably part of their standard testing\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Corporate rules\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's a tiny team 2+the role + part timer\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Nice\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Assuming they are nice people\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Gym in site too\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They really seem like it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s good, you have to travels miles to get to the gym normally :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: She asked if I'd be alright with training days sometimes starting at 8.30 and I was like I leave the house at 6.30, it would absolutely be no problem :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: in Cressex as well? That would be tricky to get to :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Like I'm perfect for it. Just give me a go!!!!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m hoping for you and I think they will.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I hope so, too\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just a couple of thoughts for tomorrow. Obviously all changeable depending on how you feel.\\
I could pick you up on the way to park run but would be 7:50.\\Happy to drive you to you massage if that helps.\\Can drive to the comedy thing and take you home after. We can plan for you to stay at mine a different day.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you lovely but I'll drive myself. I'd like to have a slow morning, then will have to come home to have a shower. Massage is in desbox so easy.\\
Did you not want me to come stay tomorrow?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I knew you were going to say that. Rule 2.\\
I very much want you to stay over but if your in pain and not feeling good I also understand that it could more comfortable for you to be at home where you can fully relax\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just checking. I know it can be hard being around me when I'm not well.\\
It would be nice but I also would like to be with you\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It is hard but maybe not in the way you might be thinking. Its hard to see someone I care about be in pain and not be able to do anything or help.\\
I'm well aware that when in pain people are just more sensitive and more short tempered.\\Really I was just trying to be clear that I understand if you'd rather spend the night at your place so at the very least your not getting extra broken sleep.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'd like to spend it with you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also, you help a lot\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your day been?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: going ok, Was nice to be in the gym again. Spoke to my friend Chris. Phil my sparky came round and is going to fix the shower extractor fan on Wednesday next week.\\
Currently in a call about Exoclock. An exoplanet project. Trying to get some help on their software but the meeting is FULL of people who have clearly never worked corporate and not done conference calls.\\Then going to try and fix my shower and research the project I might do for my new module.\\Currently tempted by looking at habitable zones around stars and what planets would count.\\How are you doing?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh wow, you are having a busy and productive day! Well done on everything.\\
They have been drilling literally all day but I managed a little nap over their lunch. Just about to jump in the shower and slowly start getting ready.\\Are you out tonight?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That project idea is really interesting! You'll have to tell me more about it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: day is busy just not on what I should be doing but it does all need doing. Going to have to try and get some of a chapter done tomorrow inbetween park run and us going out.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just started looking at the project and the one about habitability grabbed me. I think it could be interesting. Need to understand a bit more on what the point of the project is but that is part of the first weeks works\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You seem to have done loads today so hopefully it takes it away from another time\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: that was my theory as well. All the jobs need doing and today is a bit more "bitty" with the multiple meetings in.\\
Yes, I;m out at Matt's house tonight for dinner and a few beers with Lester\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: How are they still drilling\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: did they install your thingy first and just doing everyone elses now\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah I did remember you telling me you were doing something tonight. Just couldn't remember. That sounds like a nice evening\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes pretty much. I wasn't supposed to be in so got booked in first.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: hopefully, hope its not too late and I control myself drink wise as obviously up early tomorrow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Do you want me to pick you up on my way back and give you a lift home?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: its not exactly on your way\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't mind\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What time do yyou think it will be?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Probably about 10ish\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: that could work but I can just get a taxi\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The play starts at 7.30 I think. So maybe more like 10.30\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll text you when I'm done and you can decide\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: VERY nice. They fit then. That's good news. Cosy?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Veeeery cosy\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: yay\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Your welcome\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: is that you trying them on or have you washed them already?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Dry clean only :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: NO, for nightwear\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: that seems extreme\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm trying the other bits on and not sure\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: suits and dresses are dry clean only. Bizzar for other things\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Very\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I forgot one of them is crotchless\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, I thought you weren’t ordering anything like that?\\
I mean I really want to see it. Obviously.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That wasn’t a hint for a photo, just in person.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Compromise :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You will. Soon. :winking-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: image omitted\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Holy crap your super hot in that :fire::fire::fire:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :smiling-face-with-halo:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You all set for your night out?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Already out in merletto. When are you heading to Matt's?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: He is picking me up at 6.\\
Enjoy.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you. You too! Will text you later x x x\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your evening going? Was dinner nice?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Going well. Dinner was quite beige :grinning-face:. A good few drinks.\\
You on intermission?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah, what did you have?\\
Yup, just about to start again in a minute. It's quite good. A few jump scares so far\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Pizza and then some generic beige freezer party food.\\
Oh, jump scares can bugger off. They get me all the time and I scream like a small child.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy: we did too\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just in the car, will take me ages to get out of the car park. Do you want me to come pick you up?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yes please.\\
30 plomer green avenue\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. Will probs be half hour\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm here. Do I come in?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah you can do. I’ve got a bit of drink left\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki come let me in\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: <attached: 00008473-AUDIO-2024-02-02-23-05-51.opus>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: When were you mean?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: To be clear. If there is an option for us to be in bed together or me be in bed alone. I want the us in bed together option.\\
Hopefully that answers the “do you want me to stay over?” Question.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: When I was joking with Matt and Lester\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, that was fine. I knew you were just joining in.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh okay. Phew\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Home and will potter into bed at some point :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: At some point? :face-with-tears-of-joy: hopefully in the next few minutes.\\
You looked super hot this evening by the way.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aww thank you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm just looking at the books I got :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00008483-GIF-2024-02-02-23-20-42.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sue got me these beautiful Paulo Coelho books :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have no idea who that is but the cover are cool.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: He's a Brazilian author and I've got quite a few of his books but these are absolute beauties. And the covers are textured\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Another example where I really should read more books.\\
Hope you sleep well tonight.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well you have to concentrate on different kinds of books at the moment. I'm only now getting back into reading. But we can have a look at some books you might enjoy\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night. Sleep well and I'll see you in the morning x x x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\

Looking forward to seeing you tomorrow.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00008493-GIF-2024-02-03-07-02-31.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning!\\
I do like a slow morning so doing everything half speed :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\How did you sleep?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: x x x x x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I fell asleep the sofa first :man-facepalming: only for a few minutes but it through me a bit. Otherwise ok. Just not for very long.\\
I can very much feel that went to the gym yesterday.\\How about you?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no! You should have gone straight to bed :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
It's a good gym feeling though isn't it?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not a lot of sleep but more deep than normal.\\
I should have gone straight to bed but had to make sure to have some water and decompress a bit.\\It is a good feeling. Just not used to it after upper body. Probably didn’t drink enough water yesterday.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah yes, water makes a lot of difference. Make sure you get more in today\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: See you at park run later x x x\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: See you there xxx\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And also awwww at your paired answer :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Missed voice call, Tap to call back\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok, see you there in a bit\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okie doke\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Enjoy your massage\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm not going to bring it. Will see how I do without :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\section*{Sunday $04\textsuperscript{th}$}
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm home\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done. How is :potato:?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Shouting at me\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well potter a drink and drugs and try to get some rest. He’s probably just trying to tell you about his adventures\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you so much for everything\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I definitely didn't plan this morning to go like this\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No one would plan this.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm sorry for the weirdness of it all\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The only weirdness is the dumb things your body does for seemingly no reason.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I mean there is a reason. Autoimmune chronic condition :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Base on Thursday I should have been more insistent on plan 2 and made you go home last night. I could have then bought over breakfast this morning.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well yes but it breaks my rule of following logic.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I hate that I can't stay with you overnight\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And that you had to see me like this\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It is what it is for now and we live close enough that we could still do mornings in bed. Just one of had to drive for 5 minutes first\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Obviously I’d rather not see you in pain but that’s based on you actually not being in pain. Rather than you hiding.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you. But I feel guilty that I'm also ruining your experience. And I haven't even been able to help with your 'recovery'\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I don’t know what experience you me thinking of.\\
As for my recovery you can’t force yourself to be well. I’m sure if you try it makes it worse anyway and I don’t need to think you’re forcing yourself to do things you don’t want to do.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I want to!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I had it all planned!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just have to save the plan.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00008537-VIDEO-2024-02-04-11-04-19.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know I keep saying sorry. But I am (even though I know this is out of my control). I want you to have the best time, enjoy yourself every time we are together\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: PUPPIES :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know you keep saying sorry.\\
We did say January was going to be weird.\\Maybe we need a temporary rule until we can work something out. “Beds aren’t for sleeping”\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's a good rule for the moment\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've pottered into bed and will try to sleep a little more\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you taken extra drugs?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes I have\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I hope they help and you feel at least a bit better after a nap.\\
Totally separate, I think my spare bed mattress is firmer.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I just need to be in less pain\\
Oh I'll try it out next time :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I still really like you. A lot and want to spend time with you and I want us to do things.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I very big like you too. I love spending time with you and want to do everything :red-heart:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am awake, but very much in bed\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Feeling any better?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Still in a whole load of pain.\\
What have you been up to?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: More less or the same?\\
Dad came over and we didn’t fix the shower. Somehow looks like the whole valve is bust. Which is a real pain.\\Just cooking lunch then probably games.\\What are your plans?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I guess less as no crying! Woop\\
Oh no, that is frustrating. But plumber will be able to fix it?\\What are you having for lunch?\\I don't know. I don't know if I should try pushing through or do no moving at all\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Awake and not crying :grinning-face:\\
Everything is fixable. Already seen that if it’s a new part the part is £220 :man-facepalming:\\Plumber coming on Tuesday\\Standard Sunday lunch. Sausage egg beans.\\Probably a little bit of moving so you don’t seize up but keep it all very easy.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oof that's a bit of a part.\\
Haha, do you always have that on Sunday?\\I'll do that. I'm thinking about tomorrow too, don't know what to do\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Pretty much every Sunday. If I’m on my own. Sundays a bit of a cheat day.\\
Well. Give it 2 hours and if you haven’t somehow miraculously recovered back to how you were yesterday morning. I think tomorrow is a very clear and obvious choice.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I love little routines like that :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
Okay I'll do that.\\I should have taken a nap at yours so you could have cuddled me :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Nap at mine would have equaled more pain for you though.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Shhhhh don't come in here with your logic :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: If we are going to abandon logic then it’s just anarchy\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just indulge my romantic fantasies\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sure.\\
In that case we definitely should have napped. Then you could have been woken up by me going down on you.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: So romantic :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How are you feeling? What’s the decision for work?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm just sitting here marking. Not feeling great.\\
Don't know what to do. Worried that when a new job asks for reference I'll get screwed over by the ansences\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s not how reference work and they would be libel if they put that in a reference.\\
A job reference is just about confirmation that you worked X job within the time frame.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Plus they then not offering you a job based on a disability is an even bigger no no.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So what I’m saying is. Don’t worry about because that is illegal.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And based on what you said it sounds like you should take the day.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Schools do ask for number of absent days and I remember my recruiter did ask back in the day too\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think I'm going to text my boss\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And say\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That I'm taking one more day\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh, good\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I hate doing this\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I need to get better\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Then you need to take the day off\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: See how that works :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I meant in general :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well yes\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: New job more calm\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What if it doesn't help\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: With that logic you might as well worry and worrying\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's a reasonable worry considering how much worse I've been the past year\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sort of but if you worry about that the stress of it will just make it all worse.\\
You were doing really well when you had December off and then it gone downhill since being back at school.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ha yes. The life of lady of leisure suits me :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thus the logic of a new job helping does make sense\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You and your logic\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I very much appreciate you being so level headed\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It is the way.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Logic does take a beating when you’re in pain though.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Very much so\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Work is sorted\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done. That something less to worry about\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The carpenter will be able to come whenever it works for them tomorrow\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Will still be between 4-4:30.\\
If you like I can come to yours for 4\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That would be great. Are you doing gym tomorrow?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, going with Toria at 7am tomorrow.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah good :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How is she doing?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Will find out tomorrow. Seems like she is doing a bit better. She is mentally more up for the exercise stuff and has got back into running.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's good :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Isn’t that the winter run day?\\
She is a good teacher. I did her advanced front crawl class a year ago at the lido.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha it is!\\
But I meant more like in general. I have a prepaid card for westhorpe\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh. It’s the only place I’ve done open water swimming outside of the triathlons.\\
It’s flipping cold and last year the weeds were all over the place. If you just go it’s only £5. So cheap for swimming.\\Does need a wetsuit and a floaty thing.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know. I've been going all autumn :face-with-tears-of-joy:. I've got all the gear. And it's only £4.50 with the card. I was literally just asking of you fancied coming with me some time\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well not the wetsuit\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, that is not how I read the question. Yes I’d like to go with you. We had already discussed it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh have we?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And how did you read it?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Soz, foggy brain\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I thought you were asking for opinions on Sue as a teacher\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aaaah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your afternoon\/evening been?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok games but that’s been about it. Just having my cheese dinner.\\
Are you feeling any better \/ different\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Cheese dinner?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I feel a little better. Haven't really done much tbh\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Cheese and biscuits. Plus the donut you bought me.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well that’s good and didn’t you mark things. That’s doing stuff\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: More than I did, given I just played video games.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I didn't know what your cookie was so only got you the donut\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I like doing little nice things for you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The donut is good.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Michelle just texted to tell you thank you for the wine and it was absolutely lovely\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s kind of her. They are nice people\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They are lovely\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: In bed now. Have taken half a melatonin and hopefully it will be enough.\\
Hope games with Matt were good\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You managed to cut a gummy in half? Well done.\\
Games were just ok. Some frustrating games and moments.\\Really hope you get some rest and feel better in the morning. Hope spud lets you sleep as well.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha yeah. Just conscious of the high dose so I'm trying it out.\\
Thank you. Me too.\\Hope you sleep well and you're fresh for the gym.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night x x x x\\
P.S. I like you\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night x x x x x x x x x\\
\section*{Monday $05\textsuperscript{th}$}
I like you as well.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00008639-GIF-2024-02-05-06-19-49.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x\\
Yes, I think you did.\\I feel like I had more rest but pain is still there, but not as much as yesterday morning which is good.\\Hope gym sesh with Toria is good :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Really Glad it’s not as bad as yesterday but I’m guess still worse than Saturday?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yea definitely still worse than Saturday. Hopefully taking it easy today will sort me out\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I hope so.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was gym? I went back to bed\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’d assumed that’s what you’d done. Either that or a 10km jog.\\
Gym was good. Followed the plan Hannah sent me. Some evil. Took ages and I nearly ran out of time for my shopping. I did save one of the moves for next time as it would have been a little bit squashy on the downstairs.\\So is that nap 1 of 2 done for the day. Did it help?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah glad you had a good session. What was the squishy move?\\
Just the one nap. Need to be able to fall asleep tonight.\\I'm going to try moving around and see.\\What's your plan for today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Inverse sit-ups with a 20kg weight.\\
Good luck with pottering :grinning-face:\\Need to shower then crack on with some work. Will email the PhD people after lunch as no doubt I won’t have heard anything. Which is a pain.\\Then seeing you for a little bit.\\Games later.\\Have you got counselling \/ book club today?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What is an inverse sit-up?\\
Yup, got counselling tonight and book club tomorrow\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ops incline. Not inverse. Sits up on the incline bench that is next to the weird fan bike.\\
Do you have to go out for book club or is that a zoom type thing?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aaaah yes I know which one.\\
Not sure yet. Hoping it will be a zoom one\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Don’t forget the paired question. It’s an odd one today.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It is but I don't know the answer :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :face-with-rolling-eyes: you've never spent any money that has made sex better or more interesting?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've spent money on myself\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: maybe that's the answer then\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Maybe\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Could I ask you for a favour?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You can always ask.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: My friend sent me a parcel and it's currently waiting at the inpost locker at morissons. Would you mind stopping there in your way here?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sure. Send me the info.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I just had an accidental sofa nap for 10 minutes.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I had an accidental bed nap :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did you email the PhD people?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did the nap help?\\
Yes I have emailed.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The resting is helping but I'm still quite fuzzy and all over the place. And hurty\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not heard anything back?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just checked\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh hun\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That is so bloody shit\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Could you ask them for further feedback?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I am about to\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm here for whatever will help\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you decided on work tomorrow?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 70\/30.\\
When my HOD texted earlier she said to take tomorrow too but I'm still thinking\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Pre approved by HOD.\\
Take it and tell them before end of day.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Leaving now\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was lemon chicken?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was ok, never quite as good when cooked from frozen.\\
How was the session?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It was alright. A lot around the health stuff\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: \url{https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGekxFLV2/}\\
Maybe not the bracelets\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I am crap at puzzles but otherwise yes. We have more games to play\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: I look forward to more 'date' dates when I'm not all crappy and tired\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That will be fun.\\
We can start small. Have 2 new cards games to try plus trying the one we already played once and I have a balance Tetris game to try out.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Can't wait :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
I'm in bed with a book now. How were the games?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Games are ok. Had a good win.\\
It’s very variable.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Really hope you rest well and feel a bit better in the morning.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well I hope you've enjoyed yourself\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you. Me too\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night. Sleep well x x x x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night x x x x x x x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: A good distraction tonight\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm here. I know you might not want to talk about it but I'm here x x x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know but you’ve got more than enough of your own stuff at the moment.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And you take them on with me. Let me help and take some of your bits on too. That's how relationships work :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know but I’m trying to take some of your stress away not add to it.\\
\section*{Tuesday $06\textsuperscript{th}$}
Other than just bitch about being annoyed I’m not sure what to do at the moment. Needs more processing.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x\\
Oki. I'm here for whatever you need in any case. Even if it's just a vent.\\How did you sleep?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00008700-GIF-2024-02-06-08-07-37.mp4>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How did you sleep and how are you feeling?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no! Have you had enough water yesterday?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm feeling clearer in the head and less pain. I'm not going to go mental today with movement but hopefully on the way out of this now\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ouch that is naff deep sleep but good duration. Really glad it’s better.\\
As good as Saturday morning or still worse?\\Drank a shed load of water yesterday. It’s  not a dehydration headache.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Still a bit worse but getting there.\\
Oh! Do you know where it's coming from? Stress?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah it’s a stress headache.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh booo\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What's the plan for today?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not sure on the grand plan. I have work to do but part of brain is screaming “why bother”\\
I at least need to email the HOD.\\Might go for a walk.\\Plumber is coming over\\And I’m meant to have a tutorial tonight.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know what you mean, but not all is lost!\\
Definitely send out the emails, you never know.\\Walk is a great idea :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, I know. Just wish the emotion would burn off faster.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You've got to give it time. Your feelings are absolutely valid. Just sit with the feelings a little bit and let it process :purple-heart:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I find the emotion gets in the way of the processing and they need to burn off first.\\
I do know that in this case they are at least valid.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Are you just pottering today? Another nap?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just don't bury them\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah. I'm doing some marking now, nap and then pottering :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Marking and nap done?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nap done. I left half the marking undone\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your day been so far?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So you’ve done half the marking then.\\
Been ok, not done much. Emailed the HOD, drifted, had a walk. Just having lunch.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sounds like the type of morning you needed.\\
What are you having for lunch?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just having Huel. Super exciting.\\
What’s your plans for the rest of the day?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: So exciting! What flavour?\\
I've made the Greek Mac and cheese\\I don't know, probably not much. Need to shower and wash my hair and then the book club\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Been trying to chocolate one.\\
Oh well done.\\Super rave afternoon.\\I still don’t understand how women can shower and not get your hair wet. It’s basically the first thing men do. Shower = hair. :grinning-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know, I'm living the rock'n'roll life.\\
I can't (and we shouldn't) wash my hair every day! That's what shower caps are for :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: that really ruins the sexiness of showering. The cap\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: This is a good email\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: he is really good\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Obviously doesn't solve the issue at hand but good advice\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: So so sexy\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Does the email help?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: yes and no. Out of a list of 50 applicants. No way i am at the top of that list. So that does explain it.\\
This bit hints at something i feared anyway "with applicants from various UK universities as well as European and other overseas students"\\I tick zero DEI boxes and I;m already not at the top of the list.\\So lets pretend i have an MSc. I'm still not going to be at the top and i will lose on DEI scoring. If i'm going to be up against 15 people per PhD they are never going to let me in\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Does it help with making a decision on next steps?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: no, it just 100\% confirms that i wont start a PhD this year\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. I'm happy to listen of you want to talk through options etc\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Right now i dont even know where to start\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And that's okay. I'm here when you're ready\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hmm, I don't know. I only know of my friends who've applied for PhDs after they had their MAs already. They took a stop gap job in the field and then did the PhD. Would that be an option? If you have to complete the MSc? But would that mean 3 extra years?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: yeah, 3 extra years from now then wait till the following year to see if you get in\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ooooof\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Would you have the means? Would you want to do it?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i have no idea\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's a tough situation\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: probably yes on the means but if i have to put in 2 or 3 years more work to "maybe" be considered\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's a big decision\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: might be becuase i'm in a bad mood but from that last email it seems very clear that they just look at the marks you get and not the person. In 2+ more years my industry experiance will basically be nullified. So i'll just be an old white guy who used to work who has some grades in some stuff that aren't better than some of the other people who applied.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: its actually gone full circle to me needing an MSc\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You might be feeling it a bit more at the moment.\\
I wish I had some groundbreaking advice. But I'll be here to support you with the decision\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: \url{https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGekp5bGo/}\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: 6 I can’t do and I think I’d be in trouble for number 10\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Why can't you do 6?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You don’t let go first\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahahah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was plumber?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The shower is broken\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Basically it needs a new unit\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh lord\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Like the whole whole thing?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: There is a small chance it is covered on warranty but I don’t think so. So it will be £220 for the new box.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oof\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did he say why it could be broken?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think I’m about to spend the same getting the extractor fan fixed as well.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Nope, just it stopped working.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Bathrooms are so pricey\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not just bathrooms\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well yes\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s all expensive\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You know what I meant\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you doing the tutorial?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you hear anything about the job?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not yet\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think I'll email tomorrow\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No, it not what I thought it was. It for questions about the current assignment and troubleshooting the software we have had to use.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm a bit worried now\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah okay\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Nothing to worry about yet.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What are you up to tonight?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And what can I do to cheer you up?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Going to have a bit of a play with my robot to see if I can fix a bug it has and work out how to build the next one. So that I have stuff to talk about tomorrow.\\
You don’t need to do anything, just concentrate on taking care of yourself.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's a productive evening!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-rolling-eyes: let me show you I care about you!!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: If I get something working it will be.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know you care but at the moment you’re in pain from just moving around. So anything I ask for is just going to cause you more pain.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's still productive even if you just work on it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: True\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You are not inconveniencing me. I want to do stuff for you. You are more than worthy of me doing stuff.\\
I know you have a hard time accepting these kind of things but please let me\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ignoring you being unwell. I’m not even sure what I would ask for.\\
We also aren’t seeing each other until Sunday.\\But you aren’t well, which is partly my fault if not entirely my fault. So asking for anything knowing it will hurt you just seems wrong to me.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: My wonderful, wonderful man - my flare up is none of your fault. Please hear that loud and clear. I love that you care so much about how I'm feeling, but you are equally important\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: how was book club?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Still going\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did I make you feel awkward?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: a bit, I thought there might have been a follow up message but there wasn't and then an odd amount of time had passed <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What kind of follow up did you think\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I'm not entirely sure. Maybe I was just hoping for something to reply to.\\
I take it your going to school tomorrow?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes I am\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did you manage to get the robot working?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: funny you should ask\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: it just did what it was meant to. Just\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00008802-VIDEO-2024-02-06-21-46-04.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well done\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I thought there was something to reply to\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Book club is done. Will potter my way to bed soon\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What was there to reply to\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: there is no question here and I still disagree RE fault.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okay\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm hoping I read this in a different tone to what you meant.\\
If me telling you stuff like that makes you uncomfortable, you need to tell me\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I didn't mean any sort of tone, I just had no idea how to reply. What you said was nice. I just have no idea what sort of things I can or should be asking for.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You can ask for anything :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But I get it. As long as everything is on the table :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Maybe I need a list of examples (not now) as the only stuff my mind has come up with would all be no anyway.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha. Okay\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you excited about the robot working?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: yeah I am pretty pleased its doing what I told it to do. It is a stupid amount of work to make it do what you see in the video.\\
Pretty sure I just now need to start on the new one. This one is just diminishing returns. Its too big. Cables flapping about. The front sensor doesn't work right and the whole sensor arrangement is easily battered into the wall.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It does seem like a complicated beast.\\
What's the new one?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: the new one is a big bag of bits and an image in my mind\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha okay. What will it do?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: hopefully it will at least do what the current one does but be smaller, faster and not hit the walls so much. Also nice if the new sensors (not built yet) work better for front walls.\\
Then version 3 will use a whole new sensor board once I can buy them of Duncan\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh wow!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Some serious robot building\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: plus I need to check it will work on a full size maze as I think I have a code issue at full size. Then if the v3 sensors work it will be about going faster but that is a whole thing. Got to get to the centre and back reliably first\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How long do you think it will take you?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: absolutely ages\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Long term project\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: oh yeah\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: v2 i'd like for March when I go for the weekend and then v3 for the summer comp\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: V2 is soon!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: yeah, Planning on starting it this weekend to get the new sensor board built. See if I can work out how to mount everything. No doubt need to design and print some more brackets\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did you say you were out Saturday night?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: nope\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: wed, thurs, fri but not Sat\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Maybe I could pop by after brunch of it's not late?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh you social butterfly\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sure, that would be nice\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: like buses, nothing or everything\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Right, bed time for this pumpkin\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
Hope your feel more betterer in the morning\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night. Sleep well x x x x x x x x\\

Me too\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00008843-GIF-2024-02-07-08-20-09.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I asked Dave (plumber) about the shower. He recommends the Triton T80Z.\\
\url{https://www.tritonshowers.co.uk/t80z-fast-fit-duelec-electric-shower}\\That looks to be a fancier one with the rain head or just a normal one is quite a bit cheaper.\\He recons you’d be ok to go to 9.5kw.\\Somewhere around £60-90 to fit 2 taps. I forgot to ask about the shower but it guess in total around £150 to for shower and both taps if he’s doing it all at once.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm at work. Got told off for being here. Had to bring the stick in\\
How are you?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I didn't have internet for a bit for some reason\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you so much for asking. I'd definitely like for him to do all at the same time. Just need to buy the bits. Fancy a trip to Wickes on Sunday?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good for being told off. I think. It good that they also want you to follow rule 1.\\
I’m ok. Going to go to the gym for a quick bench session as I need to go to Toolstation anyway. Going to try and do some work but very much in the “why bother” mindset still.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: WTF is this. How did you get soo much deep sleep.\\
It’s good but how did you get so much.\\How do you feel?\\Although based on the last 2 days I’m guessing the body just gave in.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: All at once makes sense. Yes we can go to wicks.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Gym is good! Well done on going.\\
Give yourself a couple of days to wallow and then get back into it :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I thin my body just gave up. But no rem so not feeling the best rested\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Brill :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
What else do you fancy doing on Sunday?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Was a bit of a shit session but at least I went.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Erm, I have no idea. Was going to see how you were feeling. There is obvious stuff is like to do and wicks will take a while plus food. Walk might be nice and we can plan out what needs to be done. Maybe start car shopping. <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Either school WiFi is broken or you might need to power cycle your phone to reset the internet\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's the main thing\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's quite the perfect plan. Definitely would like to do a walk if it's not raining\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm not on school WiFi. And I did restart my phone :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: In trying to plan out Sunday are we spending all day together? Really I’m asking about dinner :grinning-face:. All plans centre around food.\\
Not sure how you want to start the day but I could bring over mc Donald’s? Then wicks.\\Walk wise I have 2 thoughts. Could walk from mine over the park and get a drink from the nation trust place or we could head out west Wycombe park up go for a walk near the golden ball and get drink \/ lunch (if needed) from the apple orchard.\\I have no idea about dinner and I know you want us to spend more time at your place.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll have to have a nap somewhere in there :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Oh I could do breakfast at mine, then walk west Wycombe and apple orchard (haven't been there yet), a little nappy nap and then I can come to yours and do dinner? I'm happy to cook if you want\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Plus shopping.\\
I’ll have a think about dinner but that plan works.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes yes, Wickes too\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your day going?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Slow. Gym, toolstation, cleaned kitchen. Sat. About to shower and then maybe just speed read a chapter.\\
How are you doing?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you emailed about job?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haven't had a chance\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Should I email or wait?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I don’t think an email will hurt.\\
“Hey just checking to see if there is any news on the assessment day. I’m available XXX days next week. Look forward to  next steps”\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki I'll send one\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Done\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sounds like a productive day\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thanks, never feels like I do productive days.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Absolutely most of your days are productive!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00008878-GIF-2024-02-07-14-47-35.mp4>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Whoop\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You’re going to panic now until Wednesday?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No, I'll be happy until I get more info and then I'll panic until Wednesday :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I get to go home earlier because I'm crippled :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yay, I think. Directed time is a pain anyway so good to miss it.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What's you plan for this evening?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Rest. I'm absolutely pooped and hurting. Katie might pop in for a cuppa but not sure. Probably a bath. Are you with your robot buddies tonight?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: bath is always a good idea. Do you still have your CBD stuff?\\
Yes on robot stuff. Picking Andrea up at 7:10 from the train station.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes I do but will need to make a run to the market next time it's on.\\
Should be a good evening for you?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It should be good, there is always something interesting new to learn and good to see what other people have been working on\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Bit of luck finally. My shower is being fixed next thursday\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Woo hoo\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Everything works out\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: it does all work out in the end\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: One way or another\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: My huge stack of paper work in the spare room, sometimes pays off\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What do you mean?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just lucky I keep a lot of paper work as I needed prove of purchase and found the invoice from the plumber.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Could have very easily thrown it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ooh so you're getting it done through Insurance?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Aqualisa are fixing it themselves. Not seen a company do that before given they didn’t fit it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well that's good\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Paying anything?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Nope\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Brilliant!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So that saves me at least £220\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Plus the plumber\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Exactly.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well done\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Although I would have fitted the new bit myself\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Still\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Depending on what happens with your interview next week we can always move Valentine’s Day to a different day if needed and \/ or combine with our 3 months.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We can definitely combine the two but I'd still like to see you in Wednesday, whatever happens. And in any case it will be in the daytime\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah it will be day time but could be an intense few hours.\\
I was planning on picking up m\&s food on Tuesday after spin and was planning on making pancakes Tuesday, if you like.\\I can try making thin UK ones for you as well.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The Tuesday will be the crunch time prep wise. Hopefully I'll be in reasonable enough state to be fed :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I wasn’t implying we’d spend all of Tuesday together just that I could provide you with dinner\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I didn't think you were implying that\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just a heads up I'll be frazzled and manic\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Already thought of that\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thus just dinner :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You paint a lovely picture of me :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I thought I was demonstrating that I understand you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You were :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Rule \#2\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I got it.\\
Don’t pre panic about the interview. You’ll do great.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not panicking just yet. Saving that for my worry time tomorrow :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You can have 5 minutes :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well worry time is 15mins sooo\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: 15 minutes is ok. That much less than all day.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We'll see when they sent over the info. I have never done an assessment day so have absolutely no idea\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: From what you said I imagine it will be a demo of teaching and then some standard personality profile tests.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Boooooooo\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But the role isn't delivery :grinning-face-with-sweat:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Might just be the tests then. I guess you’ll find out tomorrow\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: We always had people do some sort of presentation in the final interview\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But Amanda did say something about presenting soooo :loudly-crying-face::loudly-crying-face::loudly-crying-face::loudly-crying-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm great in front of hundreds of teenagers but peers... different story\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You literally present and teach for at least 5 hours every day\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Teenagers are WORSE\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah but I'm all weird and showy\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And make cringe jokes\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well save the jokes for the first day\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's my thing, all kids know it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Or they might work\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I get so nervous and I talk so fast\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Breath\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm off to bed with a book. Hope you had a good evening.\\
Night night, sleep well x x x x x x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night x x x x x x\\
\section*{Thursday $08\textsuperscript{th}$}
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x\\
How was last night? Did you have a good time?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Morning x x x x x\\
Just woke up.\\Yeah it was good. Was a late night and Took me a long time to decompress. Always gives a lot to think about.\\How are you feeling today?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah glad you had a good time.\\
I'm struggling but getting in with things. Parents evening and I am completely and utterly booked up for the whole 4 hours, it will be terrible.\\How's your day looking?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Urgh, I forgot you had another parents evening. So do the kids have a half day today then and do you have a half day tomorrow?\\
Not really sure on today. Feeling quite lost at the moment.\\Phil (sparky) had to cancel, so I don’t really have any excuse not to do work.\\Meeting Chris later for a drink and might have some time for a couple of games.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes to the kids, no to tomorrow.\\
Maybe getting down to some work and routine will be helpful? You've been put of routine pretty much since Christmas so it might be nice to get back to it? Might help the head.\\I guess you'll have to start making decisions soon in terms of next steps.\\Or just cross this week completely off and go to the gym and sort stuff at home?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: All of those options are valid :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
I am getting back into the overall routine which is nice.\\The only decision I’ve sort of made is that it’s probably sensible to drop the new module before it costs me anything. There really isn’t a huge amount of personal interest I would gain from completing it regardless of next steps.\\I keep going round and round. Seems to be a certainty that I need a MSc to be considered for a PhD. Which was my original plan from 2 years ago.\\I might now be able to get on one but and this is the biggest or buts. Even if that was true and I get it down. Based on this weeks Information I’m not convinced it will be enough. It would be extremely unlikely that I could get a first in any masters and even if I did I still don’t think they will let me in with so many people applying for this stuff. I’ll just straight up lose to any international student.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: PhD programmes are incredibly competitive. You're going for 1 or 2 places against what 15-20 people each. So I understand that side of things.\\
Why don't you think you could get a first from a MSc?\\What are the other options?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll drop some marks somewhere during an MSc and miss the first. Some of the maths I know I won’t understand enough to get.\\
Other option outside of studying? Don’t have a short list yet.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What if you don't? What if you knuckle down and smash it?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Then it goes back around to the competition being super high. Even if I get a first they still won’t let me in.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Positive thoughts.\\
I'm not saying that the studying is the only option but just reminding you what you tell me. What if it all works out?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know, it’s just hard to see that at the moment when a lot of it is out of my control.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know.\\
It's far from an ideal situation but it will work out\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sorry you have to hear me moaning, especially while you’re suffering.\\
I do know how fortunate I am to be sat in my own house and not really worrying about paying bills.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh please don't apologise.\\
You're not moaning at all. It's a shitty situation and I want you to be able to talk it through with me\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good luck with parents.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thaaaanks :weary-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hannah had her baby.\\
baby girl arrived Tuesday morning at 3:26am, weighting 7Ib 2oz and currently nameless.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Eeey that's amazing. Pass on my congratulations on the nameless child\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm not even half way through and want to defenestrate myself\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your afternoon?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well I just had to look up that word. Don’t throw yourself out a window. It’s lots of paper work.\\
Doing some work, not sure how good that’s going but it’s going. At the very least I don’t feel as behind.\\You only need to survive a little longer then you can go home.\\You can do it. Plus, I like you x x x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: My neighbour has been building something for 2 days. Sounds like he is building it in my house. Not a problem but I cannot see what it is and I want to see.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I love that word :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Well done on doing the work!\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha, nosey Nelly.\\
Tell me when you find out\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Interesting presentation. 8 slides max then minus opening and closing slides\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: is that all the info you have. Just a 20 minute presentation to do on the day?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: My brain is not even computing\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup they said timings etc in an email tomorrow\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Think he is building a lean to \/ shed thing down the side of the house\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I'd guess some sort of chat before and or after as well but that is a lot less than I thought they might ask for\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Happy to help as best I can with getting it all setup\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah 10 mins presentation, 10 mins follow up questions, and then the email said discussion\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes please, thank you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not for now but you could easily get ChatGPT to spit out suggestions on how to answer that question and then fill in the detail\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ooooooh indeed\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think Monday will be the bulk of prep and then on Tuesday I can just tweak and go over it to prep\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sounds like a good plan. Save the panic until Monday\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Didn't say that :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m saying save the panic until Monday. No point panicking at all really but best to save it for when you’re actually doing the work.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know what you were saying :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
You never know, I might have a freestyle panic tomorrow :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 10 more kids\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Keep going\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 2 more\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Kill me now please\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No, I’m willing to do things to you but not that .\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hooome time\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done. You survived.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm not sure\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What time are you meeting Chris?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Been and gone. Just about to drive home now\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oooh\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was it?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was pretty good. Got a funny story out of it for when we are in person.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just about to drive\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Drive safe\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Always. Back home now just cooking dinner.\\
How are you doing?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am so absolutely wiped\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But treated myself to big tasty so I have eaten :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done. Take away on parents evening is a must\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am poopy pooped. And not even an early finish tomorrow :loudly-crying-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Were you doing something tomorrow evening? Or can you rest before brunch.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah, I've got the monthly counselling thing after work and then can rest\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not out out though. So that good.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh definitely not\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Other than being knackered how is the pain compared to Saturday. Still higher?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah, I'm still on the walking stick\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Looks like it’s going to rain on Sunday anyway. So more chance to rest\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'd still love a walk in between rain if possible ( but I might also be shattered for pottering around shops :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:)\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Need to prioritise Wednesday.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes! For both job and you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 3408 out of 21000 made it through\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Me??\\
Just job.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Of course you too\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Or he wanted food :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: He was fed before me\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh course he was\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Of\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I was an hour late for dinner time\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I didn't send you this morning's data :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh god. Completely the other way. Good total time\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly there's no rhyme or reason\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Logic has to win. There is logic somewhere\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Wheree? <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Some where\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Maybe over the rainbow :rainbow:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahahah\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The deep sleep makes the least sense. Would need to start tracking spuds movements at night to see if there is any correlation\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly he's been solid by my knees the whole time. I wake up to him in the exact spot he fell asleep in\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: hmm. The best 2 for deep sleep was the other day and your birthday\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well there was a definite extra special add in on my birthday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: More experiments needed\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Indeedy\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Still need you to do your own experiments which I’m guessing you have not had the energy for.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh absolutely not. I'm comatose by the time I'm in bed\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s understandable. Maybe it needs to be like the gym and you need to do it when you get home before dinner :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahahah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well I'm in bed now and ready for some zzz\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night, sleep well x x x x x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night x x x x x x x x x\\
\section*{Friday $09\textsuperscript{th}$}
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00009055-GIF-2024-02-09-06-15-57.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x\\
You are up early! Gym?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, meeting up with Toria and going to go through the plan from Hannah\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Early hurts but better than going this afternoon\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How you doing?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well done! What's on the plan for this morning?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Meh, not great but hey ho\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ouch, that is not a lot for you.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No :disappointed-face: just couldn't fall asleep\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Plan today is legs. I vaguely remember the plan and think it has a lot of lunges and other nasty things\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Already panicking about the job?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not at all\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just really hurty last night and physically and emotionally shattered\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :crying-face::red-heart:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I had 4.5 mins appointments between 2.05 and 6.25 with a quick 15mins break\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Every single slot was taken\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Urgh, that is brutal. It’s a lot of context switching as well.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just gotta get through today and you’ve got a week off\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup yup\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just enough time to feel human again before it all starts again\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Finishing the day on my horrendous y10 class and it's a non uniform day\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Shoot me now\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I already gave the answer to such requests\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Make them watch a film in Spanish\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not allowed\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Rubbish\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But my y8s did a cooking project so at least that will be fun\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00009085-GIF-2024-02-09-06-26-03.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh their photo recipes are brilliant!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They already did at home. We're just looking at them\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: They still made a mess\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Of course. But their parents cleaned up. Not me\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you doing gym on Monday?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That was my primary thought for doing pancakes at my house. The mess\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yes I will be but planning on spin first\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And one less cat\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah ok. I'll go on Monday morning\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hadn’t even factored that in to the flour mess but another good point\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: He'd be covered\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Everything would get covered\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Do you find out more about the job today or do you have all the information?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I should get the timings etc today\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ooof. Enjoy\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Enjoy! That sucked.\\
Change of plan. Gym Monday  morning.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well done though! You've done it.\\
Brill, I'll join you then. Why the change of plan?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Toria is out with work and wants to get her gym session done over spin. I’ll spin Tuesday Thursday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Delaying spin has to be better for downstairs\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's downstairs feeling?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Bit of a brain dump of thoughts.\\
Thinking about what your priorities might be for the week.\\Job, bathroom (shower and taps and then get Dave booked in) and car?\\Maybe we can car shop Thursday but will depend when my shower is getting fixed. I’ll know more on Tuesday.\\With the car. Need to do an insurance check fiat vs the ford to see if there is any difference.\\I was going to suggest putting a Honda jazz into the mix as they are cheap but I’ve seen insurance is £2500 due to catalytic converter theft.\\Do you have money to buy the car or will it be on credit? Really the question is do we have to buy from a dealer or is private an option?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Pretty good. The wound has fully healed. Some oddness now and then and still a bit of a bruise but it all still works.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, those bits I'd like to get sorted. I'm seeing Niall in London on Thursday afternoon though.\\
I was thinking throwing the i10 in instead? And yes, definitely need to do an insurance comparison.\\It will be on credit card\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well I'm glad it still works :grinning-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i10 instead of the jazz? I like the  i10 super small and bits are cheap. Not exciting but will run forever.\\
Not sure if it’s estate agents or car dealers I dislike the most. :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’d read a bit of a horror story of someone that waited to long to test it all out. So there seems to be a sweet spot to test all it out.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Friday for car shopping then.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Another random thought because I don’t know. Could buying the car affect your remortgage?\\
I’m not sure if they look at loans or debt as part of the process.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes. I don't even know how the jazz looks like\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did you test it out?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's all sorted already. And I'm staying with my lender so they haven't done affordability checks in 4 years\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Moot now as the thing is uninsurable\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yes, that’s what I meant when I said it all still works.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: One less thing off the list then.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just checking\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is some full on corporate buzz word list.\\
Surprisingly long.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Probably TMI but I’ve started a note so I can keep count to make sure I hit the right number before the test.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know. Freaking out a bit\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not tmi at all\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No freaking out.\\
It’s just a bunch of talking about stuff you know how to do.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You’ll do really well.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll need to do some proper prep for all of this. I haven't had a corp interview in well over 10 years\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Google and ChatGPT are your friend. Freaking out is the enemy <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes I know but :face-screaming-in-fear::nauseated-face::face-screaming-in-fear:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What's the plan for today?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Having a quick couple of games. Call with my friend at 11.\\
My mum is coming over later and then I have dinner with Becky this evening.\\Will do something in the afternoon but not sure what.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: \url{https://www.thesalarycalculator.co.uk/} this might be good to have a play with\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I've been using it since last year.\\
In case of j\&j I have no idea about pension etc so can't do an accurate calculation\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: you can play around though. Normally you can set your own percentage contributation. EY would let me do up to 6\%\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: EY had a cool portal so you could change all the stuff from month to month if you really wanted\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I did it with the civil service jobs.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah that's nice\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But I still have to get the job!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yes, i'm pretty sure you'll get it.\\
It was more to play with the website to work out what your short term hard limits on salary would be\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't jinx it!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: not jinxing it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Work done? Whoop.\\
Good luck with the councillor.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just finished that. Was very quick.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But got stuck in traffic so had to do it driving :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your afternoon been?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh that is fast. Is it not a fixed time session then?\\
Literally spent the afternoon talking to my mum.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ve also remembered today.\\
DRUGS\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You're so early, I'll forget :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not these ones. These are just light touch ones now\\
Did you enjoy it?\\How's your mum doing?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah it was fun. An hour less would have been a better.\\
She is doing fine. Goes on holiday in a week or so. Had a lot of child care over the last week and had to get the kids to school today.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You all set to rest tonight?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Looking forward to brunch?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sounds nice.\\
It's such a foreign concept for me that she just drops by to catch up :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\Is your mum fully retired?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yes. I'll have a half hour nap, then potter, then bath and bed.\\
When are you off to Becky's?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes I think I am\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well it was booked in earlier in the week.\\
Yeah fully retired. They both are.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Still. You know what I mean. The closeness you have. I meant it in a positive way\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Becky’s for 18:30 and see how she’s been doing. Get to play with dog as well.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Lovely evening :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: do you know what you're having?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know, just wanted it to be clear she doesn’t drop in unannounced\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was curry but it can change on the day. So I’m hoping curry.\\
I know she’s had issues with her kids this weeks that means she’s had to interact with her ex.\\Should get some good dating story’s. At least I hope there funny and not sad.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: What are you planning for your sleep. Drugs?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes drugs\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Curry sounds nice! Hope it happens\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was really checking to see if you would take drugs to give yourself the best chance\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What are your timings from brunch?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 2.30 in Marlow so easy morning for me\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, that’s lunch. It bough it was 11 somewhere\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That late for lunch\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Meh it's something\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's a get together :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No food!!!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Of course there's food\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You know me better than that\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just checking. Such an odd time for food. Would have me twitching\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No rules :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: At least you can have a nice slow morning.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes! Definitely need it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Will you be park running?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is the plan. Toria is running it for the first time so I should go.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh amazing!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You're a good friend\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I try. If I’m not there she will just go home :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: and she doesn’t really have an excuse as she is staying at her parents and they live behind the rye\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, well hope her first time goes well\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Enjoy the time at Becky's\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you napped already or saving it?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Napped already. Itty bitty cat nap. With a cat\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: \url{https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGeBBfv8Q/}\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hope you have a slow morning, feel a bit better and enjoy spending times with your friends.\\
I got a couple of funny stories out of Becky to share when I see you.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x\\
I'm up. I woke up my original time and then went back to sleep.\\Hope parkrun is good for you. Are you going to run?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Me too :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
Did you have a good time yesterday?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Going to “run” it. So run walk really. Just know it’s going to suck and it’s going to wet and muddy.\\
Last night was fun but Becky has been dealt a bit of a bad hand in life. Just hoping some of her luck turns around soon. Especially in getting some successful dates.\\Becky was clearly both pleased but a bit jealous that her sister has just started dating a new guy who is absolutely minted, proper millionaire spec.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you naturally wake up early or did the fur bag do it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You'll feel better after having done it. Hope it's not too boggy.\\
Glad you had a good time.\\Aaah we all have those time. Hopefully she comes out of it soon!\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: He was the alarm the first time. He obviously doesn't want me to oversleep for work, and I needed the loo.\\
Second time it was naturally and he was still asleep\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Fur bag needs a lesson on weekends\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What’s the data like for last night\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Urgh\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But it cut off when I woke up the first timw\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Then that’s less bad\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What are your plans for the morning before you go out?\\
What are you going to be wearing?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Breakfast, shower, hair, everything very slowly.\\
And I have no idea\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: How are you feeling?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hmm, somewhere in between. There's still pain\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So still worse than last Saturday\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, I don't think I could do 5k this morning.\\
Why is last Saturday a benchmark?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Because last Saturday is the last time I saw you were you either went crying in pain or wincing every time you move\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not saying Saturday is the benchmark for good just if it still worse than that then it still very bad\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well when you put it like this it sounds bad :grinning-face-with-sweat: sorry\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Why are you sorry?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So, what do we need to do over the next few days to maximise recovery before Wednesdays interview. Beyond trying to stop you panicking about it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I mean it's not the ideal situation and affects you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s no but it effects you more\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I have nothing except food today, spending time with you tomorrow, gym Monday and vet Tuesday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No = not\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Will you be able to gym?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I really want to. It will be good to move\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I haven't been in two weeks\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Are you eating right? Pill etc, water all that boring bollox\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Your daily chart stuff\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am eating....\\
But yes to vitamins etc\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s good at least\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Today’s paired question was a bit naff. We need to go over yesterday’s one as well.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We can do that. I think I'll be able to pop around after the food of you want?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That would be good, you had said already. I haven’t planned dinner for you! I can get something?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh don't worry, I'll be full of food\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I still have no idea what to do for dinner tomorrow. Thoughts?\\
Spaghetti carbonara?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have a look at kia picanto car as well as see what you think\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You know what I'm going to say :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
But yeah, carbonara is good :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll have a look\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No idea what your going to say\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Rice :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh :face-with-tears-of-joy: can do\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Only if you fancy it too\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have fun at park run!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll eat the rice.\\
It was almost fun. More of a walk jog with Toria. Probably a sensible intro back to running. Defo could have run faster but heart rate was maxed.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh glad it was good. How did Toria find it?\\
Did you stay for coffee?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: She found it a bit tough but got it done. She can run better than she thinks she can.\\
Yeah, at Starbucks now. Got roped into helping Toria move a worktop because she can’t lift it :man-facepalming:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: How far how you got through the list of moving ?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: PR is tough, especially for first times.\\
Enjoy the coffee. Did many people turn up?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well, I had breakfast and a nap. Just off to shower now\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was super muddy. Nearly 400 I think.\\
Well done. Aiming for another nap later?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: At Starbucks?? :face-with-tears-of-joy: Sorry I meant Pommers\\
Nooo, I won't have time\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh yeah. 8 ish.\\
Patri is here and Jenny was here. Are you seeing them later?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No, it's the other lot. I'll explain one of these days\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok. Maybe that needs to be sooner rather than later so that I don’t say something silly to people by mistake\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah okay, will do\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did you say something today?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No, I wasn’t on their table but I’d immediately thought not to say anything unless prompted\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: One of my many skills is putting my foot in it using the least number of words possible.\\
I have an example story from a work party I can share later\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha okay. Can't wait to hear it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Guess you’re just about ready to leave. Hope you have a nice time. Seems like the day has got nicer.\\
Let me know what time you might be coming over.\\Obviously if your need feeling it then let me know and I’ll see you tomorrow.\\Completed my strong man duty.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm leaving in about half an hour.\\
Yea, it looks lovely and sunny. Is it cold?\\I'll let you know how I am when we're leaving\\Ah well done! Big strong man :flexed-biceps:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s not super warm. Probably will want a jacket but as you run cold maybe a whole snow suit?\\
Have you dressed up? Bet you look amazing!\\Have fun\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I'm definitely taking a coat :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Not really dressed up. Wearing the same black jeans and shirt I wore to the theatre when I came to pick you up at Matt's?\\Thank you. What is your plan?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: So I was right then. Amazing!\\
Currently about to play games then might go crazy and have a bath. Depend on times might try and sort some masters applications\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Then I might get to see this women I like a crazy amount\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that's a good plan\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I hope it works out for you :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Me to\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just finished here. Shall I stop by?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sure, eta?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 20mins?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep great\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Nice seeing you tonight. Enjoy shopping x x x x\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Loved seeing you tonight too x x x x\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Of pottering was a sport I'd be a bloody champion. Just finished in Sainsbury's. Don't let me go again :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So you pottered around Sainsburys?\\
How much unnecessary stuff did you buy?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I can only imagine how badly a conversation would go if I’m trying to stop you doing something\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I pottered extensively.... Not much, just two plants... Everything is nectar card price food stuffs\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
I take constructive feedback on board\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: 2 MORE plants :face-with-tears-of-joy: at least let spud break the ones from the other week first.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But one of the ones from the other week has to go live at your place so I just replaced it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So one new plant for him to eat\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And I discovered that orchids are not toxic :beaming-face-with-smiling-eyes: and I always wanted one\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Really I thought orchids were mega bad but maybe I’m thinking Lilly’s\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Lilys are mega mega bad\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So did you buy an orchid or is it just on the list\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I did buy it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Itty bitty one\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :see-no-evil-monkey:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: This is why you need more shelves\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I dooooooo\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: For books and planta\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Plants\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That fern will not survive the cat\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Shhhhhgg\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Im a realist\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes you are\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That grows up massive!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: My cousin has one\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Large adjacent\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Massive\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not massive. Great Danes are massive.\\
These aren’t even as big as my last dog\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What breed is it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Bernese Mountain dog\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Massive\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Large\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And the grooming bill :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: They wouldn’t be heavier than a person\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: They just shed on the floor\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That is not a dog, that's a bear\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: There was only one point where Shadow weight more than my sister in law\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Apparently they don't have a very long lifespan\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The curse of over medium dogs\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: My cousin only had his like 6 years or so\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Heart gives out\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh poor babies\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Never expected Shadow to hit 12\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I can't even think about dealing with that. Already have hard time thinking spud will be 4 in the summer\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Lockdown cat.\\
It’s the sad part of pet ownership that you sign up for\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: He wasn't a lockdown cat. I got him after\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Lockdown age\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah. But was born on the street\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: My poor homeless knobhead he is\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Now he’s a freeloading house cat\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Wouldn't have him any other way :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That how they get you :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah well :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you sure you're alright for 9 tomorrow? We can do later\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: We can do later. When?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No I mean when do you want to come? I'm good whenever\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How about I go for being at Mc Donald’s for 9? Then come to you after that.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sounds good :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm pottering my way to bed :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How much pottering can possible be done in one evening?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Apparently loads\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Late bed time for you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I did the bins and dishes tbh\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I knooow\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Urgh, that’s why I just close the kitchen door :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Then morning Paul gets annoyed at last Paul\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Past\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I like to do a closing shift of the flat before I go to bed\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Definitely the better way\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Looking forward to tomorrow.\\
Hope you sleep better than night.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Me too. Can't wait to spend some proper time with you\\

Quick question - did you say you had that laser measuring thingy?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have a laser measure thingy\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Could you bring it?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah and a normal tape measure?\\
What are we measuring\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've got tape measure.\\
Bath panel and screen. And windows :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh, laser is good for windows\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you got a list of what we are looking for today?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We can make one together?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, just I might not know all the things.\\
Taps, screens, blinds, shower\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But you might know something I don't remember :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Leaving for Mc d’s\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yay!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am up and not crying!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done. Feeling better from the nap?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It was nice to have a rest :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What have you been up to?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Washing up and games\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to quickly potter, shower and come over?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep, let me know when\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Will do\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Can I come in cosies?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: If you like.\\
I wasn’t expecting a ball gown\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll be in joggers\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Perfect\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I might have little somethin' somethin' extra on\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh :eyes::eyes:\\
That is unexpected\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :smiling-face-with-halo:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to feed the cat and than can come?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok,\\
I just didn’t think you were feeling up to stuff this weekend.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :woman-shrugging-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't start cooking :face-blowing-a-kiss:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Too early for dinner :winking-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Leaving in 5\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm having to defog the car :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm home x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done. Did the roadworks get in the way?\\
I really enjoyed today x x x\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No, nothing was happening.\\
Me too. I really had a brilliant day. Thank you x x x x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I like helping.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And I appreciate you helping\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also, I love my cosy outfit so so much. Thank you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m pleased. It looks amazing do I’m glad it also comfy\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I made my sleepy time tea\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Now to not get distracted\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Need to drink it first\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Check out this BILLY from IKEA\\
Here's a little more information:\\Bookcase, black-blue, 80x28x202 cm\\\url{https://ingka.page.link/d8n2c4jqCr8rUZ7LA}\\They finally relaunched dark billy\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s a cool colour. Would match the sofa :face-with-tears-of-joy:.\\
They seem to be sold out\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah but estimated back next week\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Do they have other units in the colour? <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No they don't :disappointed-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just having a look. But they have everything in black\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s something then.\\
Didn’t you decide on a bunch of units if they have black back in stock?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes but they don't have those. I think they tweaked the billy so they are slightly different\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :man-facepalming:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah. I'm just having a look\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Check out this BESTÅ from IKEA\\
Here's a little more information:\\TV bench with doors, black-brown\/Lappviken\/Stubbarp black-brown, 120x42x48 cm\\\url{https://ingka.page.link/LGkAoLrP1peD9b1D9}\\This as a TV bench and then a couple billys either side?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That looks cleaner than the kallax we found. Billy either side would work. The  you still have space for a couple of shelves or a 1x4 Kalax on the wall above the TV.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I've got the eket shelves that are next to your side of the bed\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They could go on the wall\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That all works. 3 ikea units then. Get rid of futon and the current TV unit.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup. Good plan\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'd still want to go in for a potter :beaming-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00009423-GIF-2024-02-11-21-12-05.mp4>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, we can go for a potter but those items would need to be delivered anyway\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't remind me. It's definitely not going to be straight away I guess\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes they will. My car wouldn't fit it either\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The billy wouldn’t even fit in my parents car\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Could you get them ordered this week? We could build them at the weekend\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh. Will need to look at finances\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: First, you said not until after Wednesday.\\
Is that with doors.\\That might mean it’s end of life.\\Will have to see if it will fit my parents car\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes I wanted one with doors to hide nonsense :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Are they at least available in the “local” store\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes they are\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Confusing and good\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I do see that you got distracted :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am in bed though. Still drinking tea\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is a lot of tea or a lot of being distracted from tea\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Slow drinker\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 140x78\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sounds like that will fit\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Bath panel is highest priority\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Looking now\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: image omitted\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Aren’t they all plastic?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: These ones are mdf\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Apart from the MDF ones :man-facepalming:\\
MDF and water do not mix and yours needs to be cut to make it fit\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: True\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Shall I go for the storage one?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Might as well give it a try. Could be a good place for bathroom cleaning stuff.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's what I was thinking\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: More functionality that what you have now\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh it's 169\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Back to a normal one\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not worth that much\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No no, I mean size 169cm\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That should fit then and then might not need tweaking\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We measured at 170\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was just slightly less than 170 I thought\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And you can see that your panel had to be cut and if all panels are 170 then 1cm will be ok\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. I'll order tomorrow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Right. I'm going to bed, otherwise I'll spend the night looking at things :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Thank you for always helping me :smiling-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: We didn’t check height but I’m guessing this is standard height.\\
We can definitely make that panel fit.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night, sleep well and I'll see you in the morning x x x x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: If the panel doesn’t immediately fit it will be worth us doing it rather than paying Dave. Just a thought.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night x x x x x\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: Doh, time for some pottering?\\
Or you could fully read everything for Wednesday and keg the brain work on it while you big sofa, come back and hit it.\\Nap first maybe?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to eat something, nap and then sofa. Then sit down and knock this out.\\
Have you finished yet?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just got home.\\
Good plan. Once you’ll get started you’ll smash it out.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What's your plan for today?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Want to get some work done. Send out some emails to a couple of universities.\\
That will all probably take all day. Need to do washing as well.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's a good plan\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just sorting the sofa. They'll run the credit check so should know in 24hrs. Why am I always scared about failing credit checks :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Credit checks are always a bit odd. It’s somehow like taking a test you can’t control. No doubt it will be fine.\\
There is a site you can sign up for to check and look at your credit. I think it’s one of those adult things your meant to do much more often than I do.\\How do you feel about it now it’s done?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh it's already been approved by the time I drove home :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Yeah it was comfy sitting on it for longer. I can fold away as usual. Got a protection on it too so if anything happens (even cat) they'll repair or replace it. But got it basically for free as she discounted the delivery.\\Oh btw, ran into Stuart there\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s good.\\
Stuart buying sofas as well then?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: When is it being delivered?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: He was just looking around\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Mid way through march but they'll contact me to arrange the delivery\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: March! Flipping heck. Everything takes ages.\\
At least the floor should be done by then and the bathroom.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's like 4 weeks. Better than the 98 days for a new one. And apparently this one has only been in the showroom for about 2 months\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: When it come to sorting delivery I’m happy to help.\\
No doubt it will be some vague delivery time while you’re at work.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you so much. She did say they do weekends too so we'll see what they come up with\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Stuart told me that he was teasing you in Starbucks on Saturday :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’d imagine a weekend is extra :money-bag: easy for me to be at or get to your place during a weekday.\\
I mean I spoke to Stuart :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\He said he was going to tell you about Toria. If that’s the bit he meant.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, yes that's what he said :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: He does like to mix it up. All in good humor.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes yes\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I was about to say something stupid like who would bring their side piece to a place where people know you and your partner but then I can well imagine it would happen because people are stupid.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah, yea\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Even worse. If you (some hypothetical person) were having an affair. Why would you show Stuart. He’d obviously tell everyone :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh god he would. The first person would the person concerned\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep, I mean if you wanted them to find out then that would be the way to go.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to rest for half an hour and then work\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Lunch?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not yet\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was more. Nap, lunch the work.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yes :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your work going?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s going. This is a long chapter but this one should be good.\\
Baryons in the dark-matter halos.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well done!\\
I wish I knew what that meant\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Some of it does sound stupid and scientist are sneaky. They use other words for words we already have.\\
Baryons is just all matter, that isn’t dark or photons. But photons don’t have mass so makes sense they are not included.\\Why they don’t just say matter or visible matter I have no idea\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Unfortunately I can't help with this :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The whole dark matter dark energy thing still feels like we are missing something very important.\\
None of the maths or visible observations work without it but we can’t prove it exists but it just exist otherwise everything breaks but why can’t we find it then.\\Still seems very zebra over horses for when you hear hooves coming towards you.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's really interesting what you get up to with your studies\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Someone is drilling again. I'm going to lose my mind\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Do what they do on the gym. Have the music soooo loud that you can’t hear anything anymore\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Also, of course they are drilling. You are about to nap.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly. I did ask the girl to turn it down when I was going upstairs so hopefully that helped\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Plus, I had a really good time with you yesterday.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: They did. A bit\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Me tooo\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I do love spending time with you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well I like helping and for some reason I seem to like helping others with DIY project more than projects in my own house.\\
I obviously like what we did in the evening but I also really enjoyed after. Just laying.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well it was a circus with the doors going constantly, drilling, cleaners everything. Feel worse now than I did before the nap. I've sat down but struggling to get going\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I like you helping :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
It's was all fantastic. I really enjoyed myself, and enjoyed just being there with you\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hopefully they are finished now.\\
Is it worth reading it all and going outside for a quick walk. To try and reset?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've got the first draft done.\\
Which way shall I go with the PPT? Design\/blank\/??\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done. I think a bit of a design is good. Blank always looks a bit odd IMO\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Can I send it to you?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've sent it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Looking now\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m guessing you’re not going to read the flash cards verbatim?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm not going to read them. I'll try to remember\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Slide 8. I am personally not a fan of slides that reveal themselves while you talk. Mainly because the presenter generally forgets to advance or advances to far. If you wanted to be fancy you could delay them showing in order once the slide is active\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think the last should should include a statement about asking for question \/ now I’ll take questions.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And appart from that? Content?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Content looks good. I do know if you need a "scene" setting slide at the beginning after the title screen. Like a contents list of what you are about to talk about without actually talking about it. That way you can setup the audience for what you are about to talk about and that you will be taking questions at the end\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: My main thought with the Content page would be to setup your expectation and that questions are at the end.\\
In the notes for Slide 1 you have "secondary teacher" Do you say that or secondary school teacher. Seems super picky of me but secondary teacher could be seen as less than but secondary school teacher is very clear\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I've sent you a version I have just had a play around with just to see what you think. Even less slides\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just had a look.\\
I'm not why it is but I prefer I slide per thing as it helps my brain move on\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I like the colours. I'll have a proper look after my counselling session\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Is your tutorial now?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just started\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope it's good\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Me too.\\
Good luck with your session.\\My whole thing with my version was to sort of show off some more PPT skills and keep the past stuff on screen for people if they aren’t paying attention.\\Really I was playing with the smartArt.\\I had a look at their site. There main colours seem to be red and blue. Couldn’t find any corporate colour guides though.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: If it wasn’t clear on the PPT I added animation. So that slide doesn’t appear all at once.\\
Which I know goes against what I said early but think this is a different scenario\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to have a look now :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How are you doing?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not sure about either presentation :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: As in which one is better\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Are you spiralling between the 2?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeh\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What makes you unsure about my version? Don’t like the transitions\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I was really bothered about the contents bubble's picture not matching what it's representing\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: There aren’t a huge number of option on the smart art.\\
What about a 3rd version which is your one but with their red and blue\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm doing flashcards now so will think about it after\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was tutorial?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was ok. The presenter was a lip smacker :man-facepalming:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ewwww\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Flashcards done. Now to try to get it all into my head\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done. That’s huge. :star:\\
You can rest now and look again tomorrow\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Still need to do company research for the interview\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That can be an hour tomorrow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You're right\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was the rest of your evening?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Tutorial was meh but that’s because I actually knew what he was talking about. So that’s actually nice.\\
Now playing games. Which are not going well. We both seem to be playing shit today.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Paired!!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope the games got a bit better. I'm in bed now hoping for some sleep.\\
Night night, sleep well x x x x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night x x x x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You haven’t done it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I just realised I closed it before sending it through :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\section*{Tuesday $13\textsuperscript{th}$}
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00009587-GIF-2024-02-13-06-15-47.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning!\\
You did beat me in being up early. How was spin? How does everything feel down there?\\I did wake up at one point again but had a long sleep x x x x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Wow, much longer sleep. Not much deep.\\
You know you are going to have to try what we know clearly helps with your sleep.\\Spin was BRUTAL. Joseph even said it was peony the hardest class he has done. Watt test at the end which my cheat shoes helped me win.\\Currently downstairs feels ok or at least the same. A very dull ache every now and then and the odd weirdness but it’s like a 10th of the pain I did to my butt in the gym on Friday.\\Looks like Monday morning spin is out for a while which is a pain. Will gym and maybe run instead next week.\\I’m about to go to M\&S for tonight and tomorrow’s food.\\I’m going over to my brothers for 4 today and should be home 5:30. I can let you know and you can come over for pancakes (which most people forgot about in so  today)\\Do you need to pick anything up for your pancakes?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh well done on going and smashing it! Hopefully there won't be any delayed pain.\\
Why is Monday spin out?\\Oki. Let me know. We've got the vet at 11.30 and will try to do more prep around it.\\Don't worry. I'll pick bits up on my way. Still don't know what I fancy :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Joseph is teach pirates now so dropped Monday.\\
Watch says 4 days recovery :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\Are you done with your presentation or is there more to do?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: He teaches pirates?\\
Haha, you'd better take that suggestion :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\I think I'm done. Learn it and company research\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Pilates. I call it pirates.\\
4 days! I got stuff to do.\\That’s great. Pressure off.\\I personally wouldn’t go mental on the company research beyond seeing what their website says they do.\\Do you need anything printed out?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Could print the PPT for everyone just in case there is a tech issue at their end.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Food acquired. Had to tweak it a bit based on what they had but should be good and I’ve got dinner for Friday as well.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I could! I do have a printer.\\
I think I'm going to go with mine. It just worked best for my brain when I ran through both of them\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh thank you. You didn't need to cover all the dinners :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: I'll cook\/sort dinner out next week\\
What did you get?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I was offering to print it if you need.\\
No issue over which one. You need to be comfortable with it. I was just playing around.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Won’t you just have to see.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh noooo. I'm not surprise type of person :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yum yum\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So home made spaghetti carbonara for Friday.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s a no alcohol fizz for tomorrow to try out if you fancy.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: I was planning on bringing some too!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh cool. We can pick one and save the other for Friday\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Brill idea!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good luck with the vet.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you. Need to try to get the goblin in the box in 20 mins\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just remember. Your bigger than he is :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes but he has murder mittens which are especially juicy at the moment\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oven gloves\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't have those :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Attack with towel\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll just lift him in hopefully\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Took 3 tries. The most pathetic screams the whole way there and just been taken away for pedicure\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think they would make less noise being slowly murdered\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: He is a bit of a drama queen when it comes to vets\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I got super lucky with mine. Shadow LOVED the vets and would try to get everywhere to see people. Despite 2 shocking operations. I think he is still on there video wall. They both hated claws though. Just normal I think\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Could hear him through two doors\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Some masters stuff done :face-screaming-in-fear:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well done! We're just out\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We're home from the vets munching on tuna steak.\\
You should have seen him hugging me and trying to climb into my arms. He's a proper little drama queen\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did you do applications or enquiry emails?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Aww, very traumatic for the potato. He doesn’t go outside so must be quite a lot for him.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yes :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
One application and some enquiries\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh well done! Where did you apply?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes. But the vet was brilliant. Even put the worming treatment on for us\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The Liverpool one. Was relatively easy compared to some\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Brill. How many more to go?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: At least 2 maybe 3. Waiting on email replies\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good! How are you feeling about it all?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: All a bit meh at the moment. Need more info which I don’t have so not much to think about now until I get more info.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Fair enough. Here to talk anything through when you need\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thank you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you got your wave number for the winter run? Was just looking at travel. Should be easy enough\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes yellow. You?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What were you thinking travel wise?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I'm grey. so, one before you.\\
Drive to West Ruislip and get the tube in, change at oxford circus\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: 35 min car ride\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Perfect. Can I come with you?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: that was my plan\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just checking :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: probably picking Cally up as well\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Calling shotgun\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: yeah, good call\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: what was you max car price £4k?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But if I don't need to spend that much that would be brill\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: polo on the list or no \url{https://www.autotrader.co.uk/car-details/202402026163683}\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: This looks pretty good \url{https://www.autotrader.co.uk/car-details/202312305136932}\\
Typical I cannot find any place that has more than one car to look at\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No polos please\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's as old as mine. I'd like something post 2012 I think\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: This place has 3 cars you might like \url{https://www.firstchoiceslough.co.uk/} or at least a place to physically see multiple cars\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We can definitely go have a look there. Which ones did you mean?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I can show you later if you like but there is at least one 500, a ka and an i10 I think.\\
The 500 looks the best (as a car) but it could be  good starting point so you can see stuff all at once.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki.\\
Yea that's a good plan :smiling-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Pass on my happy birthday wishes\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Obviously don’t have to buy one from there but I have zero issues wasting a car dealers time.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Let me know when you're on your way back :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: On my way home now. So come over whenever you’re ready.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm just popping into Morrisons. Will be with you in a bit\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Checking you made it home?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just parked. The road was closed by morissons\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :man-facepalming:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ended up doing an extra round around the roundabout and going through frogmore\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You must be all set now?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I haven't done anything\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm just going to go to bed\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Correct plan because you’re all ready. Switch the brain off. You will do great.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I keep telling you, and I will keep telling you. I appreciate you so much :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: In bed now. Let's hope for a solid night sleep.\\
Night night, sleep well. Big hugs, really like you x x x x x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just relax. You’ve got this.\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The chicken always delivers <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Try and enjoy it.\\
You know you can do the job, you’ve done the prep. Presentation is ready to go. The rest is talking.\\They need to impress you enough to take the job.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00009687-GIF-2024-02-14-08-08-32.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Deep breaths\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yes, breathing is good\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Dare I ask how you slept?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also a weird win this morning. Just getting dressed and pulled out work trousers still with tags on because I bought them without trying them on and they didn't fit.\\
They fit like a glove now\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Nice, that is a win.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Much better sleep than I thought\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I thought I'd be up most of the night\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm thinking about taking some Pre-workout before I leave :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: If you think it will help but could that make you crash later in the interview?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's what I'm not sure about\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Look at you looking all business and shit.\\
And cute :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I like that a lot\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: In an attempt to try and calm yourself. Remember this is just an interview with people.\\
You can do the work.\\You’d be amazing at doing the work.\\They also need to impress you and see how amazing you are.\\Doing the interview doesn’t yet change anything.\\You’re not letting anyone down or breaking any promises by doing an interview. I know you care a lot about your friends at school and there will be adjustment for them but if they aren’t over the moon excited for you then that would be bad and sad.\\Change is scary but this is an interview. Nothing has changed yet and still nothing will change after the interview.\\This could be the start of something exciting, so try and enjoy it and have fun with it.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :smiling-face-with-hearts::smiling-face-with-hearts::smiling-face-with-hearts::smiling-face-with-hearts::smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You're the best, you know that right?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :grimacing-face:\\
I know I’m not always quick to say the right thing or say the right things at all but I sometimes have my moments.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I can imagine you making that face :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s an accurate emoji\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Right I have the slides, usb, and a notebook. Anything else?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Drink?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: A stable sub 100 heart rate\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 111 at the moment :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Your notebook has your questions?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What questions?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Your questions to them.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've already asked so many during the last time :grimacing-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have a couple.\\
What concerns do you have at the moment that would stop me getting the role?\\	extrm	extrm	extrm	extrm	extrm a must to ask. Scary but basically gives you a chance to counter their concerns. If they don’t have any then you know you have the job.\\When can I expect to hear from you on next steps?\\Does the company have any special holidays.\\What does the company do for team building.\\What does a typical day \/ week look like?\\What do people like about working here?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You might already have asked and have answers but with a different audience might be good to repeat.\\
Good to ask them stuff as people should like talking about what they do and how the company is.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You might get a different reaction face to face\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you :purple-heart:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: If you only ask one question. Make it the concerns one.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: My name wasn't on the gate.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Really hope this isn't a sign\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I doubt it. Happens all the time.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Got a badge though so all good\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Out for a quick break\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: In tray exercise 1hr45\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just done the presentation\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Breath\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Next interview with 2 completely new people\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How was the exercise?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I didn't prepare for two completely new people\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And the whole team was iny presentation\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well that’s done now, which is good.\\
New people for the interview doesn’t change anything.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Didn't finish it all. Apparently not supposed to but did like 90\%\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They are so lovely. I want this\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: New people in the interview gives you the chance to ask questions and see what different (if any) answers you get.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How are you?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You still got this.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m fine. Crap run, sat. Now trying to do some work\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But at least you went\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Right I'll be going back in\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Send positive thoughts\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You’ll smash it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sending…..\\
X x x x x x\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: X x x x x x\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm out\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yay, how you doing?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Absolutely shattered but it was great\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: So hungry. Didn't have lunch\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I could have had it but was too nervous\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Grab food and a nap?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What time am I coming to yours?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: When you say. I’m guessing a good few hours given food and nap requirements\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think I'm too wired for nap. Maybe 6?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That works.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You should try and nap.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: When do you find out?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Either today or tomorrow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Took me literal 10 mins to get home :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s a fast trip. Much better than 45 minutes.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Isn't it just\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I have nothing to eat :disappointed-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I thought you’d have gone somewhere in the way home\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Porridge?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nah\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Soup\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Had that for breakfast\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Something in a sandwich\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll figure something out. Don't want anything massive as STEAK :beaming-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Can't you tell I'm looking forward\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Cheese roll and the biscuits that got opened.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: To seeing you first and foremost\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I can. :cut-of-meat:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you get your winter run number?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't think so\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haven't checked\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Awwww, she's so cute\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Please say thank you from me\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep, you’re going to be knackered.\\
Did they ask you. “Are you calm under pressure”\\“Absolutely calm under pressure.”\\Meanwhile watch beeping high heart rate alerts :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah, no they didn't\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You might sleep well later.\\
That is a very high consistent rate\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: At least I definitely smashed that :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Certainly will have hit workout targets for the week. Had it come down now?\\
Your body has a very obvious and direct connection of brain stress to body actions.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, 88 now\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How’s the stress \/ anxiety now? <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Coming down and starting to feel the knackerdness\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Adrenaline will no doubt be wearing off\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Definitely is\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm folded like a cinnamon roll\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00009801-GIF-2024-02-14-15-33-42.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Might do a little one\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sounds painful\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But what if they caaaaaaaallll\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Then you wake up. Count to 10 and answer\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Will they call or email?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You and your logic :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Or you miss the call and phone back or they leave a message etc. basically nothing bad happens\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm in bed\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I got whole 15mins\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: that has to be better than zero?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Didn't make me feel super good\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to take a shower and then potter to get ready\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: ahh, that's what happens when I nap\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: ok. Eta? ish?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 6... Ish\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Probably like 6.15\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: 6:30. got it :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully before\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't want to eat at 9 :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :face-with-tears-of-joy:, dinner should be 30 mins to cook. I think\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Eh knowing us\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am actually ready and can leave in 5 if that's okay?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah that works\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. See you in 15\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Home!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ended up going up hughenden road and down pastures\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is probably the shortest way\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Great seeing you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Now you can potter off to bed\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I loved spending time with you. As always. And thank you again for dinner, it was lovely\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hopefully you get some good news soon tomorrow.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Steph just rescheduled\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: For when?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Maybe a bit of luck\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Next week\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Tell the potato :potato: tomorrow is a no alarm day\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm sure he'll listen. He was very smug staying in bed while I got up today\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: He might listen. You never know.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha he might\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: At least tomorrow can be a proper day for yourself\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, I'll have an easy morning and then tackle everything\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m going to the gym again Friday morning with Toria if you want to join.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Actually yes, I was planning on going so that will be nice\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m assuming you’re asleep.\\
\section*{Thursday $15\textsuperscript{th}$}
Just about to go myself.\\Night x x x x x x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00009850-GIF-2024-02-15-06-08-22.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning X X X X x\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm so sorry I didn't text last night. I completely crashed with the light on and phone in hand :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, I thought that might have happened. I did see your whole brain suddenly switch off at about 9pm\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly I don't even know what happened. But I feel bad I didn't manage to text you before :pensive-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Is it spin this morning?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Don’t feel bad.\\
Yeah just spin. Only 30mins today but it normally suitable hurts\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Your up early though\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah just suddenly woke up wide awake. Potato is still fast sleep so it wasn't him\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How are you feeling this morning? Other than anxious about the job.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just that.\\
I think my body just gave up last night so it feels like I slept solid. I'm going to have an easy morning.\\How was spin?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s good. What the sleep chart say?\\
Spin was its usual brutalness. Only 4 of us. Might have finally convinced a couple of people to get shoes.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It always sounds brutal :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Do you definitely need the shoes?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not quite as good of numbers as I might have guessed but maybe you moved less \/ woke up less from being exhausted.\\
No point a spin class being easy. You don’t need shoes but they make it better. Means you can work harder.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah, I think every time I was this exhausted where I crashed the sleep wasn't *the best.\\
I've only ever done one spin class and I almost threw up :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: The first spin class is the worst. You have to get past the first 4.\\
It’s much better than running.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Maybe I'll try it out again\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s a class where you only really work as hard as you like. Everyone will do different levels based on their ability\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Maybe when titans starts running them\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Shower is fixed :grinning-face:\\
I’m guessing no news yet? My guess will be before lunch. Hopefully\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Eey well done! I had a nap.\\
No news yet\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well, all that sleeping would be tiring :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You know I have to :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Whoop\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :eyes::eyes::eyes::eyes::eyes::eyes::eyes::eyes::eyes::eyes::eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yay\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Unless it's a lowball one\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It might be.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They need to call!!!!!!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't know how to negotiate\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You’d need to do some quick math and see what the limit is.\\
What the growth potential might be. If there could be a bump after 3\/6\/12 months or if it’s X now it could just be an inflation one next year.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Don’t tell them that.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I won't\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I can't go below 45\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just to ask.\\
You would walk away if it’s 44\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It is a shame they haven’t sent through the offer.\\
Get the call arranged. Speak to them. Find out what it is and why it is what it is and what progress can be expected in the short and long term and they simply ask how long can you think about it for.\\Then we can talk about it (if you like).\\Importantly - well done because they want to offer you the job.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've sent an email back saying I am available now and all afternoon and asking when works best\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Make sure you have pen and paper for when they call.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good point\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just write it all down.\\
Don’t make any definitive statements.\\You’ll need to ask about private medical \/ pension and any other extra’s and if those extra are on top of it if they come out of the salary.\\£1k might be replaced somewhere with benefits that can be used. As an example.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 45 would still be about 350 less a month\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It would be fairly normal to have a probation rate that would then go up after 3 months.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Does that take into account the difference in pension contributions?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I threw it into the salary calculator\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: There will be an obvious saving on petrol\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: There is private health, can pay extra for dental\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Employee assistance program\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The healthy living 350 a year\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And potential bonus\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That would pay for titans\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Definitely\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You need to find out more about any bonuses.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: As part of the call\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You on 50 at the moment?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 51\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Extra responsibility\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The comparison to do will be your current take home vs new take home. Once you know then compare that to cost differences to work out actual loss\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m guess you’d save £100-£150 on fuel plus save £30 on the gym. So that £350 difference is halved\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: This bit of the job process is all logic. Not emotion.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm back in anxiety alley :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: She needs to reply!!!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Breath.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've been deep cleaning the kitchen\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You need information first. Then choices can be made\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Get your desk setup with paper and questions (pension, bonus, pay reviews, extra’s)\\
What your current take home is so they know how keen you are as you’re willing to drop.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Then you just chat and find out.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You’ve already made it clear (I think) that your coming from 50 down to 45\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Anything else I should ask\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Starting salary vs passing probation\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: They might have to send through the benefits as it could be a long list of stuff to look through.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll ask for her to send the offer through after the call\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know when I joined CPS I got them to agree a bigger bump after passing probation.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm really worried they will want to do references before I have a chance to speak to anyone\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Talk about start dates.\\
They won’t do references until you’ve accepted the job\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Pretty common that your new company won’t ask your current company for references until after you have told the current company\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll be able to talk to everyone on Monday\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Shitting hell this is happening\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’d be suprised if they bring it up but you could add that to your list.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Exciting isn’t it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Terrifying at this precise moment :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: On this call don’t commit positively or negatively to anything.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How do I do that?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm a shit corporate girlie :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Don’t tell them that either :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: She still hasn't replied!!!!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just talk. Find out the offer, ask questions and get it all down. Then ask when they need to know by and that you will let them know.\\
Unless of course the offer is everything you want. But still ask for it all in writing and what the formal acceptance process is\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Probably took lunch\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's 3 o'clock there\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Or a meeting. Could be anything\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know I know\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Breath\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But like :grimacing-face::grimacing-face::grimacing-face::grimacing-face::grimacing-face::grimacing-face::grimacing-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Does the pay come with stock?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: \url{https://www.milkround.com/advice/how-to-negotiate-salary-in-the-uk}\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: \url{https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/pay-salary/how-to-negotiate-salary}\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Omg she needs to call now\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is what you expected\\
Good luck.\\Your amazing\\Breath.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Now I'm worried that she didn't like my email :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I was to the point\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :man-facepalming: rule 2\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You deleted this message.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: She doesn't know about the rule\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Shows excitement\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But also she's German\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Emails are just communication tools for sending facts\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But she finishes work in 1.5hra\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: As she hasn’t replied or phoned you can assume she is in a meeting that will end at half past or top of the hour\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 8 mins\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Until she calls?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yay,\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well 5 now. She's calling at 2.30\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Got a drink.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Used the loo.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Headphones for hand free, if you like.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't have that\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: <attached: 00009974-GIF-2024-02-15-14-26-55.mp4>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00009975-GIF-2024-02-15-14-27-20.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Can I call?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Voice call, 38 min\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00009979-GIF-2024-02-15-15-13-39.mp4>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Brilliant.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's going to be hard not to say anything during lunch tomorrow\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It will be but better not to until it’s all super sorted\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Of course\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s a strange space to be in keeping a secret about work from work people\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: From friends <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: yes, but if you tell them they will tell work. So its about controlling the information flow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I knooooow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I won't tell them\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Only one person knows I've been looking\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Car is empty. Will get it cleaned tomorrow morning\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done. I wouldn’t go super mental on getting it clean.\\
Find anything exciting?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just so much crap\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's a state so I'll just take it to a car wash\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The one by the Tesco express near Matts house is ok\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I usually go to the Morrisons hand one\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: that's not mc Donalds :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Is that the waterless one?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Tomorrow! I'm not sure we have enought time between lunch and the gym to go to the car dealer so I was thinking after your done with lunch we can go to the first place inn slough and at least you can see the cars\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that's coming once I'm done with everything\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, I was thinking about going after lunch\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: There's couple of bigger places in Slough no?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: does mean you can gym shower nap all in the morning\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: a dealer in slough has at least 3 cars to look at\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Car Giant didn't have any cars less than £6k\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know. But there might be another one we could look at?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The dealer in slough has sold at least 2 of the cars I thought we would look at\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: This is the search I am using \url{https://www.autotrader.co.uk/car-search?exclude-writeoff-categories=on&fuel-type=Petrol&maximum-badge-engine-size=1.6&maximum-mileage=80000&minimum-badge-engine-size=1.2&page=1&postcode=HP13%205ER&price-from=2000&price-to=4000&radius=15&seller-type=trade&sort=distance&year-from=2012}\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yeah I did look at that dealer before\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The great missenden one\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Then there are these I have pulled from that search\\
\url{https://www.autotrader.co.uk/car-details/202401316084277}\\\url{https://www.autotrader.co.uk/car-details/202402046222785}\\\url{https://www.autotrader.co.uk/car-details/202401045256360}\\\url{https://www.autotrader.co.uk/car-details/202402136534764}\\\url{https://www.autotrader.co.uk/car-details/202402146577445}\\\url{https://www.autotrader.co.uk/car-details/202309262396244}\\\url{https://www.autotrader.co.uk/car-details/202302224512015}\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: MAybe look at the i10 first and then the expensive 500 to see what is what\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: This seems the cheapest not shit one \url{https://www.autotrader.co.uk/car-details/202402136534764} and it isn't obvious to me what the extra grand would get you other than maybe a year newer car. So might come down to what tyres are on them etc\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I looked at that\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you, that's a really good selection\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: for the money that £3k 500 looks great\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes it does\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Bit of a triangle but maybe we try and do these 3 in this order\\
\url{https://www.autotrader.co.uk/car-details/202401316084277}\\\url{https://www.autotrader.co.uk/car-details/202402046222785}\\\url{https://www.autotrader.co.uk/car-details/202402136534764}\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sounds great! Thank you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your afternoon been? Apart from looking after me?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Looking after you :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Did a quick couple of games so that I can use the correct gun when I play games :man-facepalming:\\That’s about it.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: And looked at cars\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You are looking after me!!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Can you now use the correct gun in your game?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: In theory yes. Until they change it again.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I am flagging today.\\
I’m assuming your murder group all said good things about the new job.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes they did :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Why are you flagging\/ or how?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just about ready to fall asleep. Will go to bed once the tutorial has finished I think.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah yes, it's the late one today. Hopefully it's at least good.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hope so but we will see.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What time is lunch tomorrow?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 12.30. should be done by 2-2.30\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Are going to come to me from lunch?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m aiming for the gym at 7 btw.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes I will do\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki, I'll try my best :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: you can see the exact moment you had the call\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Literally :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: you need to find ways to calm your self. somehow :man-shrugging:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: that's a very high average for the day\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I do!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And it is!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: there is probably breathing exercises or something. I can think of something but it does require the heart rate going high first. :face-with-rolling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I would suggest a drink but that wont help. Stroking a pet is meant to help. So tell Spud he needs to step up his game\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I've been bothering him for the last two hours :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I haven't drank enough water today either\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: WHAT!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: why\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't know\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just kept myself busy\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Got a bit of a headache too\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: total mystery as to what could cause the headache :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I know exactly what it's caused by :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i have read about a something that helps with headaches\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :face-with-rolling-eyes: thought you were going to set me up\\
Putting feet in hot water is meant to help\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You've told me this every time I have a headache :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And you've said you tried it and it didn't work\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: it is meant to\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's the tutorial?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: either stand in hot water, drink water, orgasms or drugs\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: pretty good\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm doing 2 and 4\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: the guy has a stammer but that is better than the lip smacking\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh at least that!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: the most boring options :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: AND i knew the answer to a question. So that was good\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't know what it means but I'm glad tonight is helpful\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: its just a super quick reference to how a star of starting mass will die\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm in bed already. All this stress is knackering :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night, sleep well and I'll see you in the morning x x x x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think i'll be in bed soon enough\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night x x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
\section*{Friday $16\textsuperscript{th}$}
See you in the morning\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00010081-GIF-2024-02-16-06-28-57.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How did you sleep?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not a bad graph for you.\\
Mine was ok. Pretty sure I woke up in a REM cycle as was a bit confused when the alarm went off.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm always confused when I wake up :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha\\
“Urgh, not this again”\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha. Pretty much\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Happy 3 months anniversary btw.\\
Feels longer.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Happy 3 months :smiling-face:\\
Definitely feels longer, in a very good way. Can't wait to squeeze you later :face-blowing-a-kiss:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ve lost 10 minutes somewhere. So going to be a bit late to the gym.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I just got here\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you napped?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Don’t forget to reload your purse drug carrier thingy.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just woke up :pensive-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Nice.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was gym for you today?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just shit. I think I am cursed with sumo’s everytime I do them something seems to get in the way.\\
I can lift it but I think I’m still recovering downstairs or it’s just getting back into it. Maybe both. Had not quite pins and needles on the outside of both legs. Felt odd so stopped.\\Hamstring curls are the worst and I cannot count to 10 or to 4 :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\There is always next week.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It went wrong really when I saw the plan for today and thought “that looks fast and easy :man-facepalming:”\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Remember that you had a month and an actual medical procedure. It just might take a few tries to get back to normal.\\
Glad you stopped when you didn't feel right. I might go on Sunday again if you fancy coming along\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It will take a few weeks to reset. Just frustrating.\\
A solid maybe on Sunday. Might have it as my rest day and meant to be seeing Toria for coffee at some point.\\But I could do my leg session and then run Monday.\\Needs a detailed plan :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to be very frustrated tomorrow morning I feel.\\
I'm a solid maybe for Sunday too. Might want to just have an easy day before going back\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Btw, Michelle just called saying there is a good fiat 500 place on the maidenhead side of the bath road in slough\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Why are you going to be frustrated?\\
Does she have an address name or website? There is a main fiat dealer in slough where my dad got his from.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Parkrun. It will be hard\\
No :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: she just drove by it and called me\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It will.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just a case of if that dealer has any cheap enough?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah, she did say she didn't know if there was actually anything in my price range.\\
We'll do the ones you picked out and then can have this as a last resort for today if needed\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: We can. I think it already bold to try and see the 3 I’ve picked.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes I know\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We'll hopefully make it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The cheapest car they have is £11k\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh god\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah let's not go there :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I haven't had a chance to look at the insurance\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just looking at this for the 3 cars \url{https://www.moneysupermarket.com/car-insurance/car-insurance-group-checker-tool/}\\
All about the same. The i10 might be marginally cheaper but only by a few quid <This message was edited>\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What insurance group are they in?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i10 was 12 and the 500's were 5 and 6\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm running late. Haven't even dressed yet\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: are you just walking around naked?\\
When are you meeting?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: it's too cold for that.\\
12.30 but need to get the car washed\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: could always forgo the car wash\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's disgusting\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I didn't make it to the car wash. Will see when we finish with lunch\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just finished lunch\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Shall I go get the car washed or nah?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think nah. Unlikely you'll buy a car unless the last one is amazing and a dealer would wash a car anyway\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: so you on route to me now?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Walking to the car park and then straight to you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: ok, see you in 10-15. I'll phone about the i10\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Here\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Come inside\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you get home ok?\\
Not too much reckless abandon shopping?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just in aldi. Apparently 8pm on a Friday is a super popular time to shop :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I just realised I left the car slip thing at yours\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: We can sort tomorrow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: For a second I was like but I have my key with me :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I figured out how to set the radio and the screen wipes\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just got home\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is a lot of shopping\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you. For today. And every day. Honestly I am so lucky to have found you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sleepy tea time\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Absolutely. Just need to feed this shouting beast\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Aww, poor spud. Surviving only on the best cat biscuits.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And I don't mean this just because you help me with stuff. It's because you are you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I guess really it’s lucky I thought you started this whole thing and non creepily stalked you. :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Helping is what I try to do\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And you help so much you can't imagine\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But it's not just that. You are a wonderful person :red-heart:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thank you. I’m only doing what I think everyone does.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I can tell you not everyone does what you do\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Right I've pottered all the way to bed :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :face-with-tears-of-joy: pottering away. You’ll wear a hole in the floor pottering.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha. I wouldn't be surprised\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What have you been up to?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: CRAZY stuff.\\
Dinnner and Tv. Like a lunatic\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I did have a beer.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Need beer, pizza and honey when we go shopping tomorrow\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you done melatonin today?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Crazy night!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okie doke!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What's the honey for?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No because I'll need to wake up early ish.\\
I'll do tomorrow\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, it’s for something :winking-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ooooooh\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Tell me\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just to go with my skyr.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Nothing exciting\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You tease\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I thought you woke up fine from  melatonin\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I can only imagine how honey would get everywhere forever\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I do usually. Just need to run at least a little\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh god, yeah it's not a bedroom thing\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Btw I need to relearn how to park with the itty car :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, it should be easier\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Although I did notice you did like to be very close to the middle of the road rather than middle of the lane.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just need to get used to it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I noticed that too\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Must fit in the space a bit better at least.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And I think the doors are smaller\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I have like a meter behind me :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll get better\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just takes a little while to re adjust\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I tried the city thing as well\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think there's a difference but can't say exactly what\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It should make turning the wheel easier\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: But it should be pretty easy anyway\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It is\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's quite different to the corsa\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It should be\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you again :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Other than it has 4 wheels and drives\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m still not 100\% sure what I’m doing but you’re welcome.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Everything\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to try to turn my brain off and get some sleep\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good luck.\\
Nothing to worry about now. It’s all done. Pretty much.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just the dvla thingy tomorrow. And hopefully contract next week\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: DVLA is barely a thing and the contract is just paper work they will send through.\\
So it’s all just business as usual for next week.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I reeeeeally like you, you know\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I really like you as well.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good. Otherwise it would be awkward\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, it would be akward.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't want to make you feel more awkward than I already do :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m always feeling some sort of akward\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So it just moves around\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully I'll manage to for you not to feel awkward around me\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It will get there.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Right. Nighty night, sleep well and I'll see you in the morning x x x x x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night x x x x x x x x x x\\
See you for the *RUN*\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00010222-GIF-2024-02-16-21-48-06.mp4>\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00010224-GIF-2024-02-17-07-45-54.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x\\
I don't wannaaaaaaaaaaa\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You don’t have to but you could see what happens with a bit of running.\\
Last week I only just beat Cally who was walking.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to Jeff it but I might die :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Isn’t that what everyone thinks when they run?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Apparently not\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Btw, you know what woke me up this morning\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The cat or the alarm you forgot to turn off\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: This absolute knobhead who doesn't realise he doesn't have claws at the moment and tried to jump up on the window screen only to come crashing down because he's got nothing to hold him up there :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :face-with-tears-of-joy: knobhead.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I would say that will yeah him but I guess it won’t\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And ever since I got up he's been all snuggled up in bed sleeping\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Of course. His little stunt was just part of his morning plan.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Obviously :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What will be interesting is what is the higher heart rate. Waiting for a phone, job interview, buying a car or running. :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha. Yes we will compare\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Don’t forget new registration for the car park app\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Omg, thank you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00010246-GIF-2024-02-17-10-31-25.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just popped into wenzels\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sneaky\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Missed voice call, Tap to call back\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Could you please get me 5 bananas ? :face-with-tears-of-joy: Sorry, forgot to ask\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Done although only saw your message when I went to pay.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh thank you so much. :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to take a quick shower and come over\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sounds good. I’m just doing the same\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: FYI - I’m out of the shower AND I like your face.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I like your face too and I'm just about to leave\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also the S button is stop \& start ( that was a surprise at the lights :face-with-tears-of-joy:)\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh stop start makes sense.\\
How much fuel did you put in? Might just need the pump at a different angle. I’ve had cars that were very clicky when filling up.\\Do you normally just fill to the first click?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well it clicked at 24 ish so I just did 25 :woman-shrugging-light-skin-tone: which seemed like nothing.\\
I'm more surprised that it dropped a whole section just on the drive home. Also the water temperature went up one section\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’d have expected it to take a lot more than £25.\\
Not sure what the normal water temp range is and it was fine yesterday in the drive back?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh me too. Will see what it does on the next refill.\\
Yeah it was at the bottom of the "scale" yesterday. Just went up after I put petrol in.\\I'll get to grips with it, promise :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s just learning the new quirks of a car.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes yes :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You know I appreciate all your help with it and answering all my million questions\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I do. I have to check myself as sometimes my brain sees it first as a criticism of something I’ve done wrong :man-facepalming:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh bubs, it's never a criticism. I really do hope you will soon realise that things I tell you are not a criticism. If I need to bring something up, I will and it will be clear. No guessing games - everything on the table, remember?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know. I said I have to check myself. Just a lot of old programming.\\
Question = problem = did I fuck up.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okay. Well make sure you also check in with me if you're not sure\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I will\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I just woke up from a nap\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’d assumed you were napping.\\
Feel better for it?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Actually it was quite good. Definitely needed it.\\
What have you been up to?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sat on the sofa and watched TV. Should be drinking more water really.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Glad you’re feeling better from the nap.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ugh me too. Haven't be very good at it this week\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Let's do a challenging and get each other to drink more water!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good idea. How we going to do it?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm sure there is a better way than just shouting 'water" at each other :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That might work.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The shouting or the app?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The apps :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: shouting probably not\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: just checking\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Which one do you fancy?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00010286-GIF-2024-02-17-17-43-51.mp4>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Top one. Just installed it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Also, looks like there is a common hatch (boot) wiring issue on the 500’s. Which would explain the window demist and boot lock button.\\
I’ll chat with my brother about when he is free. Might be doable on the drive but a massive faff.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Got it! We'll start tomorrow?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
I'll go wherever it's the easiest\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep, good plan.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Will investigate. If I could get the interior panels off then should be ok. I’m pretty sure Marks about to start a couple of weeks of craziness as Vicki is going to be in London everyday.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You bathing today?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes yes, just warming the bathroom :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Isn’t that what the bath does?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Little heater. I woke up incredibly cold\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You were already cold from the market. A lot of time spent outside today.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes that might be it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: image omitted\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :fire::fire::fire::fire::fire:\\
Either on purpose or artistic bubble placement.\\For the first half second I thought you were wearing something :man-facepalming:\\Is your tattoo\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Let's go with artistic!\\
Haha, I'm always wearing my tattoos\\Just thought I'd send you something for tonight :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: But I’ve already opened it….\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: In your mind's eye :smirking-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahhh\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Enjoy your evening with the boys x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thanks they were early.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah and you didn't think they wouldn't be late :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep, I expected a text as well before they started banging on the door :man-facepalming:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've popped a melatonin and in bed with a book. Hope you're having a good time.\\
Night night x x x x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night x x x x x\\
\section*{Sunday $18\textsuperscript{th}$}
Hope you sleep well.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x\\
How was last night?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Morning x x x x x x\\
It was good. Late night in the end but fun. Very beige food :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\I might have had a power nap on the sofa for 10 minutes before going to bed :man-facepalming:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: How did you sleep?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aw I'm glad you had a good night . What did you do?\\
Haha, a power nap :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: We just sat around chatted. Mostly complete bollox like normal. A painful conversation about Matt’s mortgage options. Only because Matt kept giving the options wrong.\\
Lester and Matt both said you don’t have to wait for the contract before you resign as you have a formal offer in an email. So that’s up to you.\\Wow, you slept loads.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It does sound like a brilliant evening. I love spending time with friends just chatting about everything and nothing.\\
Haha, so I came up?\\I might give it this week and see what happens.\\It seems like I did! I did take a whole melatonin.\\Btw, today's paired. I've got a couple of questions :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: nothing bad, just want to understand better\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You came up a bit. They saw the card and spoke about the job, new car.\\
Oh no :eyes:. What questions. I’ll go and look as I thought I was super smart answering it after midnight :man-facepalming:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They saw the card? :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I hope you only say nice things about me like I have the most wonderful girlfriend, I like sooooooo much :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I mean the card was on the table and while I was sorting food they read it.\\
I only say nice things about you.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good! :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: I only say lovely things about you too\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did you want to stop by for a cuddle on your way back from seeing Toria?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah that would nice. Not sure exactly what the time would be. Somewhere around 12 but I can message when I’m leaving?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, that's not a problem, I'll be here\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you got loads of school work to do today?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh god yeah. I really don't want to do it :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I bet. Time to embrace the concept of “good enough”\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup I think I've done that when I went back in January\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't feel as guilty for not working this week as I would normally\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It was a busy week and I do need time to myself :woman-shrugging-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Exactly plus the worrying isn’t going to worry itself :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You just wait until I'm settled in my new job and the worrying will be halved :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Only halved!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I mean, we can't have everything :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm sure I'll find other things to worry about\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: True but I’d hope for more than half.\\
That’s not what’s meant to happen. You don’t need to fill the worry. Just have less. Then do other things instead\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: How do feel after running yesterday?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Things are quite a lot easier when you worry less.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I hope I will have less to worry about.\\
And I have you and your infallible logic :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Actually not too bad. Definitely feeling it in the legs. But also definitely taking a rest day from the gym\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: In theory the work worry will just drop. Yes there is work, yes there will be deadlines. But it’s corporate work. Stuff can change and move. No one is going to die.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Rest day is good. I can feel it today but that might also be booze related.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you feeling a bit fragile?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Is there a good way for me to answer this?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just honestly\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Actually feel pretty good. I know I had a few drinks but not really hung over.\\
Only had 4 or 5 beers in total\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: The IPA from Lidl was surprisingly good. Stupid strong but good\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well that's good!\\
Have you had any water yet?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh and I might of had a gin\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not yet and my phone is already moaning at me.\\
Need to move really as need a bit of food before I go out or I will be a hangry bitch\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have some water!!!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I always have a bottle on my bedside table. It really helps with having a drink right after I wake up\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup 400ml\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And coffee and breakfast\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: When did you get up! Keen\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 8?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Urgh and you’ve done so much.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You know how it is. I really need to try doing things while I have spoons :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Doesn’t the doing things use spoons though.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes but things like eating need to be done whether I have spoons or not\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: True\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, he did well to catch them\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know!\\
Love finding weird shit iny bed :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\At least they are not the live variety\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yes, you done need birds rats or mice being dragged through a cat door\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: On my way\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Heads up I look like hell :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good nap?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ended up a bit longer than anticipated.\\
Good lunch?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, only set the smoke alarm off twice this time :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
You didn’t set an alarm then. Feel better for it?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Twice? What happened? :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no, I did set an alarm (3) and still ignored them all\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just when I use the grill. The smoke detector gets upset.\\
Ha, easy to do.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I woke up and all I can smell is tomatoes and peppers :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone::woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Do you not do your sausages on a pan?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Is that a bad smell then?\\
Do mine on the grill. Mildly healthier\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no, it's not. This is a new one :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
Aaah ok, fair enough. I was imagining that ridged pan thing like cast iron\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: How the work going?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Doing little bits and pieces, procrastinating on everything else :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
How's gaming?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: At least you’re getting something done.\\
It’s ok. Matt is not on form so it’s rough.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Barely\\
Ah boo. Has he had his interview yet btw?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They've disabled all our usb ports at school so I have to migrate aaaaaaalll of my work into the drive :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Matt's had a first interview and next week he has a second \/ proper interview with a presentation etc. So he has all of this week to put it together.\\
How do you mean? you trying to copy off work stuff to your personal?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah ok!\\
So I have all my work stuff on a usb key (and backed up on my personal Gmail) but because they disabled usb access in all computers, I have to copy it all to work cloud\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: ahh, so your trying to get stuff onto work. That isn't the traditional way round. Did make me think. Make sure that anything you want to keep is on a personal cloud somewhere and before you tell work.\\
As soon as I told EY they automatically changed all sorts of access on my laptop.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well that's the thing... Now I'll have to download everything onto work cloud and then move it into personal, can't just dump it all in a usb :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Is it tons of data or just really annoying? My internet has fast upload if you need\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: A bit of both but my little laptop is trudging away. But thank you :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have you had dinner yet? And how's your water?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just having it now. The scotch eggs are good.\\
The water is wet :grinning-face:but drinking it.\\You?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Omg the scotch egg is really nice! Thank you again :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
I'm about 400ml short of my target. What's yours?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I haven’t been tracking the exact amount but I’ll do 3 more pints before bed.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The app recons I need 5l a day!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nooooooo\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Definitely not 5l\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'd say 3 at most,no?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I would agree. So I wasn’t aiming for 5. At least 3 plus what ever would be drank at the gym.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And if you include your other liquids it will be 5 anyway\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Try tracking exactly to see what it does. Like my glasses are 250ml so I just put that in every time I knock one down :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I started and then miss counted while gaming\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah. Understandable, you were distracted.\\
Did it end up being any better?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It didn’t end up worse. Stayed fairly consistent. Its how it goes sometimes days. Some good moments just lacking the consistency.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Are you done with work now?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah I'm sure it will be better next time.\\
We should play together some time if that's possible?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: To be honest, I haven't done much. I'll get on with stuff when I'm in tomorrow morning.\\
And just after I said my laptop was working on it, it decided to majorly slow down so will need to finish the transfer during the week :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: “That’s what she said”\\
We would need another setup of the game to try it out. Xbox one or PS4 or higher or a PC that can play the game.\\The pc I have in the loft might just about work.\\Would be good to play some games.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It heard you :face-with-tears-of-joy:.\\
Can you do the transfer at school?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
I'd like that, if we could\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No, no USBs. So will have to do it at home.\\
Just unnecessary workload\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Could be rage inducing but I also cannot believe you could be worse than Seb\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah\\
Well if that isn't a vote of confidence I don't know what is :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s completely different but I’d like us to try some co-op games\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You may have to suffer through some videos to get an idea of what’s going on.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. I'll give it a go. But I've only ever played solo first - person shooter type stuff\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've YouTube'd plenty of walk throughs in my time\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Do you have a monitor?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Keyboard mouse?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I only have my laptop and mouse\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Are you used to mouse and keyboard or controller\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Controller. I still have my 360 in the cupboard :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Needs to be a newer Xbox but I do have an Xbox controller for the PC. Just need to see if it will work with what I have.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yeah, I don't even know if it still works. Should really try it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: In theory it should\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I haven't used it in over 4 years\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Last time I played I borrowed a PS4\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: A PS4 works\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't have it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Then that doesn’t work :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I borrowed it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ve got a feeling someone might have a spare Xbox we might be able to test on. I’ll get the brain working\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You know someone for everything\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well, we will see.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think it could be fun\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Absolutely it could be fun. Assuming you like the game.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I guess we'll see about the game\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've pottered successfully all the way into bed\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've got very mixed feelings about tomorrow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have you had any more masters replies?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: In what way?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No replies yet. Hopefully tomorrow or at least this week\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Fingers crossed. More applications this week?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you feeling as bit better about it all?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think I can do one this week without any replies.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: A bit. Still disappointing but it is what it is. Just need to see what this next phase looks like.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: In what way?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm here to help in any way I can. Just give me hints :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: I don't want to be overbearing or something\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The usual Sunday scaries, but also a little bit of weight of my shoulders, but also terrified about what's coming with telling people and resignations...\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What are you terrified of? Disappointing people?\\
You’re not disappointing anyone. You moving to the next stage of life \/ career.\\They should all be happy for you. <This message was edited>\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: People might be a bit shocked. They might ask why but that really should be all that happens. There might be some specific stuff they want doing.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It might be easy to say. But I have really deep relationship, past work colleagues, with these people. I'm sure they will be happy for me but still\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And they will be plenty shocked. Very much a part of the furniture at that school by now :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And the fact I'm leaving mid year\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Barely mid year in my mind.\\
It is easy to stay and this is how people do stay at jobs for a very long time.\\Change is always scary but it’s also the start of something new.\\What are you meant to do. Stay at a jobs that breaks you just to keep your friends from some unknown thing. Friends wouldn’t want that.\\It will be an adjustment for everyone but they should be excited for you.\\For whatever reason. Stuff just doesn’t stay the same. Change is required.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well anything before the exams is mid year in teaching.\\
I know you are right. But I do need to work through things in my mind. This is such a massive thing for me. It's not just changing a job. It's been my everything for so long, a vocation you might say. I've poured everything into it and it was\/is my identity. What's happening now is proper life changing for me. So I will need time to sort my thoughts and I might just need an ear to listen to me sorting them out loud :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You do need to work things through.\\
You say it is\/was but being a teacher doesn’t define who you are.\\I’m here to listen if you need me. (Just say up front if you want me to ask questions \/ offer solutions while your talking)\\While it is not the same. As someone who has done a few life changing things in the not so distant past. They always work out better than you think and other people reactions are more positive than you might expect.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki, I'll let you know which one :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
I'm going to try get some sleep so I'm not completely comatose tomorrow.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night, sleep well x x x x x\\
P.S. I really like you\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sleep is good.\\
\section*{Monday $19\textsuperscript{th}$}
Night x x x x x x x x x\\I really like you as well.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00010472-GIF-2024-02-19-06-19-56.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x\\
I'm up and not crying!\\Woke up in the middle of the night and couldn't get back to sleep but apart from that I'm okay.\\How are you? How did you sleep?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh that’s no fun. Furry overlord or just woke up.\\
I’m ok. As always, some more sleep would be better.\\How much sleep did you get then?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Needed the loo. I was nice and sleepy but the moment I got back to bed I was wide awake\\
Would setting a fixed bedtime be helpful?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Relatively good amount of deep sleep at least.\\
My phone does yell at me for bedtime\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha, so you don't listen?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What's the plan for the gym today?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I sometimes listen to it.\\
Going to do legs today. Seen the plan and it looks suitably mean. Just got to get it done. Then I can try and get my assignment done that due this week.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's a solid plan!\\
Is it a hard assignment?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s a bit of a mixed bag. Some of it makes sense and then some questions are all over the place. This one is odd as the first 2\/3 is exam practice which isn’t marked and is the hard bit and the last 1\/3 is based on an exercise and some self reflection question which I can all do quite well.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Both the modules I’m on are brand new so we are the test students and you can tell they are still trying to gauge how it is all tested.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It does sound complicated. But I'm sure if you knuckle down to it you'll be able to knock it out :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s the plan. We will see.\\
Good luck at school x x x\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
Have a good gym sesh x x x x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m assuming you got to school ok?   Are you worked?\\
Gym session was good. Much better than Fridays.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Second question should have been\\
Car worked?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, got here alright. Magically acquired more petrol on the gauge :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah glad gym was good!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's work going?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, gauge might just be right on the edge of a segment.\\
Work is going ok. Have got stared at least.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: How is school going?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good, hope it all goes well\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's been okay. Y7 were of course absolutely bloody cute and wonderful which might have misted my eye\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: of course they were nice. Probably could have but money on that. Do you have your year 10 group to balance out the day?\\
Are you telling school today?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I had y10 first thing, but they were too sleepy to be weird.\\
I'm not. I kind of really want the contract.\\I might go for a coffee with my hod tomorrow and give her the heads up and then notice by Friday\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Waiting for the contract is a good idea, as long as they can deliver it before your cut off date.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, I was thinking about giving them until Thursday, chasing them and hopefully have it sorted by Fri\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: If you dont hear anything I'd nudge Wednesday lunch. That gives some chance you'd get something by Friday. It will no doubt need about 3 or 4 peoples input before they can send you something.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well both hiring managers signed it off, I accepted, so it needed to go to the UK HR peeps for them to sort contract\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Home now from an early finish.\\
How's the assignment going?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: earlier than I though you'd be home. How you feeling?\\
Erm, I got slightly distracted and have applied for a masters instead. Back on the assignment now.\\Soup was good BTW.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's that one Monday every two weeks I don't have last period so I can leave early.\\
Debating nap or gym :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: and I have bookclub later\\Ooh where did you apply? Love a bit of productive procrastination.\\Aw I'm glad you liked it :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: could you nap after the gym? or just nap.\\
\url{https://www.herts.ac.uk/}\\Applied here. They do a research astronomy masters and would be the least annoying place to get to that isn't my office.\\Going to give UCL a couple more days to see if they reply and if not just apply anyway.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh cool! How many days in do they expect?\\
That's a good plan. You might as well apply. Nothing to lose (just the £90)\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: No idea on the onsite requirement but best to assume 5 for now. Inevitable it will be 3 or 4.\\
The £90 really doesn't matter at this point. Not compared to the costs so far. Not even a rounding error.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: What choice has won. Gym nap or magic option 3\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I theoretically have all the tools and stuff now to do the wire repair on your car. SO we can plan that in\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to go to the gym for at least a little while :face-with-rolling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh you absolute star. But please let me know what monies I owe you for the bits\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Showing up at the gym is most of the battle\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Let's see if I fix the car first but the wire loom extension bit was £25 and I've been waiting for an excuse to get the tools :grinning-face:\\
I checked with my brother and he has installed loads of them but I should be able to do it all. He is on kid duty for the next 3 weeks so getting his time would be hard. The hardest bit is going to be getting the interior panel off. Well that's actually not true. It will very easily come off, its just doing it correctly.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. If you think it will be easy that we can try that. I'm happy to wait if need be :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I also need to figure out what mats to get. There are two sets\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: do you have links?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: the wire bit of the fix is easy. Just cut and crimp.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: \url{https://finestcarmats.co.uk/collections/fiat-500-car-mats?gad-source=1&gclid=CjwKCAiA8sauBhB3EiwAruTRJtA7XNJ8-jeEiIc4fvf804METYgW-09XfYSg8HOrx9l92ZEa3yBIyhoCzrEQAvD-BwE}\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i'd like to try and fix it sooner rather than later as we need to fix that before trying to fic the flashing miles thing.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh, you have a model year change car.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Does the V5 or anything give a year that might hint\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: This site doesn't have an overlap of years \url{https://www.carmats4u.com/tailored-car-mats/fiat-car-mats/fiat-500-car-mats/fiat-500-2007-2012.html} and it matches the outline of the other site.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So my guess would be 2007-2012\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: does it look like the matt has to be bigger on the passenger side\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: and how many holes are there for the matt on the drivers side. My guess is one, in the middle\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll have to have a look when I get back :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: thank you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't want to distract you from assignment!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: erm…. I'll get back on it now. Car matts is much easier\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well I successfully performed the role of human rattle at the gym. I cracked literally with every move I made :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, at least the music is so loud people wouldn't hear\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly :face-with-rolling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It was quite busy too\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: all of my question so far are merging, rearranging or try to create new formula's for stuff :man-facepalming::man-facepalming::man-facepalming::man-facepalming::man-facepalming::man-facepalming::man-facepalming::man-facepalming:\\
Monday evening was always mental\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh power through! You can do it!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: <attached: 00010538-GIF-2024-02-19-16-51-50.mp4>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: SO.\\
MANY.\\REPS.\\OUCH\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: in having to do my own counting I have found that I cannot count at all\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's normal though,no?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: probably normal. I just cry with lots of reps\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: more weight less reps = betterer\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah ok :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: today was 4x10@200. Could not count to 10 and could not count to 4\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: my worst was the end 3x30\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's loads of reps\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Strong man!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: well. Strongish. The 3x30 was because we ran out of weight on the machine but the new row machine they have goes very high. So the reps will come down.\\
I was super annoyed at my sumo failure at 150 despite not that many people being able to lift 150 at all\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Progress not perfection :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: yep.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00010553-GIF-2024-02-19-17-00-07.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Assignment?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :loudly-crying-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: nearly 7 tons. NICE\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It does a muscle split and all\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Right, no more distractions!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Bookclub got rescheduled to next week.... I can rest!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have you finished with work?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: WooHoo rest time.\\
Just finished. Now to cook some food.\\It was the lip smacker on the tutorial who basically read the slides :man-facepalming:. brain was already broken but I find it super hard to switch between topics. Think its because they are quite similar but also not\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no, the lip smacker :loudly-crying-face: I wouldn't be able to sit through that.\\
I have the same thing.\\How was the tutorial?\\And what are you cooking?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: it was ok. Not ground breaking.\\
I have no idea what i'm cooking. Either pasta or bacon sandwich. I think bacon as its less faff and I can clean while doing it\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: depending on what I eat I;m not sure I need to proper shop or cook this week and next week\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Bacon with what?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah nice! Do you have stuff from last week?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sandwich with eggs. Will be tomorrow after the run.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Had stuff in freezer from last 2 weeks and got bacons from last week and 2 carbonara things to cook.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You're all sorted\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Any hidden veggies?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And a bacon and egg sandwich? No\\
Freezer meals yes\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Do I bug you too much about this?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m not sure there is a positive way to answer that question.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just an honest way. I'm just worried I do\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You bring it up quite consistently. I am very aware I don’t eat a lot of vegetables and the ones I do eat are not done in the traditional way.\\
I’d love to just buy a salad and eat it but my body just locks up. Full on texture issue, that I am glacially getting better at.\\Not that long ago (2 years) I ruined a meal by putting peas in. Now I can add some.\\I’m just not going to switch overnight to suddenly eating tons of veg. So I sneak them in.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: The chilli Michelle made was right on the limit for me.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you for explaining (once again). I'll check myself in this better.\\
For some reason I just fixed on the fact when you said you wanted\/needed to sort your food but obviously didn't go about it the right way, even if it's coming from a caring place. I'm sorry.\\Is there any way I can help?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: When I said I need to sort my food I’d was related to meal planning.\\
Don’t think I need any help at the moment.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah okay. Sorry I misunderstood\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not sure you need to be sorry. Thank you for asking.\\
Are you ok?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah, I just had a moment of spiral. I thought I'd messed up\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Your fine :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
Resting hasn’t gone well then?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You could say.\\
I finished the file transfers though and am in bed with a book.\\What have you been up to? Have you had your dinner yet?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s good.\\
Book nerd :nerd-face:\\Is it good?\\Yeah had dinner.\\Just about to play some games. All I’ve done this afternoon is some work, the tutorial and then eat.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just started it the other day so still not really sure what it's about :woman-shrugging-light-skin-tone:\\
You've done loads of work today! Go and make sure you relax and unwind\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Btw, have we arranged when we're seeing each other this week?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s super relaxing playing this very stressful game :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, I did want to say that\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I had noticed that as well. I would have said Thursday but I have a tutorial\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I've got Steph on Thursday :disappointed-face:\\
Friday?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Friday works.\\
Anything you’d like to do?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'd love to go for a walk but it's still too dark. Maybe I can get us some food\/cook something (you'll have to give me ideas). We could play some games, or watch a film?\\
What do you fancy doing?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Might be right on the walk. Another few weeks I think.\\
Games and film is good idea.\\We have new card games to try and I could try and get a co-op game up and running.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sounds good. Have a think about what you'd fancy for food and I'll sort it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to turn in soon.\\
Hope the games are not too stressful.\\Night night, sleep well x x x x x\\Like you (loads)\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night x x x x\\
Curry?\\Guessing Friday at your place?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I can come to you. That way we can have the games?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s true. I just know you wanted us to spend more time at yours.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know. But it might be easier? And I know it's not the most enjoyable to eat on a futon too\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Would be easier.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Then if you'll have me we'll do Friday at yours\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s a date!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\section*{Tuesday $20\textsuperscript{th}$}
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00010605-GIF-2024-02-20-06-17-16.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x\\
You're up early! Spin?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah spin today. It is early.\\
Hopefully as many people as last time. Much better with more people.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: How are you this morning?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Fingers crossed there's a good turnout\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm okay. Can definitely feel the gym\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How did you sleep?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I bet you can feel the gym with all the stuff you did.\\
I slept ok. Woke up just before my alarm which is odd. Think I react to the heating.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: What was your sleep like?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly I can't wait to be able to switch the heating off for the spring :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you doing the run tonight?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That the plan. Unless it’s mega raining.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Need to sort my torch out as I guess it will get dark\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I might come too, but will see how I'm feeling after work\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Same!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that's good.\\
What's the bad bit? Are you not doing that bsc?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Nope. Technically I am studying a Natural Science BSc with the open university but that is really to cover student loan rules. All I am doing is a selection of astronomy modules. After I have done the 2 I am on I would be at least 2 years away from finishing it as a BSc\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ooooooh ... What did you reply?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Asked them to clarify if the offer is still valid based on what I am doing and re listed what I have done \/ am doing. Will see what I get backk\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It would really be helpful of they read the applications, wouldn't it?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: it would be quite helpful if people would read it. Especially as this information is one THEIR application system, at the end of my personal statement AND on my CV\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Academia, ey\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your day been apart from this? <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s been ok. Spin was only ok. I tweaked something yesterday so couldn’t go mad and tempered a bit so I can run later.\\
The assignment is hard and I’m mad at myself for not doing one of the questions months ago but should get it all done today.\\Just getting lunch and then my Mum is coming over.\\How’s yours going?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh what did you tweak?\\
Sending strong academic vibes your way. I think after the last two assignments you'll be better with doing them as you go along.\\Anything nice for lunch? Is mum popping over for a catch up?\\Super full on today, just the littles today so it's all very high energy\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: seem to have tweaked a muscle on my back. Must have done one of the lifts wrong. Have done it before a long time ago. Hurts but not when a move. Bit weird. Should be gone by tomorrow or Thursday I think.\\
Had the soup :grinning-face: and parents bought over a donut. Had both of them turn up, just for a catch up. My mum goes on holiday for a week tomorrow with a friend. They were both excited about your new job and car.\\Hopefully good high energy.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully it will pass soon.\\
Aw, was it still nice? I'm glad you like when I make stuff :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\Aw, what good parents? What kind of donut?\\Aww that's so sweet of them. We should probably arrange the meeting and all, shouldn't we?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Soup was still good. I think the other one you make is better. More flavour.\\
Lidl donut :grinning-face:, they have there moments. My mum did have a slightly crazy hypothetical scenario where if I could pay off my brother mortgage. I would be the bank and it would be my income source.\\Yes we should. As my mum is away we could try for next weekend 2nd.\\I am doing a quiz night with them on the 29th if you wanted to do it then? Could be lateish.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Winter run, lets drive to westfields. Only 45 minutes. Then super easy on the tube. Shepherd bush to oxford circus to charring cross\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, I like the other one more too. I'll make a batch for us.\\
Oh nice! They know what you like.\\That is a big scenario. What did you think about it?\\Yes, I don't think I've got anything on that Saturday\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. Whatever is best. I'll go with your suggestion.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's the assignment?\\
I'm just stopping in Aldi for some fruit. Do you need anything?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Its a bit of a classic mum scenario. If I had a ton of money then its an idea but there isn't really a scenario where it benefits me. Even if you assume I have the money just lying around. If I had a lot of money, like lottery win stuff, id just give my brother the money anyway.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I do not like the assignment. I know I know stuff but I just dont know enough stuff to know how to confidently answer the questions. Its all learning but I dont like it.\\
I dont need anything. You could grab the aldi steaks for us to try on Friday? Unless you wanted something else.\\Good timing on getting home\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Give yourself some time to really delve into it if needed. When is it due?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ooooh yes, let me have a look if they have them\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Or sirloin?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: up to you but we could give the fancy ones a try. Sauce as well?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Due on Thursday but I have loads of other module work to do as well.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They don't have proper sauce just packets :disappointed-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How about giving it one more hour tomorrow morning and then concentrating on other stuff?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i think that's what i'll do\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Are you going to be joining us on the run?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hmmmm, really want to. I might come and just do as much as I can\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And would be lovely to get a cuddle\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m not sure how much cuddling can be done but you can certainly have a hug :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You know what I mean :face-with-tears-of-joy: I'm trying to be cute here :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i know, i was trying to be cute as well\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha good :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Nice seeing you.\\
I’ll admit I had a pretty good view for a lot of that run :winking-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, I'm glad I look good in a spot light :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It was lovely seeing you too :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Look at you!! Well done, that's absolute loads\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is all liquid not just water. Coffee tea, protein shake etc\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aaaah okay\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Still loads\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, the original target of 5l maybe wasn’t that crazy.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think they mean water only. And in that case that would be way too much\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm already in bed :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, his proud catch of the day.\\
A deserved bed time.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Very! On both accounts. I can feel every little muscle in my body\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have you had dinner yet?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Eaten an now gaming. Will shower later :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, priorities :winking-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope you have fun and it's not too stressful\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll say night night now as I might just crash.\\
Sleep well x x x x x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night x x x x x x x x x x x\\
\section*{Wednesday $21\textsuperscript{st}$}
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00010677-GIF-2024-02-21-07-47-12.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x\\
Thank you. I am huuurty :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\How about you?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh no. That’s no good. On what scale? “Normal” gym hurt or worse.\\
I’m a bit stiff but ok. Body isn’t back used to this level of running.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh much worse than gym :disappointed-face: yeah, I think that's my problem too.\\
What's your plan for today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ooph that is not good sleep. That won’t have helped at all.\\
Got to take the car for MOT, Phil should be fixing my bathroom extractor fan.\\I WILL finish my assignment.\\No games today. So not sure what the late afternoon evening will bring. Will see what brain power I have left after uni work.\\Will you have time for a CBD bath later?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh you've got a busy day!\\
I'm not sure but I will have one if I have time.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm getting a bit anxious about the whole contract\/ resigning\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is understandable. Change is like that.\\
Have you got the contract yet? If not I would send a little nudge update email this morning.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No I don't. That's what's making me anxious\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I really didn’t expect that you’d have it yet and I’m not sure the right person would understand the urgency for it. Thus the nudge.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. I'll just send "would you have any updates on the contract as I am keen to hand in my notice at my current place"?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You could expand a little.\\
“Hi,\\Hope all is well. Just wanted to see if there was any update on when a copy of the contract will be sent to me?\\Teaching is a bit different from most roles and I have a cut off date that I need to resign before in order for me to be able to meet our May 7th start date. The cut of is Monday 26th Feb.\\While I don’t expect to have any issues with the contract it would be good to see before I formally hand in by notice”\\Or something. Really just making them aware of a deadline.\\Also it’s clear they want you for the job and you have the offer email so it would be extremely extremely unlikely for something to go wrong.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: As for the actual resigning bit of the process. I personally wouldn’t do it on the Friday. I’d have my email all ready to go. Tell my HOD what’s happening and then immediately send the email to the head teacher (I assume), school HR and CC your HOD. Then all the right people have all the information all at once.\\
Resignation Email will need to state when your last working day is. Which no doubt you were going to do anyway. It’s very much a telling work type email rather than you asking them any questions.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Remember that this is exciting and a good thing that you are doing for YOUR better life.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll have to have a conversation with the head before sending the email but yes. All that is planned. I need to write it in my drafts\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s good to tell people but not leave a gap as who ever you tell will immediately tell other people.\\
The email doesn’t need to be long and you don’t need to explain anything.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've sent the email\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m assuming you mean about the contract. Well done.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yea\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That would be a power move if I just decided to resign by email while sitting next to everyone in the office :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, that’s something I might do :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Then if they read it you know they are not paying attention.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I really just need to tell people to get it off my chest\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yes\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It is a very much “hurry up and wait” type time when transitioning\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Now I'm waiting for her to reply to my email :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :face-with-rolling-eyes: that might take a while.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Booooo\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Out of everyone involved in the process you care the most but can do the least.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Literally :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Car MOT passed.\\
Bathroom fan fixed.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Eeey well done!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just had contract through\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Asked my hod for a meeting and she straight away freaked out and said please tell me you're not leaving.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That's much faster than I thought they would be on the contract. Good its come through. Have you had a chance to read it?\\
Oh dear, I guess people make assumptions when stuff happens out of the ordinary.\\Have you got the resignation email ready to go? Once you tell your HOD she will tell others.\\Good luck.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: in other more light hearted news. I have done a quick test and we can play my PC games on the TV in the living room. I've ordered a couple of controllers and bought that little puzzle co-op game. So we can try that out on Friday. Might open up a whole realm of co-op games for us to try out\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I haven't had a chance at all yet. Been teaching straight through and now in training.\\
She will keep it quiet until tomorrow and then I have to speak to the head before I send the email. That's the way\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Right so my hod couldn't wait and grabbed me just now. Told her everything\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: She said to just go speak to the head and get it done\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: that gets it done\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I have the contract so it's all good, right?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You HOD seems like you in ways. Doesn't like not knowing or secrets\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: in theory yes\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh we are so similar\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: In theory?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: if you have read the contract and its all good then yes\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: if not then there could be a spelling mistake or they could have the wrong salary info\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: but the contract itself is a 100\% clear indication of employment\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: oh yeah, your good. Assuming the salary numbers are correct and start date\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: there will be an overlap in your getting the required tax document. Unless they have sped this up in the last few years. They should expect that.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Can I just screen shot it to you?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: yep\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just to know if it's standard?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: This message was deleted.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: This message was deleted.\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: This message was deleted.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: This message was deleted.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: There's so much more but that's the main part\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have speed read and all look good. Pretty normal stuff and the numbers seem right.\\
Seems like they have a portal system similar to EY for sorting pension, holiday and benefits. So that is good. Your all set\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Im okay to share the contract with you?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: if you like\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No I mean the screenshot. I'm not going to get done for it? :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: oh yeah\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: that's fine\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, okay\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I guess I need to go speak to the head now\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: it would be very bad for them to say you cannot show the contract to someone\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: plus how would they know\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't know! But you know my brain\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think NDA's cannot be shared and I've seen plenty of stuff that cannot be shared but employment contracts are fine\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: There is an nda\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm just going to unsend the pics so I don't spiral :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: well, you wont be able to share what ever the NDA covers\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: its really fine to have shared what you have\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: breath\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am crapping myself\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: tell the boss\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: its then done\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: breath\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: your not in trouble and you havnt done anything wrong and you aren't doing anything wrong\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh my god she's already gone\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: HA, sounds about right. Boss gone home while people are still working\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: oh well\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Bloody hell\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: nothing you can do about it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just stress until tomorrow\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: only if you let it. No way to do or change anything. At least tonight you can write the email. Get to school in the morning. Tell them, hit send and start the day. Which would be the exact same way tomorrow would start if they already knew\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh you and your logic :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: it has to be done :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
You can if you really want. Drive yourself mad worrying about stuff that you can do nothing about. Which will only make you feel bad either mentally or physically or both and at the same time stop you doing stuff like just having a chill evening.\\OR you can choose to go through the steps of what needs to be done and when and then just implement it.\\I'm guessing you HOD reacted differently than you expected?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We both had a little cry because we haven't had time for a big one. That's coming\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: there is plenty of time for crying :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: all of March and April\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well use the time wisely\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: *we'll\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just parked up at home.\\
How has your day been?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Long day for you.\\
Days been pretty good. This morning went well and my assignment is finished. Finally.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yay! Well done!\\
What did you get up to?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: When?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Today :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You’ve mushed your brain today.\\
MOT and bathroom fan got fixed. That was this morning. Then this afternoon all I’ve done is a bit of life admin and then finished the assignment.\\Just had food.\\Will be playing games later as Matt’s plans changed.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: How are you feeling now you’ve got the contract (well done) and told your HOD.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah. It is but I do remember the morning bits.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just reading through it.\\
I'm not sure how I'm feeling yet. Once I tell everyone I need to tomorrow and send in the notice I think it'll start to sink in\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What yummy dinner did you have?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It will take a little while to sink in and then there might be this weird gap where it’s all normal until the last couple of weeks.\\
Then the new adventure begins.\\Had to change up dinner as the bacon I bought for pancakes has a much shorter date than I expected so I repeated the bacon egg sandwich from yesterday.\\Have you eaten?\\How the hurting from running?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've just noticed my postcode is wrong on the contract :pensive-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s an easy fix for them.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll email her back now\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no about the bacon but at least you caught it in time\\
I might have stopped for my last big tasty of the season :see-no-evil-monkey:\\Still hurting quite a bit\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, how long is big tasty season?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Only like 2 weeks, finishes this week :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What are your plans to relax this evening?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well I've just finished with reading the contract. These corporate ones are scary!\\
I'm going to wash my hair and start my potter towards bed :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\Have you started with the games yet?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: They can be scary but it looked pretty normal to me.\\
Crazy plans but a good idea.\\Just started\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you very much for having a look at it for me :smiling-face-with-hearts: and for every single other thing.\\
You are my actual hero :purple-heart:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Enjoy! Hope it's not too stressful\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No problem at all.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know you like helping but I need you to know how much I appreciate you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thank you. I do like helping\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've finally pottered into bed.\\
How's the gaming?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Painful. It’s rough tonight. No consistancy. Other than being shit.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha. Do you enjoy it?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: When it’s going well yes. Then it’s actually good fun.\\
I’d like to know what it’s like player with good team mates. I’m the best and im not very good.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy: well hopefully you'll all improve with time\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: To win is hard. So it’s good when we win\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well this is year 3 :man-facepalming:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Lol!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Wait, I might even be worse\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It would help if Matt and Seb actively tried to get better. Matt just likes burning the time.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well he might not have as much burning time when he gets the job\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Then there is no excuse for the last 2 months :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you up for spin tomorrow?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep, just the 30min class then arm session Friday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Then not much Saturday before pain of Sunday.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh god it will be hard\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I need to make sure I don't do lower body tomorrow\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yes, warn Steph. Otherwise you may break in half.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Will do\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll leave you to "enjoy" your gaming time :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Night night when you get to bed. Sleep well x x x x x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night x x x x x x x\\
Hope you sleep well and get rid of some of the run pain.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Melatonin?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just magnesium tonight\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Melatonin Friday?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes!!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Can I shower at yours on Fri?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: If you like.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Are we doing dinner on Saturday? I’d thought no but we never spoke about it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I didn't think we were. Do you want to?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I didn’t think so either.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Depending when will finishes maybe we could go for a little walk?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Do you have plans for Saturday?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I don’t know how long Will will be and thought you want a nap rest for Sunday and we will see each other most of Sunday.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I mean yes, you are right\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yes to walk\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What's your plan for sat?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Get to your place. Will does his thing. Lunch somehow. That was it.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No master plan as all depend me how long Will takes. Then an early night cos of run.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :smiling-face: good plan. I can make soup if you want\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Only other plan was I might have pizza\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Soup for lunch is good\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I should sleep :sleeping-face:\\
Night x x x x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yes sleep\\
\section*{Thursday $22\textsuperscript{nd}$}
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00010855-GIF-2024-02-22-06-16-40.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x\\
I'm okay. Didn't sleep great but I kind of expected that :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\How are you?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh so you slept as much as you wanted then :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
You all set to talk to the head. Then it’s all done and just becomes a weighting game.\\I have woke up proper tired today. Woke up before my alarm and was confused if I had gone off or not but just went back to sleep. Odd. Spin will kill or cure.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: All set is a relative term. I've emailed yesterday for a meeting so hopefully she'll reply. And hopefully I'll get the corrected contract too today.\\
Oh no! Did you go to bed late?\\Hope spin is good and it will cure!\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Even if she doesn’t reply I’d just try and see her this morning before the day really starts. You really only need 60seconds (that’s what he said). Just to get all the info out and get the process started. A more formal meeting might be needed later.\\
Contract getting the right address is a separate issue now.\\No later than  normal just probably a bit high strung from it all being shit :man-facepalming:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I will, but they are super special about meetings without appointments :face-with-rolling-eyes:\\
I have signed it. That's okay isn't it?\\From the games being shit?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I would have waited for the address to be right before signing it but doesn’t change anything.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sometimes people just need to be told information. This would be a non normal meeting for the head. I assume.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll meet with her somehow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You said you were high strung from all being shit - all meaning the games or something else?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just games.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just leaving. Hope spin is good!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good is subjective but it does have a good crowd and I feel better doing than if I’d have just slept. Which is good and annoying.\\
It’s funny at points. In spin women will complain that 1 minute is a long time :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's done. I cried\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done. Do you feel a bit better?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, I've told my dept too. They are all happy for me\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Is that not the response you expected?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh it is\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Soo, all the stress was for?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's not the point\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's how I am\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What are you up to today?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just about to submit my assignment, then I have a bunch of cosmology work to get on with. Depending on how that goes I might do some house cleaning or leave it to tomorrow. Got a tutorial this evening. That's about it.\\
What time is your session with Steph?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well done on submitting the assignment. Hope the cosmology work is more exciting. You like cosmology don't you?\\
Session is at 5.30. need to tidy the flat a bit as well. I'll do all the furniture moving for Will on Saturday morning\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I like it but I think I prefer the astrophysics stuff. Cosmology is a lot more theory. The big bang stuff over the last few weeks has been very interesting. Just got stuck in a weird loop of source control as I'm trying to run there code on my system.\\
We can move the furniture as needed on Saturday. I dont think the beading will take them very long. It will be the thresholds that take the time.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Is there an assessment from this one too?\\
Oki, but I'll still need to tidy up a bit :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\I'm ready to go home now!\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah there’s an assessment. This next one is all code based. So should be good.\\
Tidy up is fine. Bookcases could be fun to move.\\You lasted longer than I would at work.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh nice! That should be easy for you.\\
I've got felt strips on the bottom of those so hopefully shouldn't be too too bad.\\Have you had lunch yet?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m hoping so, we will see.\\
Just more of the topple risk. Might just have to move the books onto the sofa.\\Yep, just had it.\\How’s the running hurt?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah will sort it out in the morning :smiling-face:\\
I'm still hurting but it's not the running now. Just a general fibro pain now, the stress didn't help\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I guess that's good :man-shrugging: that the running pain has gone at least. Hopefully the stress will be lower now its all done\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I feel like I'm just going to crash from all this adrenaline :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good luck with your gym session. You doing drugs before or after?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you. I'm desperately trying to summon some energy :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Drugs after, definitely.\\Did you have a good day?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Days been ok. Spent more time troubleshooting code issues than doing the code but that’s how it goes. Did at least prove out the new dev machine I’ve built. So tomorrow I’m hoping to rattle through some stuff.\\
That and spin is about it for the day.\\Let me know how your session went.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You've had a productive day though! Well done! Tomorrow should be a breeze.\\
Well she bloody killed me as per. I really want a chilled two hours but I need to eat, and clean and sort the contract.\\I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed to be honest ( just needed to get it out)\\Can't wait to squeeze you tomorrow\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: All you need to do is eat. Contract can wait, doesn’t need to be done today. Cleaning can wait as well unless it will relax you doing it.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Up to anything fun tonight?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Got my tutorial in 10 mins. That should be an absolute rager :face-with-tears-of-joy:. Then I have no idea. Probably zone out watching some tv.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, wild night ahead!!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you okay in general? I feel like a lot of stuff has been about me recently and I don't want you to feel, I don't know, overlooked or something\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, I'm ok.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sorry for the short answer. Just wanted to say something before the tutorial so you didn't read into a non reply.\\
Tough tutorial. Went all crazy in the middle with first and second derivative equations.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Appreciate that.\\
I have no idea what those are! I'd love to find out but I worry even an explanation wouldn't help :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\Was it useful though?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I apricate the check in. The last few weeks have been more focused on you but that just the way it goes sometimes. Your making big changes. I think its meant we haven't had super high quality time, which is again ok as it will get better.\\
Somehow half term feels like it was a month ago and not last week.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: first and second derivative equations are my nightmares. These is the stuff I really dont get.\\
The best explanation I have is that you have speed, then acceleration is the first derivative of speed. The rate at which speed is changing. The second derivative is jerk (for real) which is how fast the acceleration is changing.\\Not that this helps me with the equations\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: then after Jerk you have snap, crackle and pop. Again not a joke. Scientist think they are funny\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, that's how I've been feeling. Sorry if I haven't been as present as I could\/should have been. I think as it's all coming together I'm starting to get super overwhelmed and I have been going at 100 for a while. Please don't feel like you have to take this on. I just need to go through it and process. I've signed the contract and sent it through.\\
Let's make sure we schedule in proper quality time in the coming weeks, please? Something you fancy doing?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I have absolutely no idea :face-with-tears-of-joy: maths has really never been my strong suit\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But this is hilarious :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How come the overwhelmedness (not a word) is getting worse? I'd have thought it would bleed off now people know.\\
I did feel like I annoyed you a few times over the weekend, which I'm not trying to do on purpose.\\I'm defiantly up for us doing stuff. Obviously. We can plan something for next Saturday 2nd and maybe an evening next week. We might have pencilled in meeting the parents at the pond (not confirmed with them). I feel that as your very stressed (maybe not the right word) about changing jobs and that your brain converts this into body pain we might just have to see on the day what we can do? A walk would be a good start, although that may be rough even for me after parkrun.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think it's because I've done the thing. The future is uncertain and you know how much I like predictability :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
It's just such a mahoosive life thing for me. But I will just process through it. And a lot of new things happened over the last two weeks or so too. I'll calm down soon.\\When did you think you annoyed me over the weekend?\\Do you not have your fayre next weekend? But very much up for planning something.\\I would love to meet your parents so we can definitely plan that :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\We could do a little walk, but also depending how broken I am after Sunday :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\Btw! Did you get a t-shirt with your pack?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Didn't get a winter run t-shirt.\\
Yes, bollox. I have the fair on the 2nd and 3rd. So that's the weekend gone. You could meet my parents at the fair? that would actually be very casual.\\I felt like I annoyed you at the food market, in superdrug and then again on Sunday at your place when you didn't like my Paired answers.\\Hopefully any brokenness from Sunday doesn't carry over to the weekend after.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah okay. I thought they snubbed me :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
I could! I definitely planned to pop in to see you there\\No you didn't annoy me at all. I was a bit gutted about missing the pistachio pastry thing but that wasn't you. Superdrug was just because I like to potter and I know you don't, but I wasn't annoyed. And it's not that I didn't like your answers, not at all. I was just checking because I was worried there was something I wasn't doing. So again, definitely not annoyed at you :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\If you ever feel like that, please check in with me so we can talk about it straight away.\\Hopefully. But you know me :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think you had to pay extra for a t-shirt and I certainly didn't.\\
Well, if you pop in to see me there will be a high chance of my parents being there so best to assume it will happen.\\Ok, I wouldn't have minded you going around super drug. Assuming it wasn't going to take 40 minutes and I didn't think I said anything. So when you said the reason we were leaving my brain just went "She's annoyed at you". Then it just feels the dumbest thing to ask "Are you annoyed at me" because if your not then asking the question will make you and if you are then asking the question makes it worse. At least that is the logic my brain uses.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I didn't either.\\
Okie doke. I'll better be on my best behaviour then :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\It wasn't about you, I just wanted to potter and I didn't know where anything was so just wanted to leave.\\In all honesty, for me it's not a dumb question because I think it often too so just ask it if you're thinking it and then I'll either say no and we can talk about how I made you feel like that. Or I'll say say and then we can talk about how to resolve it. I really want to keep the cards on the table policy :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Weird question - do you have the photo of the magnesium I've sent you? I can't find it and need to reorder :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you send me a pic of it?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, but don't even know when :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah thank you :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Was just stocking up my old lady pill box :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Btw I'll be doing a myprotein order if you need anything?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll have a think but I don’t think so. Got loads of protein powder from their last deal.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oooooh\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. They do have a 70\%off at the mo too\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I probably need some magnesium\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's like 2.50\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll take some then if that’s ok\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Isn’t it your bed time :yawning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Of course, I'll get you some\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It is. Still on my way pottering. I didn't manage to hoover but did a closing shift\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: A what?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Like a closing shift of the flat :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Dishes, put away little bits\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did you end up watching TV?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sorted the steam link instead\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What are we going to be playing?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ve got that pick park co-op puzzle game\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Cool! Look forward to it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Made it to bed\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done, that better than sleeping on the floor\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night, sleep well x x x x x x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night x x x x x x.\\
See you tomorrow\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: See you tomorrow x\\
\section*{Friday $23\textsuperscript{rd}$}
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00010945-GIF-2024-02-23-06-34-02.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How did you sleep? Are you off to the gym?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ooph only a little better.\\
I slept ok, took a while to get to sleep which was odd.\\Yep, got my session to get done from Hannah today. Hopefully it’s not too awful but I think there is some nasty stuff in it.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you just doing upper body?\\
In sure there will be some big heavy bits in there knowing Hannah :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, all upper body. Legs are still tired from Tuesday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have a good day. At least it’s all out there now.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope the sesh is good! Enjoy it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Let me know how gym went\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Dinner with Toria and Dan Saturday March 23rd?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, I am free!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Booked\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Brill brill\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Gym done. Rough. Not done bench in a while and couldn’t get the rhythm right. Shoulder did not like it. Back still not 100\% from Monday so that didn’t help.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You tweaked something on Monday didn't you?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But you've done it! :partying-face::partying-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What's the plan for rest of the day?\\
Also, with Toria are we going out to eat?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah tweaked a muscle in my back. It’s been getting better all week but just annoying.\\
Going to sit for a bit and then get some work done. Have to do a bit of tidying up as well as this women a really like is coming over for dinner later.\\Curreny the plan is to make a plan. 2 options. Go out or have dinner at mine.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh boo. I can run a massage gun over it later if it would help.\\
Let's go out for dinner. Then no one needs to cook or clean :smiling-face:\\I'll be popping to morissons on my way to you tonight to pick up some peppercorn sauce and some veg for me. Do you want me to get anything else?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Can try the gun. No doubt I’ll squeak.\\
Just need to pick a place then. Easy enough.\\Don’t think I need anything. Have you got pudding?\\While the thought is in my head. Do you want me to pick up Donald’s tomorrow for breakfast?\\What time do you think you’ll be over later? Still showering at mine?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, it's alright if you squeak a little :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Yeah we can do that closer to the time.\\No I haven't had a chance to pick up pudding but can do. Anything in particular you fancy?\\Oooh what a treat. That would be lovely.\\I'm hoping to leave reasonably on time. Would 5.30 be good?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh btw. Forgot to tell you. Fun thing happened on the drive in. The dash backlight kept going on and off, like 6 times. Then it went completely off. And then came on just as I parked...\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No real thoughts for pudding. Just see what takes you when you’re there.\\
5:30 works great for me. I’m not going anywhere :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\Very odd. Fiat wiring isn’t the best. Got to fix the boot first, reset everything and go from there. Might be able to have a go at it tomorrow depending on how long Will takes.\\Also need to see if the battery you have is a proper stop start battery. I’d personally turn off the stop start as they drive me mad in non hybrid cars.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha okay. I'll have a look\\
I know! Everything else was on, so not the same thing as was happening with the Corsa. But like the menu changed also, like it all reset itself\\Yeah, I've switched the stop\/start off straight up, it irritated me :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: There are always little things with a new car. We’ll get them sorted.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't wanna go into lessons :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s what all the students say.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What time are you thinking we need to be at the run on Sunday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Its going to be maybe 1 hour 10 from when we start driving to arriving at Charing Cross station\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I wasn't planning a bag drop\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hmm I'm not sure . I'd give it  longer than that. There's people getting the 7.36 central line from Ruislip that are in my wave.\\
I will want to be there for about 9.15 to be honest\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Where are you going to put your stuff? I'd need at least a hoody. I'm a \#coldgirl\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: they will get there early. Its an hour from west Ruislip on the tube to charing cross.\\
We should be able to get from Wycombe to charing cross in just over an hour\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: In your bag :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: So I'm doing bag drop then? :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: If you dropping a bag then we all can\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I def need to bag drop\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I was aiming for us to be at charing cross for 9\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okay, that sounds good\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Grey doesn't start until 9:40\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But you said it's 45mins drive to Westfield. Then park, then get to tube station, then trains are not going to be as frequent\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Tube is every 5 mins or so\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We'd need to get the 8.21 or 8.25 from shepherds Bush\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I may have math'd something wrong\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: we need to be driving by 7:30 then\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. How far is the station from shepherds Bush\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I've allowed for a 15 min walk from car park to station\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okie :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Picking Cally up?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: yep\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i'll get her on the way to you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I still have shotgun :beaming-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: already said\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :smiling-face-with-hearts::smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I just need to feed Spuddles and then can be on my way. Can I still shower at yours?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: yep, you at home already\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: great, see you in a bit. Don't forget food. You still going to Morisons\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Will pop to morissons on the way to you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I have the steaks. Just picking up sauce, veg and pud. Anything else?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: dont think so\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. Leaving in 2\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No peppercorn sauce\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Booo, i;m not sure what other sauces there are\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have a packet mix but it is horid\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: lets give it a go\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Home :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you for being the best x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s took a while\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did it?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Seemed to but maybe not. 15mins to get home?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah, and I was defogging. The back window definitely does absolutely nothing :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Glad you got home ok. Really enjoyed seeing you this evening.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Me too. I do love spending time with you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s good. Would be akward otherwise.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-rolling-eyes::face-with-rolling-eyes::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Why would it be awkward??\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It would have to be awkward if you were here not enjoying it.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I thought because maybe you also enjoy spending time with me :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: (teasing)\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That was implied. Of course I like spending time with you.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Implied doesn't work on me :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: you know that\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :face-with-rolling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Everything spelled out is the way\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you done drugs?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not yet\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Medicated and in bed\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done.\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thank you for the soup and everything else.\\
Get some heating on in the flat. Now I’m home I can feel how cold my feet are :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You are so welcome. Thank you for everything you do!\\
Sorry about the freezing conditions :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Don’t forget your work reference thingy\\

I'll make a cup of tea and get to them :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your afternoon been?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Played a couple of games with Matt. Half sorted stuff for the rest and tested a gel. Nothing bad happened.\\
I’m absolutely knackered for some reason.\\Going to watch another episode of drive to survive and then make dinner I think.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Probably save the bath for tomorrow\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: For the run not rest :man-facepalming:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How long will the work stuff take?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sounds nice and chilled.\\
You have done loads this week and even though we weren't doing loads physically this morning, it was still an early start and then mental energy\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I have to do that too\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not sure. Hopefully not loads of time\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Omg this is taking so long\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh no. Is it loads of questions?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: So many documents to upload\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How many can there be. Is this all to prove you can work in the uk?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Everything from addresses for last 7 years, all dates for jobs and universities, uploading passport, diplomas, payslips, DBS, share code for home office\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Payslips?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yea to confirm employment\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You managed to finish it yet?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, but just got an email I need to upload a P45 from my job 8 years ago :face-with-rolling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Got my stuff ready (at least I think). What did you have for dinner? I had pasta to carb load :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Urgh, I’m pretty sure I wouldn’t have a copy of mine.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I do. But I'll do it tomorrow I think\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Pizza :grinning-face: for the same reason.\\
Headphones, number, magnets, charged watch, fuel, water, bag, clothes, drugs, phone\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I have head phones, number and safety pins, hydration vest, bag, running clothes, hoody and a fleecy thing in the bag for afters, ibuprofen and need to charge my watch <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sounds like your all set\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How do you feel about an extreme day trip?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: They are mega extreme\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: All the rage these days\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I do want to go to Amsterdam\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Tuesday 9th march\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Wat\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Why a Tuesday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: They are all 3am starts\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha I know\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I was just looking because I'm on a EDT fb group :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's the extreme part. A full day somewhere without having to pay for a hotel\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It is all very extreme. How are you going to be awake for 20 hours\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Let alone me being awake and driving\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I wasn't asking those kinda questions :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okay okay. You and your logic :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: STN is a dump and a real pain to get. Nearly a 2 hour drive.\\
LTN is crap as well but at least only an hour away\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: If it wasn’t mega money I liked the idea of Amsterdam via the train.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It would be about £150 mid week\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: £93 same day return.\\
And I meant to say 9th April\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: For the train?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I wasn’t necessarily thinking same day return but probably just as fast when you take into account airport faff\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's a long train journey\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll stop now :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’d have thought a mega day trip would be the zoo first?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes please :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Or we just need to find a way to sleep in the same room\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, that would be ideal\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: In bed now. A bit nervous about tomorrow :grimacing-face:\\
Night night, sleep well and I'll see you in the morning x x x x x x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just about to have a quick shower and I’ll be doing the same.\\

It should be fun. That’s what they say anyway.\\Night x x x x x x x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00011111-GIF-2024-02-25-06-35-42.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x\\
I am up and not crying and I think that's the best I could hope for :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\Did you sleep well?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: slept pretty well.\\
Sensing it might be a long day for a relatively short run.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yea, definitely feels like that\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Will all depend on the end of run faff. Getting bags back and lunch.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Leaving to get Cally now\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: On way to you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Outside\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm through :beaming-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done. I’m trying to find bag drop\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Me too\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: When did you come through?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Missed voice call, Tap to call back\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Home alright?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep, done a hydration tab and running a bath.\\
Well done today. You did really well.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you!\\
You did well too! And thank you for taking care of the journey and all.\\I'm just about to run a bath too\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Your welcome. Not sure if you were teasing or not but I did feel this morning that you were very annoyed at my journey planning.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I was teasing when I said we should have gone from Ruislip.\\
I was a bit stressed with the delay but that wasn't on you in any way, shape or form :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok. I could tell you were stressed from the delay.\\
When that does happen I feel I don’t react the way you want or need me to. I ether say the wrong thing or say nothing which don’t help.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: This might be a past thing I’m discovering\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh sweets. I really appreciate your help when I'm stressed, I really do. But it's on me to try to manage these feelings a little better, you don't have to take that on yourself. Just keep being your wonderful self\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh dear. Maybe technically our best photo together?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah let's not call it the best :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Only then :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We do need to start taking some photos together\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Agreed. I’m just rubbish at even remembering.\\
Andy D from the group seems great at taking them. Stuart and Doug are good.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well then we need to remember :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am so broken\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Drugs\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Third run of the year\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Third?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yes, the parkrun\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m ruined, so you’ve done really well.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was the bath?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Fibro broken only or I’ve run broken\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Grey :face-vomiting:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: But good\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Combination\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Literally just got out of the shower\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I was hurting before we even started so just completely finished myself\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Time to hunt for food. After finding cloths\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Were you extra broken from yesterday?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Or just extra stress broken because you know. You stress.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think stress is catching up with me\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, have you found the P45 or the missing paperwork\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I have the p45\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Need to scan it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Turn it around and send it the other way.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Or punch it square in the face\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Or maybe more helpfully, write it all down.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, just need to ride it out\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Suffering through is a plan as well.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Any thoughts on when we might see each other this week?\\
I’m busy tomorrow and Thursday. Thursday is the quiz if you fancied joining I can confirm timings.\\Art show at the weekend. Maybe we could do something Saturday evening but that is also the first race of the season that I’d like to watch.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I could pop by after school on Wednesday as we don't have a late finish? I have bookclub tomorrow and counselling on Tuesday. Could do Friday too. What time is the race on Saturday?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Wednesday works. Will you want dinner?\\
Not sure on timing for Saturday. The race is at 3pm which I’ll miss so I may have to suffer the highlights on CH4. I think 6 or 7\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: 7:50pm Saturday\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't worry about dinner for me - I might have to pop home to feed spud and shower if I'm dinnering :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
I can come to you on Saturday and then let you watch your race in peace after\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sounds good.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The steak from Friday made a good little stir fry\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah nice! Glad you managed to use it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm feeling too nauseous for dinner\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Because of running or something else.\\
Given the energy output today you should try and get something in.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Again I think combination of today and fibro.\\
I'm just having a tea and might have a banana before bed. Just really can't even think about eating\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Banana is at least something. Any yogurt?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No no yoghurt :pensive-face: need to do a food shop tomorrow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh my goooooooood :smiling-face-with-heart-eyes::smiling-face-with-heart-eyes::smiling-face-with-heart-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Boop that snoot\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I KNOW!!!!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I did manage to get myself in a bit of a state yesterday as I realised it has now been over 2 years since I lost Shadow and that I missed the day.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh sweets. I'm so sorry.\\
Please do share with me stuff like this if you'd want to\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was just an odd moment all at once while getting ready last night that I’d forgot the date but remembered it was February. Had to look it up. I’ve not quite done 2 years yet without a dog but will have be in the summer. Was just strange that I’ve been in this house longer without a dog than with.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sending the biggest hugs. I can't even imagine how hard that is\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The actual day itself is just the worst thing ever but also the very last kind thing you do.\\
It’s all very sad but Layla got very short changed. She should have had a lot longer and suffered a little needlessly for very little gain. She had a very aggressive cancer.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I wish I could do something to make it better :purple-heart:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :red-heart:\\
It’s just the cost of pet ownership. You live longer than they do.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't even want to think about it with the furry overlord. I'm already so worried about every sneeze\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The only thing I planned is that, assuming I could, I’d make myself be there the whole time. It’s all you can do.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Definitely\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've taken half a melatonin and got myself into bed. Hoping for some deep sleep to heal this broken nonsense of a body\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hope it works for you. Calm thoughts\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You have a nice lay in tomorrow :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I will :grinning-face:\\
8am alarm is set\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I hope you get some good rest and don't hurt too much tomorrow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night. Sleep well x x x x x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
Like your face.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I like all of you. Like reeeaaallly x\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x\\
I am truly broken :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\How are you feeling? I'm glad you managed to get some proper rest\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh dear, not as bad as the Sunday you woke at my place?\\
My right foot is knackered and I somehow still have a headache\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No, not as bad as that.\\
Oh is it the one with tighter laces?\\Loads of water today.\\What's your plan?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s something at least and I know that Sunday was mega bad.\\
Don’t think I can blame the laces just the impact of running.\\Today. Got shopping arriving, got to make some progress on uni stuff, going for a little walk at lunch and then Becky is coming over for dinner this evening.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes that one was mega bad.\\
Productive day ahead for you. Didn't realise Becky was coming over today. What are you making?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Making tomato pasta meatballs tonight.\\
Hopefully a productive day.\\Hope the children aren’t too feral\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh are the kids coming too?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh god no.\\
I meant your school kids.\\I’ve only met Becky’s kids once maybe twice.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: My house is a death trap for kids plus I don’t need or want them touching anything.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah right!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: When is easter holiday? Both of my modules have their break weeks on different weeks :man-facepalming:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no.\\
It's Fri 29 march to sun 14 April\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: When are your breaks?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: those 2 weeks :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: how and why they are not the same I have no idea\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: last year they were the same\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Will you be able to grab one day or not really?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: oh yeah, 1 or 2 days will be easy\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Would be nice to do something\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: \url{https://www.premierinn.com/gb/en/hotels/england/cheshire/chester/chester-central-south-east.html}\\
Really cheap for April 1st and not bad any other day of that week. We just need to solve the sleeping in the same room problem\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Jo is coming on the 2nd\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: not then then\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: If you work out what day works best for you we can look at booking.\\
But honestly I don't mind doing a day trip, that's what I would have done if I were going alone\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: we could do it as a day trip but that is 7 hours of driving. So 7 hours of sitting. Zoo is open 10-4:30 so not super crazy\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes but that 7 hours would be broken up with breaks and then a whole load of walking and then breaks.\\
I'm just worried that I won't sleep and then will be in bad bad way and we won't even be able to do the zoo\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is my fear as well. We can do the day trip. Alternative idea is that the hotel is for after the zoo\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Let's start with a day trip and see how I do?\\
In all honesty, I've been avoiding going away loads because of not knowing how fibro will react and I don't want to end up being a burden on someone who'd have to take care of me, and ruin a trip for myself\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I can understand that. We can do the day trip. All we are risking is a day and a bit of petrol. Separately need to test out how you can get comfortable sleeping in different places\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you.\\
We could try a sleepover at yours with me in the spare room?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I do like premier in beds because they are firmer tbh. But haven't stayed in one since everything got worse. We might need to work on the sound issues too :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: and the premier in seems to have a sofa bed as well. We can try the spare room as well. You can at least sit on it to see how that matress compares\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki we'll give it a go\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just got home. How was your day?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: long day for you?\\
Mines been ok, as always not quite as much work done as I would like. Had to fix a computer issue first. Went for a walk which was nice. Nothing super exciting. I am printing some guards to try and block out even more light in my room. Had it on my mind to try out\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: So long. And I've been so so cold all day. Like actual body shivers, and just moody too.\\
Sounds like a good day :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: where did you go for a walk?\\When is Becky coming over?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It has been cold today and no doubt a bit low on energy from yesterday. It was cold on the walk, I just went over to Hughenden to walk by the stream.\\
About 7:30. She is just at a body pump class. Will be a bit of a late dinner :face-screaming-in-fear:.\\Soup was good for lunch though.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hughenden is nice . Glad you managed to get out a little.\\
Hope you have a good time.\\We should arrange to do something with Becky. Would be nice to meet her\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, I was thinking the same. Will try and ask about it today.\\
Are you all set for book club?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not yet. I'm so tired. And I got another email saying to upload more stuff from a job 8 years ago\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: MORE STUFF, how much do they need?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I uploaded p45\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: if you have uploads a P45 and or payslip i'm not sure why or what more they need\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Those things\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: My interpretation of that is that you need to upload one not all.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yes\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But just to be safe I uploaded offer, first page of contract and a payslip :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm getting too nervous\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, that will definitely do.\\
Nervous about what?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You have shown all the info.\\
8 years is way too far back for me\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: These bloody checks\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And they haven't even sent an email to my hod yet\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And then the medical\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: For references? They’ll do these checks first would be my guess. They have at least 6 weeks to get it all done\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah for references.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: If they even bother but they might just send a letter to the school. They may never contact your HOD.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I want them to. It'll be glowing\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: They already offered you the job. They know how great you are.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know. I just want these things to go through so I know I definitely have a job come may :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you sent the email Michele suggested?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have not had a minute today\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you go to book club?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes just got back. How was dinner?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Dinner was good. Becky just left. The dog is mental.\\
Becky’s got a date on Wednesday she’s excited about.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ooh that's good! Hope it goes well for her :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I hope so. He’s not trip any flags yet.\\
This is the first one who hasn’t sent any overtly sexual texts before they met! I hadn’t realised all of her other dates had.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: How’s was book nerding?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aaaaah yeah, that's a big flag when they do\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Book nerding was very good. But I am now absolutely wiped\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I bet. It’s late for you.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: So very late :loudly-crying-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Super fast potter to bed then.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Working on it :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Do you have spin in the morning?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep, nice and early :man-facepalming:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Bedtime for you soon too then?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: At least I’m not so broken from yesterday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, I’ll go off in a bit\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: See if I can get 6.5 hours\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That is so little\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But I'm getting that probably\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :grimacing-face::crying-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Pottered all the way to bed now!\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x\\
I am feeling exactly like that gif :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\Did you get some good sleep?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ouch. Not a lot of sleeps for you.\\
I got some sleep.\\Will you have time for a nap later?\\Just thing. Very soon you’ll be able to nap during the day.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Think\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No I don't think nap is on the cards today. I've got a detention duty after school so will be late back.\\
Not even the daytime naps, it's the not having to get up at 5am that will be so nice!\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Urgh, stupid naughty children.\\
That no 5am will be brilliant as well AND naps\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's the positive spin I like :beaming-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What's your plan after spin?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Super rock and roll.\\
Sit, breakfast, shower work walk done. Maybe games in the evening. The order might change :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You got counselling session later?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Great plan!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup, 6.30 but I have some homework to do before. Do you have a tutorial today?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I need to triple check but don’t think I have any this week and maybe none next week. A bit of a break\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah nice! A few free evenings for you :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Little bit of rest yeah. Brain is never the best at 7pm.\\
Spin was rough but good. Good turn out as well. 9 people. I finally broke “my” bike, small victories.\\Hope the days goes well.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Glad spin was good!\\
How did you break "your" bike?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: The computer just stopped working. The levels on that bike have been different for a while. Did mean I had to move which is away from the AC.\\
Rearranged it all at the end so my spot has a new bike :grinning-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha, well done!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope your day is good too!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What time were you thinking of coming round tomorrow? I might have messed you up by saying I could go to the gym at 4:30\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I was thinking straight after work so about 4.30\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Knew I did it wrong. I’ll change it.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Who are you going with?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just going with Toria. I can go in the morning <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Quick q - Laura's car broke down yesterday and hillclimb won't have time to look at it until next week. Is your mechanic super good?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yes, MGRS\\
01494 534442\\They might be booked up as well but worth a try.\\Won’t hurt to say she got the number from me.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you. Passed it on\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: They should hopefully have a pool car as well. If they have the time this week.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: If MGRS can’t help then I’d try Full Circle, also up at Cressex or Just MOT’s\\
Both might be able to help.\\If the car won’t move does her road side assistance help?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think she has home breakdown on her policy\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That might at least get the car to what ever garage is available.\\
DO NOT use “the Marlow garage” which is behind MGRS.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've let her know\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No problem. Hopefully she can get it sorted and it’s just a busted gear linkage rather than anything worse\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Those noddles are pretty good. May have made it wrong as sauce is quite thin.\\
They are out of date.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh it's a soup rather than a sauce. I'm glad you liked them.\\
Of course they are :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone: I'm really not good at checking dry stuff\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s dry noddles so I’m not sure what is there to go out of date really.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Me neither that's why I never look.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I managed to get out of the det duty so normal finish\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That's good new. Gives you a bit more time at home before your session\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, I've got paperwork to do. And I got another email to upload a bill for DBS :upside-down-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How has your day been so far?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh like a utility bill or something? Hopefully there cannot be much left for you to upload.\\
Days been ok. Grinding away at some code. Its quite cool but the layout of the provided code is a bit clunky. Lots of scrolling. I might be trying a bit to hard but we will see. Trying to get it so I can hit go and the system will just churn and give me the results when I come back later. Will see if it works.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, fortunately I found a council tax bill. Everything else is electronic\\
That sounds complicated. Hope it works\\Did you get out for a walk?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also, this dweeb got the counseling session's time wrong.... It was at 4.30. was very surprised to get the call :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone::woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: doh. Not seen dweeb used in a while. Not sure you qualify. Did you miss your session then?\\
Yeah I got out for a walk. Its a good excuse to listen to my book. Not been able to find a dog though.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No I didn't. Just wasn't ready for it really. And it was a last one too\\
Ah nice! What book are you listening to?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Can you not reschedule?\\
Listening to "Sentenced to Troll". Its only ok. Taking forever to get going and not very funny. Its a LitRPG book that is meant to be similar to a book series I like. So far. It isn't\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh it's done now.\\
Ah I hate when that happens\\Hope it gets moving soon\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: oh, that's a real pain for you if they dont let you reschedule.\\
Whats the plan for the rest of the day then?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've uploaded the bill.\\
I am soooo hungry. I have been soooo hungry for two days now, can't fill the hole :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\What are you up to?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: well done.\\
Your probably still hungry from Sunday as you didn't eat much.\\Just trying to get this code up and running then i'll get dinner. Always think i'm 5 minutes away from finishing and then something happens\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The beauty of code :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah probably, but just feels like I'm too hungry if you know what I mean\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: stress hungry\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Could be\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Fingers crossed for the code for you :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Had to give up and try again tomorrow. Went straight from “think I’m nearly done” down to\\
“Nothing is working it’s all broken”\\Have you eaten?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh hope it works tomorrow! It might just be a case of too much tinkering.\\
Yes I have. Can't wait to go to bed :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah I think I just need to reset and look again. Just a pain as it’s taken ages.\\
Are you waiting for something to go to bed?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah, I had to do at least one load of laundry because I'm starting to have no clothes\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh no, that’s not a quick process. Although you not having much to wear isn’t the worst thing :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, I was sure you'd approve of that. But as much as I like my cosies I can't turn into the hobo girlfriend...\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: ...just yet\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I was more thinking underwear over  hobo cloths :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahahah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm even running out of that\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Need to buy more then\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've got loads :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: just didn't have a chance to do laundry this weekend\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: \#sexytalk\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not really much time this weekend\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No. I'm hoping to catch up on some bits soon\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm in bed :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: My code might have been annoying me so I may have stayed up after playing games to try and fix it. I think I got enough of it done.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x\\
I definitely slept longer :grinning-face-with-sweat:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, I did think you were up late. Glad it's somewhat fixed\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is longer. Not much deep though. How are you feeling?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Fortunately I don’t have a class this morning so I could push through last night. Not sure how good the results are that I’ve got but I think it’s enough to write the report. A shame really as you could spend a lot longer and try to make it all work a bit better.\\
Definitely feel sorry for the non code students. Ignoring the science the code is hecka confusing and bloated.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Tbh honest, not great but pushing through\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: At least you've got an advantage with the code :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What have you got planned for today?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You still planning on popping in later?\\
Yeah and it is a big advantage. Will be my feedback to the course that people really need more coding experience. Especially if they want to do any of this professionally.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Today is pretty normal.\\
About to hunt for food. Work, a walk, which has been fun to do this week. Then I get to see you for a bit.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh and I need to give meter reading to my energy supplier. Proper crazy stuff\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes. Really fancy seeing you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sounds like a good day. I'm quite jealous of your walks to be honest\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I need to do that too. Look at us both living a rock'n'roll life\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Won’t be too long until you can have walks during work time.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 2 months :grimacing-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Whoop. 6 weeks really with the holiday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: 3 sets of your 2 week time table. Will fly, hopefully.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Scary\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Exciting\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just those checks now :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s just paperwork. That will all be fine\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll get excited soon. I'm just sad about the ending of things\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And that part of the process.\\
Just because you’re sad to leave doesn’t mean it not a good idea.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You can still miss the good parts of a bad thing\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know. I'll definitely miss the dept and (some) kids\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: But you’ll get new people to work with who should be good\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes yes. I know you are right\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You can still be sad but make sure to balance it with the upcoming good stuff as well.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I will, promise\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's work going?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Erm, procrastination has taken over. Just making a tea now.\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Do the games ever go well?? :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\

That’s a good chart for you.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also I've discovered why I've been so hungry and emotional the last few days :face-with-rolling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh yeah?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00011440-GIF-2024-02-29-06-25-45.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I came on :upside-down-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I was trying to find a gif but couldn't :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, I thought that what you were going to say but it is well established that men aren’t allowed to ask such things\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It is not established and you can absolutely ask :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The internet aggressively disagrees :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Internet is wrong\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Never :grinning-face:\\
I’m guessing this one took you by surprise then?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha yes. Honestly don't know what's been happening over the last 3 months - it's massively all over the place\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you forget a pill?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No I didn't\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's part of my morning vitamins\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It could be the stress\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Most likely. Almost impressive that your stress beats drugs\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly, I haven't had it this all over the place for absolute years. It's so weird\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Something to add to the list to talk to the doctor about\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes. That list is never ending\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Maybe ever evolving is a better way to think\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Maybe :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was spin?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was ok. Lots of people, which is good. Just odd being half hour.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah it seems short\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00011462-GIF-2024-02-29-08-03-17.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What time is your sesh with hannah\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: 3:30\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha, perfect\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Should work out just in time. Gym session, eat, pub quiz\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Perfect plan. Do you know the topic of the quiz?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Nope, different rounds with different topics\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Is it the whole fam?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No, just me and parents and who ever they normally go with. They are a player down this week. So I’ve got to try and cover something.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What’s your plans for later?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've got a quick call with the counseling service at 4.30 and then I think I just want to potter a little, cook a proper dinner and read a book. Seems like I haven't stopped this week yet\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sounds like a good evening. Book nerd. :face-with-monocle:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Alright, robot nerd :nerd-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Shame it's on a weekday, I would have loved to come\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Maybe not the next one but the one after will probably be once you have new job and you’d be WFH Friday\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That would be nice\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They are cute. Which ones are you going to do\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Got 3 of these\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: More of these cos they are small and cute\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Maybe one of these in purple. Not amazed by it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And will do some more eggs in different colours.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that sounds good! Do you have anything else you'll be selling?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ve got some light pulls and a couple of bottle stoppers still to sell and a few odds that someone might buy eventually. Would be great if someone bought the rolling pin.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: My table will be a nice evolution. Wood - epoxy - printed\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll see if I fancy something :grinning-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: There is a lot of us. You might find something.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Any thoughts on what time you might be there?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your morning been?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Professional academics have issues clearly explaining instructions!\\
Been trying to understand my mini astrophysics projects. They have made it more complicated than it really is once you understand it.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: How about yours?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did you manage it?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Full teaching, then two meetings. Deputy head pulled me aside to say how gutted she was. And then one of my hardest cases from my old form turned up to see me and say hello and she's doing so well and it was just so cute\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think I understand. Just waiting for confirmation from my tutor. Now can go back to the cosmology project.\\
Urgh, meetings.\\That’s nice on both counts. Much nicer to be missed than not.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah good. Hopefully it will be reasonably straightforward to do.\\
Yes, they are all making it very hard to be excited about next steps :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh yeah. It’s super duper straight forward :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:. Although now I have to write it up\\
That is a good thing and you can still be exciting knowing you made a difference and will be missed. Just shows how lucky your new team is going to be to have someone so amazing join them.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha. But you know, straightforward within means\\
I know it's a good thing. But I can't cry at work constantly :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You’ll get too dehydrated if you do.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You back home now.\\
Just done my session with Hannah. Forgot how short hour session are. Can still overhead press 60kg so that’s good.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am. Will have a little snooze because I am exhausted and my face is twitching like crazy.\\
Oh well done!! How was the session? How's Hannah?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: So it’s twitchy face instead of “like your face” (which I do)\\
Session was good. Much easier when someone else plans it all.\\Hannah is really good. She’s lost 12kg:rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\From her story the whole things wasn’t even that big of a deal other than both of them being slightly annoyed it all happened during the night \/ early morning.\\Baby already in a bit of a routine. Next week will be the next test as Richard goes back to work.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: She's already lost weight?!? Oh wow, they are making it look easy.\\
Glad you had a good session. When is the quiz? And did you find out where it is?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well the getting the baby out helps drop the weight.\\
Quiz is at 7:30. Just cooking dinner then will go. It’s at the beach tree pub.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you napped?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It wasn't 12kgs though!!\\
What are you cooking?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I have but hasn't made much difference :confused-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Had a chilli in the freezer.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah nice!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Didn’t nap long enough?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Half hour\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It is leftovers from your definition\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I couldn't really do more because then I won't sleep later\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha. It is!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What book are you reading tonight? Murder or filth?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Neither\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's called Betrayals.. some kind of a fiction. Still not sure what's going on and I need to get a move on because the bookclub is on Monday\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope the quiz is good. Let me know if you get stuck :winking-face: I am brilliant at quizzes\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m pretty sure we won’t be allowed to use our phones. Just getting ready to leave now.\\
Based on that I should probably say good night early.\\Night x x x x x x.\\Miss your face. Like you a  lot and you’re really pretty.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well, booo :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Hope you have a good time, say hello to mum and dad for me.\\I miss your face too. I like you a lot lot. You're very handsome too :red-heart:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: \url{https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGeDK21wQ/}\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: In bed now. Hope the quiz was good.\\
Night x x x x x x x x x x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: This is what a sail boat is needed for\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Quiz was quite shit. I knew the answer to one question out of 60.\\

\picturechapter{March}{sectionImage_5.png}
\section*{Friday $01\textsuperscript{st}$}
Unbelievably loud to the point it hurt and overall very slow.\\Have to try these things.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning! x x x x x x\\
Well that is a glowing review :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\What did your parents think?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Morning x x x x x x x\\
They thought similar.\\First round was all Shakespeare, second round was all which animal is on what footballs team badge. Didn’t even do well on the science round.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: How are you feeling this morning\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You need me on your team!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not great at all. The drive in was absolutely horrendous, even had a quick aquaplane and I'm just hurting loads\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What's your plan for today? No gym this morning?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The other quiz is meant to be much better which is on the last day of term….\\
OH! Aquaplane on the motorway. Either way never fun. I can hear how bad the rain is.\\Plan for today. Survive the dog :grinning-face: mum is coming over about 10.\\Maybe a dog walk this afternoon but at this rate it’s going to be road only as the park will be a disgrace. Which is a shame. Glad I’m not doing parkrun this week.\\Got to try and do some work but I’m pretty comfortable this week. Get the printing making more stuff and pack everything for tomorrow. Make some more pizza bases.\\Hurting from anything specific or just the joy of fibro and no sleep\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Missed the gym, back is still a little twinged and knackered from the late quiz and I think my late night working on Tuesday.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yes, when is Becky dropping the dog off?\\
Definitely try to get out for a walk, even of it's still all manky.\\Fibro hurting and fibro exhausted. Ran out of spoons back on Tuesday. I'm just so sick of it. I was thinking about doing gym today but I can barely function. Will try tomorrow morning\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Should be getting the dog in 20 minutes.\\
:smiling-face-with-hearts::smiling-face-with-hearts::smiling-face-with-hearts:\\Gym in the morning is a good idea instead of soggy parkrun\\This is the motivation for changing jobs. Then you can hopefully have a spoon left by the end of the week.\\You were almost :grinning-face-with-sweat: a real human in December.\\You got this. 6 hours and it’s done.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, I don't even remember December anymore. But I know that even though I wasn't well, I wasn't this bad\\
Doggy spam later please\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Correct, you were sick but had a lot more energy than you’ve had the last 3 or 4 weeks.\\
As in dog pics?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Awww puppy\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's puppy?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah\\
So jealous\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And how are you?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m on. Weirdly timed question. How are you?\\
I’m annoyed I hurt my back in the first place and that it still hurts a bit. Otherwise ok. Feel on track with uni for the first time in ages and need to get my robot built and hopefully working. Really want the art show to not be a complete waste of time but we will see. Going to be a tiring weekend I think.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What are you on? I don't think I'm getting the first two sentences <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Can I help with the back somehow? I'm guessing the gunning didn't do much?\\
It's good you're feeling in track with uni. Hopefully that means you can dedicate some time to the robot building over the next two weeks.\\Yeah, I really hope there will be some turnout.\\What can I do to make it better?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Should have said “I’m ok”.\\
I just thought it was an odd time to ask me that question. Like you might have spiralled on something.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no, I was just asking how you were doing while the dog was having the time of it's life :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not sure there is anything to do about the back. It is already getting better. Just go to calm down the heavy weight for a little bit longer.\\
Also not sure anything can be done with the art show unless you can get more people to attend and spend money.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh, that makes sense.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Poppy seems to be enjoying herself. Just did a short road walk. To muddy for the park. After barking at my mum for 5 minutes she just laid back down super chill again. Now she is on the sofa she seems very content\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aw I'm glad she's having a good puppy day\\
How was mum's visit?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Long :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: but good. She was here for over 3 hours.\\
They are going to be at the show around 2 pm tomorrow\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You back home?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: <attached: 00011564-AUDIO-2024-03-01-15-57-27.opus>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: At least the week is done now and you might be able to switch off for a day.\\
Bath?\\Not sure on the rest of the day. Maybe a smidge of work, need to collate and pack up stuff for tomorrow.\\Just watching qualifying for the F1. Don’t normally but might as well for the first one of the season.\\Got to make pizza bases and then cook a pizza. Saves me getting Donald’s. Might play some games later or just watch something.\\May go absolutely mental and have a beer\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, such a good photo\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes it is done.\\
Well it sounds like an absolutely rock'n'roll evening for you.\\I'm going to rock it in Sainsbury's\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00011569-GIF-2024-03-01-16-23-04.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm pottering :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Do you still have those bake at home baguettes?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yes\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I just got another email asking me to provide HMRC docs for my current job\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: As in your current p45?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Like p60s and contract letter etc\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly :grinning-face-with-sweat:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That seems mega extreme\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Are these automated email?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's a no reply email\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: External company as well.\\
Keep it simple. Do you have what’s it’s asking for?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes I do\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is easy then. Just send it. Maybe email who ever you’ve been in contact with at J\&J and see what they say. All seems very piecemeal to me\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What would I say?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Didn’t you already provide a pay slip for current job?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes I did\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll do the p60s\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Upload the last p45\/60 (I always get confused which is which). I don’t know why they would want previous contact letters\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's for the whole duration from 1 July 2018\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The p60’s and payslips prove employment\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's one of these type of thing\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Could have just asked for everything at the same time :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: If you have the p60 then use that.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s what’s odd\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I will do that\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: After you’ve done that maybe ask J\&J if everything is ok as you keep getting asked for more and more documents.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good idea\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Given it’s an external company J\&J might be able to get more info.\\
Seems they have asked for an extreme amount of info.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Always fun to get last minutes Friday stuff as well. Like someone just remembered they should have done something days ago\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah. I mean the j\&j contact won't be in until Monday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You deleted this message.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What did you delete?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Send it over the weekend to J\&J if you find a spoon.\\
At least if you upload the P60 it’s done\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll upload the stuff tonight\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: An auto correct nightmare\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I wish they provided some info\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Would be helpful\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well this took bloody ages\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Last time they said to black out all pay \/money info so spent too much time doing that\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: urgh, that's a pain. To late now but you could have used my scanner tomorrow to speed it all up.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No don't worry. I've got them all electronically anyway. But had to get 2018\/2019 and this year from HMRC so that was a faff and then needed to black out the other bits on pdfs\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: At least you got it done. Well done\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Want to bet how much more am I going to get asked for?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No bet :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
“Please upload your secondary schools teachers personal recommendation”\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They have her email. They'd better do that\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I meant from when you were at school. As a joke for the more stuff they will need.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh god :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think I'll cook the goulash tomorrow. It's too late now\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good plan. We can change dinner if you want.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No no. I've got everything for it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok. You cooking it at yours or mine?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll cook it here in the morning\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It takes a few hours\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you eaten?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I have :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: had a fishcake.\\
How was pizza?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Pizza was good. Always a bit  better with fresh dough.\\
Poppy has gone now.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aww, did you have a good day with her?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was nice. She was asleep most of the time and it did feel odd when I went upstairs. You do wonder what is happening (nothing).\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah. She looked super chilled\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm already in bed. So wiped\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I thought you might be. Have you reset your alarm and told the fur bag that’s it the weekend.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've set my alarm actually. I want to go to the gym and then have a nap :beaming-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Btw parkrun got cancelled again so you're not missing anything\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ve seen\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Everyone is just a mud bath\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Everywhere even\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I need better weather now. This is really not helping\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: At this point the weather can really only improve\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Although I am expecting cold and snow before heat\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nooooooooooo\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Maybe it will be nice for Easter\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully. At least for the zoo day\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What have you been up to?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, will have to go weather nerd for it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Watched qualifying, made pizza, smidge of work, printed things and sitting.\\
Need to sort out my stuff for tomorrow.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully you can get that done quickly\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to try some sleep\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good luck.\\
Night x x x x x x x x x\\Drugs?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night. Sleep well\\

I woke up at 4 and just could not get back to sleep for ages.\\How are you? Ready for today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh booo. That’s no fun. Maybe you forgot to tell your brain it’s the weekend :grinning-face:.\\
I’m ok. Bit tired and not ready at all. I mean, I’m all packed. Just really not excited about it at all. Which I should be. Hopefully it’s worth while but at the moment it feels like it just going to be a hassle. We will see.\\What are your plans for the day now?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: C'mon! A little bit of positive thinking :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
When are you heading over there?\\Btw, is there parking? I've looked on Google maps and it doesn't seem it.\\Going to the gym in a minute, then cook, then come see you, then nap, then dinner with this man I'm into\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know, need to be more positive.\\
Aiming for 9 but feel I’m going to miss it as I need to shower and eat breakfast.\\Yes there is parking. There is an 18 story car park with a single track road straight to the roof that you can park on. :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\Just past the church on the right is the community center. You can park there.\\Gym, cooking and art show before the nap!\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Get a move on then :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: you can do it!\\
Don't tease me on this. You know it's my brain\\Well we'll see how far down the list I get\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki, thank you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I thought you were aiming for gym cooking nap art show nap.\\
DOUBLE nap. :sleeping-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, I don't know if I'll have time for that\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Shower!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How was the gym? Didn’t break yourself in half I hope\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nice!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Almost :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It was hard but good to be nack\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Nack as on knackered or back :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Back :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Cooking now?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes yes. Hopefully I won't fuck it up. I haven't made it in like 3 years\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No pressure. If it all goes wrong Mc Donald’s or hello boss to the rescue\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know. Just want it to work out\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: When does the fair open?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Technically in 10 minutes but we wouldn’t turn people away\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Feels like I’ve been here hours\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah, did you manage to leave yours on time?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just about, slight delay due to going to Tesco.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Do you need me to bring you anything?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Don’t think so. Just your pretty self.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That might be a tall order :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well you are short\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good things come in small packages :woman-shrugging-light-skin-tone:\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: You could always try and get Katie or someone to come up.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Everyone is busy\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Useless\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You’ll just have to survive on your own\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I will\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: Of course it is :man-facepalming:\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Will have to be\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I do have a huge pot if that helps. Just don’t look at the kitchen counter\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't worry, but thank you :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: FYI it’s cold in the church\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good to know! I'm just getting dressed\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Do you have tea and stuff?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You were cooking naked :eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Stuff = cake\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: We have tea, coffee and cakes\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good! I'll be leaving in a minute\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: See you in a bit\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Your parents are so lovely.\\
Hope I made a halfway decent first impression :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also now stressing about how I shouldn't mentioned that you snore..was that inappropriate?!? :grimacing-face::grimacing-face::grimacing-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You made a good impression. Both separate told me how nice you are.\\
They are aware I snore and I told them that story anyway.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Phew. Now I can nap :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You should have napped already :man-facepalming:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Shall we do two?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s what I was thinking\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Can always save some.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I managed to have like 15mins snooze\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Will shower, get stuff ready and head over\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Can I come in my cosies?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is not a lot of snooze.\\
Of course you can.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll put the bread in.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Bring an extra top for spills :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahahah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No spills!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Spills only happen when wearing white\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm so cold :cold-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You could shower at mine? If that helps at all.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Full power to the heating and close the windows\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What else do I need to prep for food?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nothing else\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope you'll like it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Me too\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s a no to the shower I’m assuming\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sorry, no, I'll shower here :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok, see you in a bit.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Need to sort Dave out to install the new shower and taps.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes yes. I need to order the other bits\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The screen and panel don’t need to be him though so we can disconnect those tasks. I think. Then paint, screen and panel can be a whole job as then paint won’t get on the new screen or panel.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good point\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Always :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Leaving in 2\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thank you for dinner. Really enjoyed it.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You're so welcome. I'm glad you enjoyed it.\\
Enjoy the zoom zoom wiggly wiggly\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00011748-GIF-2024-03-02-21-16-16.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm in bed with half a melatonin. Hope the race is good.\\
Night night x x x x x x x x x x\\Like you massive\\I'm not going anywhere\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night x x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
Hope you sleep better.\\Why only half?\\I like you a scary amount.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't know :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: there was a half at the top of the pile :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That logic actually makes sense\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: A bit at least\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night xx\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night x x x x x x x x x x x\\
\section*{Sunday $03\textsuperscript{rd}$}
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00011757-GIF-2024-03-03-08-03-40.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x\\
Yeah it hasn't been great at all. I think I'm so exhausted that my body doesn't know what to do.\\Did you sleep okay?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Slept pretty well. I was in bed before 10:30.\\
You should be able to proper  nap today?\\Lesson learned about the drugs, full ones on a weekend.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: \url{https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGeUyWksu/}\\
Well this makes sense\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Erm! I’m pretty sure I would be able to talk or stand up if I was awake for 72 hours. That does explain things.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That you would be?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Wouldn’t :man-facepalming:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aaaaah :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s bad enough if get less than 6 hours a night\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: When are you off to the show?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Probably leaving here at 10.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've had a little more snooze.\\
Hope today goes well :smiling-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I thought you might have fallen back asleep.\\
Managed to forget to buy lunch :man-facepalming: not very busy yet but we will see.\\Like your face x x x\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no! What are you going to have?\\
I like your face too x x x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ve got jerky and cake plus will see what the shop down the roads has.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh at least that.\\
I'm really not feeling well today, otherwise I'd offer to bring you something\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s ok. Worse than yesterday?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s the bread :baguette-bread:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah, woke up really foggy, fatigued and hurty\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s crap. A day of very little for you then\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've got to push through at least with the flat. But very slow\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well you said about washing and some hovering. Save the spoons :grinning-face:\\
Anything I could do to help on my way home?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The stress of messy flat and having nothing to wear takes away spoons. I'll do everything slowly.\\
Thank you :smiling-face-with-hearts: hopefully I'll be alright\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I can easily pick up a bag of tumble dryable washing to have done by the time you finish school tomorrow. Rather than having to try and get 3 loads done.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Although if you like me it’s the actually putting the cloths away that requires any energy\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you. I'll see how many I'll get through\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: My washing machine leaked.... Had to pull it out and clean it all. The pipe that the machine pipe goes into overflowed. :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone::woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone::woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also, I'm going to sign up to next year's winter run\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: When it rains it pours. Is it obvious why it leaked?\\
I have got a snake thingy if the pipe is blocked\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I was going to as well.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I saw it coming out. I've sorted it and put another load on and waiting to see what happens.\\
I've got a drain unblocker so will run it through\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I guess on the plus side you wanted to clean under the washing machine\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Definitely did that\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Does the pipe need fixing in some way so it doesn’t come out again?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It didn't come out. I saw the water coming out\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It joins to the kitchen sink one\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: OH, have you run a full load or just a rinse to see if it works\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well it happened in the middle of the last one and I finished it without issue so I guess we'll see\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I assume the sink is draining fine?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Very strange\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Maybe not the fastest but the usual standard\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I guess just see how this load goes.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Definitely didn't need this today :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Definitely. Not the best way to start your week.\\
You got any late nights this week? Parents evening?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Definitely not fixed. Flooded again\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Badly like all the water is coming out or like an overflow spill?\\
If you fill the sink full and then unplug what’s it like.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you washed enough to get you through the next couple of days?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Came and kitchen had water half way through\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I guess that’s the first rinse cycle\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done. You should be able to unscrew the U bend and will see if it’s blocked at all.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Or if you can leave it I can help you look today but tomorrow would be better\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You need a dog towel  but yes. Mop first\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Washing machines never misbehave on a day you have the time to resolve.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sure you have but if the machine is running you’ll have to secure this somehow as I suspect when it tried to pump water out it will fly out of the sink\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've had a look and the ubend  is clear\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But when it was going into the sink it wasn't draining as fast so had to stop it to let it drain before more flood so it must be somewhere down the pipe\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s a shame it’s not the u bend you can access.\\
Do you have white vinegar and baking soda?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did it nearly make your sink overflow then? I didn’t realise they used that much water\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Being delivered as we speak. Ordered during the week\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I do have a drain cleaner\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: A slow blockages is such a pain.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm just hoping none of the water went downstairs\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Can you do a test. Fill the sink. Drain it. Then try the cleaner and repeat. Just so you know if anything is getting better\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Will do\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Given you noticed it straight away and cleaned it I’d be suprised.\\
Do you know downstairs? Could let them know.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not really\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The sink is draining super slow\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Messy but you could tape a bin bag to the wall under the bend behind the washing machine. Just to make sure any water is pushed into the room rather than the gap between floor and wall.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: At least you’ll know if it’s fixed.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m guessing this is since yesterday?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What about bathroom sink? Same or slower than normal\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I mean the sink has never been great but I've never had an issue with the washing machine\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’d start with a kettle of just boiled water. Then try the drain cleaner\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah will do that when the machine finishes\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's the fair?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: SLOW\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Boooo\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have sold a couple of bits but maybe it would be better just to go mad and do the one day.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: A few of the artists acted like mer cats when I said you did crochet :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah good that you sold some bits\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha. Why?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: More and different things for us to sell\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Soo, get making :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Tucked?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Or fucked\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah. I only make winter bits at the moment. I'll have to get into those animals\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Or stuck\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: This\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: My next show is probably the Xmas one. So that will work.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So you need the not draining unblock stuff.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Or is it now just super slow drain.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Stupid plumbing\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll have stuff by then\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not really draining and stinks\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I do have a plunger\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not that it immediately helps\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Me too\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am fully stocked with tools don't worry :winking-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00011861-GIF-2024-03-03-14-34-17.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Already done. That's why it stinks ,:rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Most people I know don’t have any tools\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I have pretty much everything - basics wise\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Has plunging not helped then?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Very slow drain. Just waiting for it to go and then will flush out with hot - drain cleaner - hot\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What about the bathroom sink?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just trying it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That will at least say where the block might be.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Absolutely fine. Drains very fast\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So from kitchen to main drain then.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: There was one when I first moved in but I had that bit replaced\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What was replaced?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Bit of a pipe. Because no one lived here for a while he couldn't clear it so just replaced it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The plumber\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just see what the chemicals do and go from there\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Will do\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ve got a snake thingy we can try if needed. I’d guess maybe kitchen stuff mixed with hair from the washing machine\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Probably\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah the joys of homeownership\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: SO\\
MUCH\\FUN\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: This was not my plan :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: At least 2 loads of washing done?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Bathroom is half way done. Not hoovered. Not changed bedding\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: AND cleaned under the washing machine\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 1 and half\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hover while waiting for sink?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No.. hoovering last. Them's the rules :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00011891-GIF-2024-03-03-14-46-53.mp4>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Obviously. That in no way adds any stress :face-with-rolling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's my process\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Do you want help changing the bed? I could then take it away for washing\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: But you’d have to abandon that job from your process and move on :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you. I'll be okay. I'm a champion - 10mins all in all. But I might have to take you up on the washing later if the washing machine packs it in\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well it’s not your washing machine that has issues. Just the drain. Once the sink drains properly you should be fine.\\
Once ready I’d run a rinse first just to check. Then it will just be clean water if something happens\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully it fixes itself\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: A house problem. Never.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's draining\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Because you did something to fix it or you stopped looking at it and the flat is playing tricks\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah. The drain cleaner worked I think\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Nice\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Drains better than it has before or just not blocked\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Half way between the two\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: More chemicals then?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I need to order some\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Probably the slow one and the foam ones\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah got both\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: When is it arriving? I’ve added some stuff for my shopping tomorrow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Tomorrow :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Washing load finally finished\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Woo hoo\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Can continue with the rest\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you to listening to my moans and offering advice :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Does your process not allow you to do something while the washing machine is running or you just holding the pipe\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Holding the pipe :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: If I wasn’t at the show I’d I’ve come over with tools to try and help\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know you would have. I still appreciate the long distance support :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've filled the sink and it drained reasonably fast. But I haven't reconnected the machine\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Given the issue is clearly after the sink and your machine connects to the sink you should be fine to put the machine back together (if you want to)\\
Then just clear the sink. And test with a rinse\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Once you get more unblock stuff\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've pushed it back in now. It's a thing for another day :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Should be leaving soonish. Do you need me to drop in to help with anything?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you sweets. I'm just finishing with the bed and will hoover. And then shower, I'm disgusting after today :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: and I managed to cut up my hands with the washing machine.\\
You need to put your feet up and rest. You've had a big weekend :smiling-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh you wally. Really not been the best day for you. Hope you can relax now\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly, what a shit Sunday :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: AND home.\\
So nice to see everyone but it is a long hard way to make £100\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Can at least put my joggers on\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm glad you're home, feet up now and get some food into you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It is! I guess you do it for the experience rather than profit\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is what we say when we don’t make any money :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm ready to be a crafter\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The trick is to already have made your money.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I'm not there\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: But it can be done. I suspect you’d be really good at it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The sales bit. Getting it all online. Multiple sales points\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll have to have something to display first :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have you eaten?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Nice,\\
Not eaten yet. Playing a few games.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope they are relaxing :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Partially and we just finally won a game.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Woooo hooo\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Goulash was good.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: I'm glad you liked it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s good.\\
Did the bath help at all?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Little. Just doing my nails\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have you had some rest?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: A little. Actual good games today with possible the craziest win we have ever had. So that was fun. Just had food. Now got my wine and just watching B99. Probably going to be an early bed and the house is more of a mess than normal.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's good!! Glad you had fun.\\
House can wait til tomorrow, just rest\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I wonder if someone else could take the same advice :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Shhh, don't bring this into it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :grinning-face:. You in bed yet?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No, still the bloody nails. This is taking too long.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Why so long? Do you need a UV lamp\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Actually no. It's this new thing I'm trying that doesn't need a UV lamp but stays on as long. Dipping powder. But because I'm doing it for a first time I have to keep checking the steps and videos so it's taking an age\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh, how much longer do you have?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Prob half hour\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh dear. It really has been a bad Sunday\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I have to laugh otherwise\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I mean, you do have to laugh.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: “Sorry I can’t come into work today”\\
“Oh why that’s”\\“I started painting my nails and it’s 4am and I’m 19 you tube videos deep and it’s all a mess”\\“Take the day. I understand”\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: At least it's my early day\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: As in you can go home early?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup no last period\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Very nice\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Straight home and straight to bed for a nap for you then. No pottering or nothing.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha most probably\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Only probably?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You never know with me :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But I am in bed!!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I can guess things.\\
Finally :grinning-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope you sleep well tonight.\\
Night night x x x x x x x x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You too.\\
Night x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: <attached: 00011983-GIF-2024-03-03-21-47-23.mp4>\\

I really like you.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You know it!\\
\section*{Monday $04\textsuperscript{th}$}
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00011986-GIF-2024-03-04-06-02-54.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x\\
I'm up and not crying (just about).\\How did you sleep?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s a good start.\\
I slept :grinning-face:  nothing special. Should have gone to bed earlier probably. Will try again later.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah. Well I'm glad you slept\\
Do you know who the instructor is today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: No idea, she is new. So will be fun to see what we do. Might get absolutely ruined. I’ve got Hannah at 11 as well.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ooh that's close together\\
Are you back to normal schedule with Hannah?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: In theory. Back to normal this week. So that’s good.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah that's good!\\
Do you have tutorials this week?\\We haven't talked about time together this week\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have one tomorrow 7-8 and that it for this week.\\
Your out Friday Saturday? And a parents evening?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I have parents evening tomorrow , oasiz on Friday and the spa Saturday. I could come after work on Wednesday and after the spa? Will we go to your mum's on Sunday?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Rough start to your week.\\
Directedtime on Wednesday?\\Bit otherwise sounds good\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll check for Sunday but didn’t you already agree :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes but I should be able to leave earlier on Wednesday\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: your mum mentioned it and I said that would be nice. You'll have to confirm :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh that’s confirmed then :face-with-tears-of-joy: I’ll get the time\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah, okay\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope spin is good. Enjoy x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Using PT speak spin was good.\\
According to the watch it’s the best spin class ever. 833kcal\\Good instructor. Nice to have routines to the music. She is super high energy and cheerful\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah brilliant! Glad it was a good class.\\
Even though, I don't know how I'd cope with super high energy and cheerful on a Monday morning\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've sent the email to the contact at j\&j\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s odd having that much high energy but it does lift the room.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done, this is to check on your background checks? <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah, just asked if everything was going according to plan\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good to check in.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully I'll hear something back\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What's the plan for today?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Shower, breakfast, sit, Hannah, lunch, work, cry, work, dinner, games, done.\\
I think.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You are so romantic with your paired answers :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good plan. But why we crying?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The crying is a joke.\\
Look at the work.\\OMG it’s hard :crying-face: and continue\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aw you cutie. Getting me all the corrosive chemicals\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s what all girls want :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you. Mines arriving today\/tomorrow. I ordered the same\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think I need one for my shower but if you need as well I have.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Another boring thing to have for when you need\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Parking at the gym is insane\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I always have one, which was great for yesterday\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Why???\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No idea just a full car park and the gym was mental. WTF do these people do. Does no one have a job.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's bizarre. 11am on a Monday is a weird time for gym\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Very odd for not to be so busy.\\
Did you want any help later today with sink \/ washing machine?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm not going to deal with it today. I just need a quiet time. I got precisely 0 rest yesterday and am definitely feeling it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That what I thought but wanted to offer. Did the bath not count at all or was it just a bath full of stress\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Btw heard back from my email. They contacted the main school office for references rather than the bloody LM who's name and direct email I provided\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah it didn't really help to be honest\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I thought they might do that. Probably to get the HR reference which is normally 2 lines long\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: So I outed myself to the office ladies because I had to check where the bloody email went\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, thought they would have know already.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But the ad went out this morning so doesn't really matter\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you get anything else for j\&j? Is the background check complete\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think so\\
I didn't get anything else\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s good. No extra news is good news for that part\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also they contacted the school on 27,28 and 29 and school still hasn't provided anything\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sounds about right based on my responses rates for academic administration offices\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Grrrrrr\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was your sesh with hannah?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's probably why they asked for the extra stuff on Friday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Maybe but as that’s an external company might be disconnected\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good, arms are dead now and I’m knackered. No point it being easy\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah glad it was good. Back to the routine. When's your next one?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hannah again on Friday. Spin tomorrow and Thursday and after spin Thursday planning a bit of a gym session.\\
Can’t do the YPOM run tomorrow because of uni but will park run and if it stays nice will walk each day this week.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Fully back to the routine. Blenheim in 3 months. Got to add some swims somewhere\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Busy busy week.\\
Yeah I won't be able to do the run tomorrow either and no parkrun on Saturday for me. Don't even know when I'll be able to do gym this week, probably just Sunday\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Once it gets a bit warmer I can't wait to go back to westhorpe\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sundays a good goal for the gym. Focus on some rest as tomorrow and Wednesdays will suck for you.\\
Yes to westhorpe but it does need to be a bit warmer and in the summer we can go paddle boarding\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You have to pay to paddle board there no? Depends how much is a river licence because then we could just do Marlow :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You do have to pay. I don’t remember it being much for the hour.\\
Not sure about a river license just you’d need a board. I’d rather drink the lake water than the river water though. As I will fall in.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's like £10+ an hour if I remember right. We went to taplow last June and it was brill and free.\\
Yeah you do need waterways licence on the Thames\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Chased up the Head's PA so will do the reference today\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s not a bad price. How was taplow free\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We went up stream from the paying bit :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: But where did the board come from\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nicky\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahhh\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Now it makes sense\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I was very confused because I don’t have a board and I’m pretty sure I would have seen one in your flat if you had one\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh mine's a magic one :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'd love to have a board but there is absolutely no space to put it. That's why I don't have a bike\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Does the flat not have bike parking? Have you seen where my bike is? They can go on the walk.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: My flat doesn't have bins\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You back home yet?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: <attached: 00012070-AUDIO-2024-03-04-14-17-30.opus>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Enjoy the little bit of extra time. Straight to bed for you for nap!\\
No messing.\\I have lunched but not yet made it to work. About to head up to see if what the brain can do.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just parked up. Hope work goes well. Have you been for a walk?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not today, which is a shame but think I've done enough workout for today\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah you've done loads today\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00012075-GIF-2024-03-04-14-49-22.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Getting there\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good nap?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It was a nap\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: If I didn't need to get up tomorrow I'd definitely have much more\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's work going?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Slow because i'm at the point of having to write stuff and not really sure where to start or what to write. So i'm flipping around different bits waiting for the inspiration to kick in\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sending productive vibes your way\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thank you. I remember this is what my brain does from work documents. I know once I get started it will be fine. Just got to line up the ducks\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: This message was deleted.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: <attached: 00012085-GIF-2024-03-04-16-22-23.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Katie texted and I ended up going for a quick dog walk with her, needed the fresh air. Did the inspiration come?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh nice. Did you enjoy?\\
Not really but I did get some stuff done.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Feels like I needed it, really not feeling well.\\
Good that you got some bits done. How much is left?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Normal unwell or catching something else unwell? Might sound wrong but couldn't think of a better way to ask.\\
Good to get out while it was nice.\\Erm, about 2200 words :face-with-tears-of-joy:. I have a plan of attach now. So that is something\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Like flare up getting really bad unwell.\\
That's a bit. But you can do it  now with a plan. When is it due?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well that sucks.\\
All due on Thursday. Hoping to get the first version finished tomorrow.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: This week's going to be hard\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have you had dinner yet?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh yeah I ate ages ago.\\
Tomorrow is going to be rough for you with parents evening.\\Seems to be 3 or 4 weeks into the term all start to stack up for  you.\\Need to rest more. When the washing machine will let you.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh what did you have?\\
Yes, that seems to be the pattern. It's not even the parents evening. I have to do two full days of speaking exams with y11 wed and thur.\\I will rest more after this week\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I had “leftover” chilli :grinning-face:\\
That seems like your party line “I’ll rest later” at least Saturday should actually be relaxing.\\Are they mock exams?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah. You're not going to let that one go :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Yeah I know. I just feel like I have to do things to feel at least half the person I used to be. But at the same time I know it's not the best way to go about things.\\Yes, these are their last ones before the big bad real ones next month\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Got to be a hard balance because you don’t only want to do work and sleep and hope you don’t feel like total crap for Saturday.\\
Hopefully a calmer job will help shift the balance\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It really is.\\
I really hope it will. I would love to feel better. and I would love for you to not always see me broken\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That would be nice. Only a few weeks to find out and 3 weeks until you get 2 weeks off\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm looking forward to being able to go for those walks when it stays light longer\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: image omitted\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, nice. Hope you sleep better.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Like your face\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I like all of you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night. Sleep well x x x x x x x x\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00012108-GIF-2024-03-05-06-12-18.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x\\
I'm feeling like I haven't slept :sleeping-face:\\How are you?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, that’s a bad sleep.\\
I’m ok. Bit tired and I now have to phone my bank after spin because I dared to try and move some money around :man-facepalming:\\What time is parents evening? Is it a half day for the kids again.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no, why do you have to phone them?\\
It's 2-6.30. we still have all the lessons, they are just shorter\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I tried to move money out of my savings account account to my chase account. So moving it out of bank. It tripped some alert and now I have to phone to make sure it’s me. Even though the accounts in both banks have the same name.\\
Probably a good thing really, just another thing to do.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hopefully it’s not too bad for you but a long day of talking :crying-face::smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aaah okay. It's good they are checking but faff.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm fully booked again :pensive-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Nice to be popular at least\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha. I don't think that's it :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope spin is good this morning. Have fun!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Lots of people in today’s class but soo much easier than yesterday’s.\\
To add to his quirks Jospeh doesn’t eat on the first Tuesday of the month. So he was once again off the bike.\\Hope today’s goes as well as it can for you.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you.\\
What's your plan for today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Work mainly. Looks like the weather has once again ruined a walk.\\
Got to shower and breakfast and then get cracking.\\No doubt some games later and I’m looking forward to a bit of a lie in tomorrow\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going home. Really not well\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Drive safe :red-heart:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Do you need anything?\\
Beyond a working body.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I just stopped at Aldi because I have no food and then straight to bed\\
Thank you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You setting an alarm or just sleeping?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll set an alarm just because I will have to be in tomorrow\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Is tomorrow the exams?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And Thursday :pensive-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: All you can do is rest and see what happens.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope you're having a better day :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: On your scale. Yes a much better day :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I set an alarm and then slept through it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That when you know you’re tired. When the phone doesn’t wake you.\\
Feel any better \/ different from the nap\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: None of my muscles are currently twitching :thumbs-up-light-skin-tone: but I have a headache :thumbs-down-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your day?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Progress :man-shrugging:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Days going ok. Making progress on the assignment but slower than expected while always being slow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Progress is good. You still have loads of time\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I have to try to get up to feed myself\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You can do it.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Debatable\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Get spud to make it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I wish\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sending you productive vibes for the rest of the assignment\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sending you feel better vibes\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I'm assuming you managed to hunt and find food\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I have. But haven't done much other\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's the assignment?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Given that eating is all you needed to do, that is a 100\% success.\\
Assignment is ok. Just need to write a bit more about the results and then an abstract and it’s done. If I didn’t have the tutorial I’d finish it today but got to switch to the other module.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good work today! Well done.\\
Give yourself a little brain time before your tutorial.\\When is it starting?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Starts at 7pm.\\
What are your plans for the evening?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I showered. So I guess that's it :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sounds like a good plan.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sorry I'm always moaning.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm just really struggling today\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: When were you moaning. You said you showered\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: During the day\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Still not sure it’s moaning. More statements of how your feeling\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah but it's nothing positive\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And I'm feeling a bit emotional\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What can I do?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't think you can do anything to be honest\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I want to be able to do things for you!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: In that case the only logic that works is to follow rule 1\\
Which is the reason for that rule anyway.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Remind me please, having a brain fart\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Take care of yourself\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah of course\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm trying\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: There you go then\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Easy ish sort of\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, sure\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I just want a cuddle\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :cat:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: He's being stand offish\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Has he stopped making noise.\\
Maybe that’s because he had plans for the day :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No still shouting at me\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Odd\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll have to wait for a cuddle till tomorrow then\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Didn't mean this to sound so demanding :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't have words today\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I would come round but not sure I can get to you cuddle and make it back in time for 7\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I didn't mean to ask for that. I know you're busy :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I would palm this one off but it’s an interactive one rather than be a talked at session\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't worry, honestly didn't mean it like that\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Obviously would love it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You might need to give me an extra squeeze when I see you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That I can do as long as I don’t break you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You can never break me\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hmmm, I have before\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just a little\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: See, breakable :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Meh, I'd rather have you and cuddles\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: as always, that tutorial hurt the brain\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And apart from that. How was it? What was it on?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: it was fine. The surprise quiz was an unwelcomed shock. It was on our current assignment where we analyse and write up an exoplanet transit that we setup to observe. actual science, which is nice. Hoping to get stuck into later this week and most of next week once this cosmology assignment is out of the way.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i'm guessing you've been pottering?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It sounds really interesting!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I just finished Lee's hat. Just the bobble to go\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh well done. Constructive\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just needed something to occupy my hands and mind\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What's your plan for the rest of the evening? Games?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good thing to do.\\
Just playing some games now.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How are the games going?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s a cool colour combo. Is it football themed? Well done.\\
Games are ok today. Nothing special but not super shit.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, he wanted a West Ham hat. Will start on the animals soon :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
Ah good that they are not super shit :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to head to bed now to hopefully get some more sleep.\\
Enjoy the games. Night night x x x x x x x x x\\Like you!\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: The animals should interesting.\\

Night x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\Hope you feel at least a bit more human in the morning.\\Like you!\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00012212-GIF-2024-03-06-07-52-27.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x\\
I'm feeling like I definitely shouldn't be here :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\How did you sleep? Did you manage a lay in?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s not a good start to the day. Is it just exams you have to do or other lessons as well.\\
Makes sense you’d need an extra day.\\Slept pretty well (just longer)\\Erm, currently still in bed. :grinning-face:About to hunt for breakfast\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You still coming over after work or would it be better for me to come to you?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just the exams today and tomorrow.\\
Very jealous of being in bed and just having breakfast.\\What are you up to today?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, I'd very much like to see you.\\
I'm not staying for training so will be leaving around 3.30 - alright if I go straight to you?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: The joys of no gym class and being economically inactive.\\
Need to go to post office, some shopping as I forgot to add basic stuff to my shopping this week like a moose :man-facepalming: and want to get my hair cut as it’s got a bit ridiculous. Then finish off my assignment.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That works. So about 4.\\
Are the exams more or less work than teaching normally?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ooh sexy sexy haircut\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Will you have enough time to finish assignment? We could do later\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Less physical but more mental because I need to carry out the exam, keep eye on timings and mark at the same time\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ve got time. Plus no games tonight so can work after you go if I need to.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good luck, you got this.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Every single kid has been late, two haven't turned up. I'm ready to go home :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your morning?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Of course they have. I’m guessing kid never have to worry about the time and it’s difficult to teach.\\
I’d start off by saying they have scored zero for being late but let’s see what you could have done.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Slow. I dilly dallied leaving the house so just finished hair cut. Now a quick shop, walk lunch work see you.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That would not work on them. They'd just take the zero :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Slow mornings are good.\\
Can't wait to see the haircut\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’d flip it then. Tell than after that it would have been X  but you were late so zero. :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: They are but not when there is stuff to do. Slow morning would be much better if it was deliberate, in bed and you were there.\\
Not the best haircut but it is at least shorter.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Should not of gone to Lidl’s before lunch :man-facepalming: £50 later just for yogurts.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What did you get?? :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: EVERYTHING :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Went slightly mad with some dinners. Steak and pasta options\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It sounds like it :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What kind of dinners did you get?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Steak and filled pasta. Not even complete meals. Just the main component.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How many more exams do you have?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And £50 worth of yoghurts :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just 2 more after lunch\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: £50 was the total for all of it.\\
Oh, so you’re nearly done. Well done.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aaah okay.\\
Another hour to go and then admin\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just about to leave.\\
Heads up, I do look like hell warmed over\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: ok, I expected you to say that :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Home and Spuddles fed\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you for being just amazing\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good to keep the beast tame.\\
Nice to see you. As always.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Will get some food into me and chill. Games for you? What's for dinner?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good plan.\\
No games today. Well Matt is just. I might try on my own or maybe some robot stuff but the brain is pretty done today.\\Lemon chicken tonight.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You deserve some chill time, you've worked loads today :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
Oh that sounds yum. Just nuking my leftovers :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Mark can do Monday but we wouldn’t get very long. Wednesday or Thursday next week would give us no deadline.\\
I assume you are late on Wednesday? So maybe Thursday is the better day?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aw thank you.\\
Yes Thursday would be better. I'm late on Wednesday and then bookclub\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Let’s do Thursday then.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Brill! Say thank you for me too please\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your evening? A little bit of chill?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, all chill. Not really moved since sitting down from dinner.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Watching watch making videos?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Nah, that was yesterday :face-with-tears-of-joy: new episode of “The Rookie”\\
Did watch some sailing stuff earlier\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I've been meaning to start that\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s fun if you don’t take it too serious\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm still binging Bones :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You’ve not finished it yet!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haven't had time\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh, thought there was 300 episodes or something\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 8 seasons I think\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: you all drugged up and in bed yet?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Drugged up but not in bed yet\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: are you pottering in that direction\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am, just finishing up the closing shift :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think I fixed the loo though\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: well done, just couldn't leave it then :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well... I was pottering anyway :woman-shrugging-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm in bed! Everything is taking me 3 hours longer\\

\section*{Thursday $07\textsuperscript{th}$}
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00012278-GIF-2024-03-07-05-59-41.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x\\
Oh no! Did you not set it ?\\Did you sleep okay?\\I'm not okay but I am up and just about not crying, so we'll take the little wins xx\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I thought I’d set it but I turned it off before it went off yesterday and resetting it yesterday didn’t seem to work. Or it was going to go off and the the front screen was lying. Will now have to test it.\\
:crying-face::red-heart: take the little wins. I’m guessing you didn’t get a lot of sleep.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You may have to prep work that you won’t be in tomorrow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I did the same thing yesterday and if I hadn't checked before bed last night I would have just slept through.\\
No I didn't. Or at least I don't feel like I did. And I was up couple times too plus the cat is obsessed with the wardrobe for some reason.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I have a feeling that might end up being the case :pensive-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Better to tell them today so that you have a chance of getting some extra sleep. Rather than wake up at 5:30 potter for an hour before phoning in sick.\\
Your only working today because of the exams\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I have a feeling my HOD will make the decision for me and tell me not to come\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Who are you spinning with today? Usual instructor?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep Joseph’s odd 30 min class. Better than nothing\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: This says you know you’re too sick to work. Hoping someone else point it out to you to reduce the guilt can only up the stress that they say something. Your body will not so kindly convert said stress into more pain.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know I know. I'll be good\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It definitely is!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So that means you’ll talk to your HOD.\\
Just to go on a bit. Your (this does apply to everyone) the only person who can advocate for what’s best for you. Other people will and do care (I care A LOT) but you have to be the biggest advocate for yourself.\\People will take all they can get especially when it benefits them.\\It easier for work if someone turns up rather than not coming to work. Work will take and take while you happily (wrong word) sacrifice your health and spare time. Work doesn’t  care about what employees do when they are not at work. Work just wants the work done.\\Rule \#1\\Taking care of yourself and staying healthy is not something to be or feel guilty about.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I will, I promise\\
I appreciate you caring a lot even though I know it's not easy\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok, good. I’ll hold you to that promise.\\
The hard bit is possibly not what you think is the hard bit. Being sick sucks but that’s not your fault. What is hard to see if watching someone you care about directly or indirectly do things that you know (hopefully they know as well) will hurt them more in both the short and long term. Certainly this week feels like a lot of micro self sabotage has gone on.\\Hope today goes well or as well as it can.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Feels like I'm being told off :see-no-evil-monkey:\\
Can you give me examples of the sabotages? I may not be seeing them\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not trying to tell you off. Just trying to make you put yourself first.\\
Some of these if not all will have the benefit of hindsight and I’m not trying to be mean. Just observations from the week.\\Saturday, you waited for me to reply to a txt I wasn’t expecting before you went for a nap. End result being you didn’t nap properly.\\Sunday, washing machine drain clogged. Annoying, you tidied it up but didn’t do anything to resolve the problem and didn’t do any small tests. Just a second full wash which then did exactly the same thing. This meant you had to baby sit the machine and clean up twice and move the machine twice, hurting yourself in the process. Hindsight being what it is. After it went wrong the first time a bit more less time consuming testing could have been done or just leave it and use my machine while you waited for drain cleaner etc. meant you lost the whole afternoon and stressing about water going downstairs.\\Later with painting nails. This took much longer than expected but you did start late. So you went to bed super late meaning a very bad start to the week. Which then compounds because you don’t get more sleep as the week progresses.\\Tuesday or Wednesday instagram betrays you as you were doom scrolling (I assume) well past bed time.\\Last night was another late bed time partly because (I imagine) you were trying to fix the toilet.\\Good to get it fixed but meant you had very low sleep.\\As the outsider looking in, there were just a couple of things where stubbornness seem to win over logic or waiting \/ asking for help.\\I do get it though. I hate things being broken or things not working. That’s why last week I was up to 1am trying to get code working. In what is a long list of unfair things, women seem to need more sleep than men and you need even more than most. I’m great at sabotaging an early night for no gain. Cally and Becky are masters at it and then complain endlessly about being tired. We just all have the benefit of that tiredness not converting into physical pain and if we do then sleep we only lost a day.\\Like with painting your nail. You wanted to do something nice for yourself and relaxing but the end result turned itself into a negative not a positive.\\Hope this come across the right way. I’m not trying to be mean or tell you off. I really really like you.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Flipping heck. That txt is longer than I expected\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :grimacing-face::grimacing-face::grimacing-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I feel like I need to defend myself :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
I didn't necessarily wait for you to answer my text on Saturday to be honest, it just worked out like that.\\I did test the washing machine after clearing up the first time and it worked fine hence me not expecting the second flooding.\\I wanted to do something nice for myself after a shit day.\\I don't think I was doom scrolling. I've been asleep before 10 every day this week\\You're imagining wrong. I spent whole two minutes looking at it, pulled some bits and hoped for the best.\\It's not stubbornness per se. I am desperately trying to live some kind of half way normal life\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: These are just explanations to some of the points.\\
It's different looking at everything from outside as if I don't tell you, you don't know what's the thinking behind stuff I do.\\And I know it's hard for normal\/healthy people to understand why I might do some extra bits. But when I've always had to do everything by myself and for myself, it just becomes a habit and sometimes I don't have the luxury of not doing something just because it might be hard at that time.\\I'd really like you to understand that I'm not being stubborn or flippant or not caring, but for too long I have been the only one I could rely on and only one to do stuff. The flat needs to be sorted, the cat needs to be fed, I need to get washed, etc etc. I have just been getting spoons on credit\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also this is not written in a fighty way, I hope it doesn't come across like that\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I did a bit.\\
I shouldn’t have answered the question as all I’ve achieved today is making you angry and defensive.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Noooooooo\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You didn't makee angry at all. I just felt I wanted to tell you my thinking behind this\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'd always want you to answer these questions because it helps me to see where I might not be realistic.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I probably shouldn't have answered in between exams because I obviously didn't put enough thought into how I would look like in writing\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I promise you, you didn't make me either of these things.\\
I honestly appreciate your view on things.\\Tone really doesn't carry well over text\\Please don't be upset\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Tone doesn't carry at all in text and it is easy to  for anyone to infer any tone you want. See that all the time on the YPOM FB group and dealt with it loads at work.\\
I'm not upset. Just annoyed at myself.\\At my desk now. Did my hour long round trip to the dentist for my usual 10 minute appointment :face-with-tears-of-joy: then did my walk\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Why are you annoyed at yourself?\\
I am annoyed at myself\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How are the teeths looking?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: this could get circular. Why are you annoyed?\\
I'm annoyed at myself as its not the first second third and surely wont be the last time I say stuff to someone (not just you). They dont like my response and then I end up feeling like I need to apologies for having idea's, thoughts or answering the question "wrong"\\Teeths are all clean now. Fortunately I have quite good teeth other than my naff wisdom teeth. Which was SOO much more painful than the vasectomy. Will be back in 6 month for the next cleaning.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Please don't be annoyed at yourself for this one.\\
I asked you the question and  wanted the answer. I didn't not like your answer, I just felt like I needed to tell you my rationale behind the things you mentioned.\\I don't want you to not answer if I ask a hard question only because you're worried I'll be upset\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok.\\
How are the exams going? Any better than yesterday?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Only better in that these ones are on time and prepared. I am exhausted\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is progress at least.\\
Only an hour left.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes yes.\\
How has your day been? Apart from stranger's hands in your mouth?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: the days has its usual slowness. Proper procrastination about submitting this assignment but just going to do it now. Feels like I am missing the point somewhere but I dont know what it could be and I am at the word limit anyway. Still think I'll get good marks but I might have stuff in the wrong sections. Will just have to see. This is the frustration with uni work. Anyway that could help can't help.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Missed voice call, Tap to call back\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: 2pm Sunday?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have you submitted?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Works great\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep, now on to detecting planets\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: you done now?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am! I spoke to my hod and staying home tomorrow\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: good plan\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope you are detecting all of them :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Wooo hoo!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll pretend it makes perfect sense to me. It's amazing how your brain works :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: the software does the work. Its all very hand wavy, push buttons and Yay, look at the dip in the line. Planet\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: you back home now\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You make it sound so easy\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't shout at me but I stopped to see Jenny. But it's on the way and I'm sitting down and won't be long. I've arranged it ages ago and not doing the evening later because it was rescheduled so just giving myself a little pep\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: after you've spent a few hours setting up the software its super easy :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: why would I shout at you. Your allowed to see your friends\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: seeing friends should also be relaxing\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Because I haven't gone straight home?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also shout is a strong word - look at me disapprovingly :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I'm very confused.\\
I had no idea you had something later today or I'd forgotten about it. I dont know why you'd think i'd have any sort of issue with you seeing a friend on the way back from work.\\The whole stuff from this morning was all centred around getting enough sleep. Not me wanting to stop you doing things. I dont want to stop you doing things or for you to not do thing you dont want to do.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh sweets. That is absolutely not how it was meant. I never even thought about you stopping me doing things or anything like that\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I hate texts honestly. Things get so lost in transit\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Voice call, 48 sec\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sorry I took you away from your dinner. Didn't realise :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Your fine. Was just in time really. Thank you for the donuts. It was unnecessary but appreciated\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I just saw them there and thought you'd like one as they didn't have any last time you went\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also my whole car smells like cheese :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh no. Hopefully that will fade.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was the steak?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Very good and the pepper sauce is acceptable as well\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah nice ! Good choice then.\\
What's your plan for the rest of the evening?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Games I think. See what the new update is like.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: With Matt?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, it’s to scary to play on my own. Which is a sad thing to say. I just get jump scared\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh bubs. I didn't realise it was a scary game.\\
I tried playing Last of Us once but couldn't get through one bit :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It isn’t a scary game :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: I just get scared\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, you'll have to show me\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I can show you.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Brill!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How are the games going?\\
I'm in bed already, after doing nothing\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Only played one game so far.\\
That is normally a good evening and you did go and see Jenny\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I did, you are right.\\
Hopefully I'll get some zzz\\Night night, sleep well.\\x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\Really like you\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Drugs?\\
Night x x x x x x x x x x x x\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes x x x x\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00012364-GIF-2024-03-08-06-47-56.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x\\
The body clock didn't, but I'll be napping.\\What time is your session with Hannah?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sessions at 7:30. Think it’s going to hurt today but we will see.\\
Are you feeling any less broken?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah if it doesn't hurt, it's not a good sesh I guess.\\
Definitely not less broken. Very good decision staying home, I'm barely mobile\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: True but there are degrees of broken from a session.\\
Well at least it was good to stay home. Do your best to ignore flat jobs and just relax \/ nap.\\Shame you don’t yet have your new sofa.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I hope it's a good session and doesn't hurt too much\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good session is the right phrase but OMG. Knackered.\\
Deadlift 3x6x170\\Apparently I’m allowed to blame Richard (Hannah’s boyfriend) for my loss of strength as he wanted the second kid :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\On my way home to sit. :face-exhaling:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that is a big deadlift. Well done.\\
I haven't gotten out of bed yet\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s a good morning to still be in bed. You do need food though.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Lloyd and Steph were impressed\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I do need food. I'm going to try and get up\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What's your plan?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You don’t have to get up up. You could roll.\\
Got a call with my friend Chris at 11, then will go for a walk, lunch then want to build up the new sensor board for my robot.\\Out in town with Lester later.\\Really not fancying park run tomorrow and that was before I remembered I was out with Lester.\\Are you going out later or going to call it last minute?\\You going to do a CBD bath.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I might have to do that.\\
You are having a lovely day :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: do you know where you're going with Lester?\\I've just texted the girls I won't be able to. I'm in burning pain and barely staying awake as is. I don't think I could cope with getting ready, let alone high energy, loud gig.\\I managed to get through to the GP but they are triaging everything so I'm waiting for a call if I can have an appointment\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just going into town. Probably Heidrun but not sure on food.\\
:smiling-face-with-hearts: I’m sorry your suffering so much. Sucks you have to miss going out.\\Just sleep if you need. I assume your phone will wake you up if the doctor ever phone back. Would you need to go or will it just be a silly not as useful phone call?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Heidrun is nice :slightly-smiling-face:\\
Yeah and you know how much I struggle when I have to miss out on things because of my stupid body. I'm feeling particularly sorry for myself.\\I have my phone on loud and have been dozing so it will wake me up. I'm really hoping I get a face to face. I have been keeping a track of my symptoms and have a list as long as my arm so really need to speak to someone in person\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know it’s a struggle. Especially at the moment as you’ve been trading doing work vs doing stuff for yourself.\\
I didn’t realise you’d been keeping a “sick” diary. Great idea. For me I think you last good day was 11th Feb.\\Push for the face to face and if you need a lift then let me know.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah, I have to because the amount of medical gaslighting I've experienced in the last 4 years is unreal. I am so tired of having to fight tooth and nail for any kind of understanding or treatment from them.\\
Thank you :smiling-face-with-hearts: it's only over the road so will be able to walk over. I'll let you know if anything happens\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: If it not obvious bleeding on the floor, a broken bone or cancer. Healthcare is a proper nightmare. It was so painful to get a simple blood test and the vasectomy booked in I’m almost afraid to imagine how annoying it is.\\
Plus all work now seems to be about just kicking the can down the road. Get the appointment or ticket off the screen and done.\\Hopefully moving forward you’ll at least have the time to harass people because you can take a call during the day or go to the doctor during work. Without any of it being an issue.\\Here if you need anything.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
I'm going to try do some food\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also, toilet lied to me and it's definitely not fixed\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s what mine did to me.\\
If the adjustment screw isn’t working or is broken we can just replace it. A new thingy is less than £20\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll have a look at it another day. Or maybe next time you come over?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep, need to have a look at least as there is a few options. Hopefully it’s easy to turn the water off to replace. All doable.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Could have a Quick Look Sunday\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you x x x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: This is probably what you need \url{https://www.toolstation.com/viva-skylo-dual-flush-syphon/p51299}\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: \url{https://youtu.be/x8iDRS0no1o?si=0ZEAVdRwryE90frj}\\
This is some of the stuff I watch. Just found this one. They look more normal than some of the channels I watch.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Next appointment available - 8 April\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What! That’s a joke. To see a doctor!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Or is that a specialist\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No, a review appt with the gp\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Is that something different than “I’m sick I need to see a doctor”  appointment?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Apparently\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Because it's a long term thing it's a review\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hmm, what if you say it’s an emergency for short term issues?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Obviously take the appointment on the 8th\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Could always suffer the pain of trying 111\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I booked that\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I might\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Worth a try.\\
You can see what people phone 999\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They are asking such stupid questions\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Someone is going to call me in the next two hours\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Receptionist gate keepers?\\
At least something might happen. Most of the battle is trying to actually talk to someone.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The 111 clinician gave me a 3.30 appointment at my own surgery\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :man-facepalming: you can’t even make that up but I believe it.\\
That’s the way to get one in the future.\\Good luck with it. Do you need any help?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly, so much stress for this.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll get myself together slowly, thank you.\\
How is your day going?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s going ok. Just about to start robot builder or at least robot faffing. Will see how far I get.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good luck with robot faffing.\\
Have you done your walk?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep, walk lunch shower all done. It’s still SO muddy and a bit cold but really nice to get out. The stream I really cool because of the high water. Some interesting fluid dynamics happening. :face-with-monocle:\\
Good luck with your appointment.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It looks so nice outside. Glad you managed to get out.\\
Thank you\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well I cried a whole load\\
She's given me some new meds but because they are so much stronger, also signed me off for a week with a review, because ideally she'd want me to stay off longer\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That's something at least. Are the meds just painkillers or something else? Do they need to be picked up\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: and does that mean you have a sooner review\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's a ssri\/used for neuro pain. They do need picking up\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: This ended up being the review but she booked me for another 5th April\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: when do the drugs need picking up?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Do they have a name?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They can be picked up anytime from Landsdale and they are under my name.\\
Would you be at all able to swing by there before you go out? I don't think I can make it today\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: that is why I was asking. So they can be picked up now?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Fluoxetine\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes they should be\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok, i'll head over and pick them up now\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Do these replace ones your taken?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Do you need anything from the shops?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No they are on top\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't think so, thank you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The pharmacy is the one across from Lidl\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Date of birth\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 23\/1\/87\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: NHS number\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't know\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hold on\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thx\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: They are making it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: My other meds might be ready too in case they mention it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I can check. What are you expecting?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nortriptyline and the pill\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll ask\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you requested them?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes but they might not be ready\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok, I’ll ask. Might just take a bit longer.\\
This place is crazy busy\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you so much\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's because my little pharmacy next door closed and they absorbed it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: They are just churning out drugs like I’ve never seen\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I appreciate this so much I can't imagine\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You can't imagine\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You don’t have to imagine because it’s happening\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Brain fuzz\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Brain fuzz might get worse before it gets better better on these new ones\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I'm just looking through the info\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not unexpected\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's why she signed me off\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Because of the lowered sex drive? Seems an odd reason\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahahah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The other side effects\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Apparently there's quite an adjustment period\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I guess you’ll find out.\\
At the moment all you know is that what’s happening now doesn’t work. So got to try something. Then adjust from there.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll give anything a try after this past month\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Then if something works it’s a case of reviewing to see if anything is redundant\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I guess that's for next month's appointment\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Then repeat each month. Would be my assumption\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Highly doubt that with the state of NHS\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Outside\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Buzz me Busby\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope you're having a nice evening :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
I'm just getting into bed.\\Night night x x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\I really really like you\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you have your bath. Take the new drugs?\\
Hope you sleep better and feel a bit more normal tomorrow\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I was worried about sleeping so I'll take them tomorrow. But taken all my other ones and a whole melatonin.\\
Thank you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\Enjoy your night\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good luck.\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x\\
I'm up and not crying - an improvement from yesterday I guess.\\How are you? Were you home late last night?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is an improvement then. Which is good. Do you know more details of the spa day yet?\\
I’m ok, not hungover. Which is nice. A fun evening. Mad squirrel actually has some nice beers again.\\Got home about 11:30. Bed before 1. So late but not super later\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, what did you do until 1?\\
Ah I'm glad you had a nice evening! How's Lester?\\Yes, Bev is getting here at 11.30 so will pick her up from the station and drive over to the spa. I think it's a 12-4 thing, but not sure if we're going to get food after. I'll keep you updated.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What's your plan?\\
Btw parkrun got cancelled again so you didn't miss out :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Pottered :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Get in, get drinks and snacks. Watch tv. Nearly fall asleep on sofa then go to bed.\\Lester is good. Tired as always as he proper self sabotages going to sleep. Window cleaners scratched his car so more faff for him to get fixed. He really doesn’t have a lot of luck with trades people.\\I saw it got cancelled. Phew. Guilt for not going removed.\\Hope you enjoy today. Don’t rush just to come and see me. I think you’re going to be later than you think plus the new drugs might do something.\\If we do see each other then that’s obviously great but don’t not see your friend (if that makes sense)\\Plan for today. Get out of bed at some point. Breakfast. Robot, walk lunch robot F1.\\It might be better to go into town today to get some scones, cream and jam than tomorrow morning but not sure.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah, pottering ! I'm rubbing off on you.\\
I won't rush. But I'd still like to see you even for a little bit. I'll see what the day brings.\\Yeah might be easier today, I'm guessing tomorrow might be a bit busier. Where are you going to go?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I wish :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
Well I’m not going anywhere this afternoon so you’ll know where I’ll be. At this point food could just be snacks, mc Donald’s or hello boss.\\No idea where to go was thinking M\&S to start. I should go today really.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: M\&s is a good place for scones.\\
Enjoy your easy morning :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Heya. How's your day been?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hello, it’s been ok. I went into town and remember why I dislike people. I don’t what people are thinking about out it certainly isn’t what they are doing.\\
Quite a bit of procrastinating but did a walk.\\Now watching the F1.\\How was the spa? Are you fully relaxed? <This message was edited>\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah yes, people in larger quantities are stupid. Well done on the walk.\\
Spa was super nice. We're just in Works grabbing a dessert after our late lunch\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: The stupidity was everywhere today. Was a good confirmation on my vasectomy. The whole time there was a kid crying or throwing a tantrum or dropping something.\\
Oh nice. Cheesecake?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've cream sundae :drooling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Enjoy, any side effects from the new drug?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Banana ruins it :squinting-face-with-tongue:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Stop it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Do you want me to bring you something\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thank you but I’m ok. I got some hazelnut pastry thing from M\&S to try.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm just dropping bev off. Shall I pop round for a little bit?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: If your up for it the yeah. As long as you don’t judge the house or that I forgot to shave.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I can do a quick cup of tea? Have you finished F1 yet?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah it’s finished\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just leaving the station so see you in a bit\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: image omitted\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh dear. Was he sat on the counter with an overlord look.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Waiting for me in the window\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've checked with the friend who takes the meds and she also said she's taking them in the morning because it messes her sleep so will take them first thing tomorrow\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good idea. You certainly don’t need a 3rd time to take drugs.\\
Just have to see what they do. Won’t know until you try.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know you're right. I just get really worried about new meds\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's the dial video?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I can imagine, but the last few weeks have been real bad for you. No doubt a mix of drugs and stress. Nothing changes if nothing changes.\\
These new drugs should do something. Give them a few days \/ week and see what it’s like. You can always stop taking them or go back to try something else.\\The daily video is good. The production value from just one guy is amazing\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They have been quite horrendous.\\
Hopefully I won't get some weird ass rare side effect while we're at your mum's :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\It looked very well made from the little bit you showed me.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I took a melatonin and am already in bed.\\
Early night for you?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: We can deal with any side effects as and when they happen.\\
Will be an early night for me. See if I can get a little bit of an early start tomorrow.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
What are you up to in the morning?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Wild ideas of progressing the robot. We will see.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oooh yes. You can do it!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The melatonin is starting to hit so I'll say night night. Sleep well x x x x x x x x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night x x x x x x x x x x\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00012524-GIF-2024-03-10-07-27-36.mp4>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m not sure why but I had a thought this morning.  Could the run be responsible in anyway for current flair?\\
I think I was wrong with the 11th being you last good day. You ran with the group on the 20th and we did the winter run on the 25th and you definitely haven’t really had a day off or much relaxing since the run.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: And you hit the gym last Sunday\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x\\
You're up early!\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m always up early :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:. Was asleep before 11 and the body said that was enough.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh it's definitely in there for reasons for the flare. I think it's more that I didn't have a proper rest after and just went straight into work madness, very little rest even over the last few weekends. It all just compounds, death by thousand cuts I guess\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah usually you're more of an 8am wake up, no?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Certainly seems to be very compounding. The new drugs will hopefully help but it also means that once your settled in the new job you’ll also have more  time to relax.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Normally yes for none gym days. Just woke up early today and went with it. Currently I’m awake and not crying but not up :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully :crossed-fingers:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, awake and not crying is good!\\
Same here but not both of us are awake\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Aww, poor tired little freeloader. He had such a busy day of sleeping yesterday as well.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know! But sod's law, the one day he doesn't faff around I wake up early by myself\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Would have put money on that. I assume you’re worried about drugs and seeing my mum. Which will have woke you up\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Actually I just needed the loo :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Checking in to see how you’re doing?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've had breakfast and taken meds an went to bed. Just woke up :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sounds like a good morning so far. Any immediate side effects or good effects?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not sure to be honest. I'm feeling a bit dizzy but that's probably from the nap\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not immediately worse is a good start.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup, I guess\\
How's robot building?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Full procrastination. Not sure the best place to be starting so I’m just not starting :man-facepalming:\\
Also trying to reverse engineering this.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Do that I can use some of it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So that\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh noo! You'll have loads of work to do during the week. But maybe the time crunch will help\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Annoyingly yes the time crunch does help. Just not the right way.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How not the right way?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Waiting for the time pressure before being able to start a task is just asking for trouble.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yes, I get what you meant now\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: On my way.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Home and in joggers. Nice seeing you today (as always).\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: My Mum really enjoyed us both being there as well\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nice! Enjoy a chilled evening. What are you going to do?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aww I really enjoyed it too. Tell her again thank you for having me\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And loved spending time with you, even though I'm bit of a poor company at the moment\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have no idea. Might try and work out what software approach to use or just might chill\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: so that you can sleep better tonight. I have ordered my food for next Saturday :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahahaha. What did you order?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: some brisket burger. It looks a bit like blue grass BBQ\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Chilling might be nice and approaching it with fresh mind might help. Or you never know, a bolt of inspiration might hit you out of nowhere\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nice!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: and I have updated my hotel. Only £58 more for the extra night.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that's really good!\\
You're so productive!!\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I knew it wouldn't take very long when I actually sat to do it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't worry, I know the pits of procrastination station so very well\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was your evening?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Was ok. I figured out a bunch of stuff. Have a way forward now.\\
Probably heading off to bed soon.\\Did you watch strange things?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh well done! That's a good progress!\\
I'm just pottering my way to bed.\\No, ended up watching bones :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Safe choice, less brain power needed.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Faaaaar less. And started on the gloves :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh wow. Productive as well.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Jittery\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you woke up then or just jittery?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Felt like I had a lot of nervous energy and had to physically tell myself to get ready for bed because I could have stayed on the couch. Might take a melatonin\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Might as well. Hope you get to sleep ok.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Me too. I feel a bit wired\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think “weird” will stick around for a few days\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah me too!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Right, in bed. Let's see what happens.\\
Night night x x x x x x x x x x x x\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: <attached: 00012586-GIF-2024-03-10-21-54-34.mp4>\\

\section*{Monday $11\textsuperscript{th}$}
Like you loads. :red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00012588-GIF-2024-03-11-06-19-17.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x\\
I've slept alright, just woke up at 4 fully awake but managed to go back to sleep after a while.\\How was spin?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00012590-GIF-2024-03-11-08-20-02.mp4>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s good about your sleep. A pain to wake up but if you got back to sleep then that’s good.\\
They recon people used to get up for a couple of hours during the night and it’s only the last 100 years that we have stopped\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: How are you feeling pain and weird wise\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Compared to other days\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha. A tough class?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The class is brutal.  Not quite as bad as last week but that might be because I pushed it a bit too hard too soon.\\
If I could do one of her classes 3 times a week, park run and lifting weights I’d be sorted.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good energy and music in the class\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Don’t avoid the questions :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm not, just trying to eat breakfast at the same time :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, will let you off\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm in pain. Not as much weirdness as yesterday afternoon\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh does she do any other classes you could go to?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How’s the pain compare to last week? More less same different.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think she teaches somewhere else as well but only does the one class at buzz. I don’t think I can be a memeber of 3 gyms\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Different, but a little worse\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah yeah, that might be a little excessive :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What's the plan for today?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well that sucks. See what today brings I guess :man-shrugging:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Shower, shopping arrives soon.\\
Hannah at 10:30.\\Talking with Chris at 3pm\\Dinner with Becky.\\Fit in robot stuff around all of that.\\Going to blink and the day will be gone.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Other than pottering and sitting what are your plans?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Busy day for you!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to be good and do nothing. Will have a nap. Might try the washing machine later\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm about to take the meds so will see whether weirdness comes back\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Do the chemicals first in the sink but if you’ve run the tap leave it 10 minutes first then dump the chemicals. Leave them twice as long as it says and pour it quite slow.\\
I’m sure it’s designed to just instantly wash away so you buy more.\\Then run a rinse on the washing machine to see if that goes ok.\\Good luck with the meds. Are you adding the weirdness to you pain dairy?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That just based on me using the chemicals last week. Not any sort of assumption that you didn’t know how to do it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know lovely :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll do that but maybe in the afternoon\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll be adding it to the symptoms list but considering they didn't even want to look at it last time I'm not sure how much it will help\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It might just help you. Better to record and not need than need it late. Especially at the moment with new drugs. Can take what difference they produce.\\
I think just the next few days if you doing nothing will be good.\\Just the lack of stress (maybe wrong word) from you knowing you weren’t going to school today meant you seemed a lot brighter yesterday. Mentally.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, I know what you mean\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope your session with Hannah is good :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Me too. Its arms so should be good. Just as well as legs are dead\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: I'm sure she'll disable your arms too\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh yeah, I’ll be fully broken by lunch.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: <attached: 00012625-GIF-2024-03-11-10-25-22.mp4>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00012626-GIF-2024-03-11-12-15-06.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well done!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm back in bed\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good plan. Because you wanted a nap or the weirdness has taken over\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Little bit of both I think\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is the point of this week. Rest! Let the drugs settle and see.\\
Bear hug the cat :grinning-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I did think I could drop in on my way to Becky’s if you like. Just for a little bit. I have a present for you.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :smiling-face-with-hearts: what time are you thinking of coming?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Don’t really know. I’m going to Becky’s for 7:30 and she is 15 mins away from you. So up to you really. Could do 6 or 6:30\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 6 is good :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok, don’t want to be interrupting your rest\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You won't be :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: look forward to seeing you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just getting ready to leave\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki\\
Just finishing dinner\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: No spaces I’ll have to try John Lewis on my way back\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no. I'm sorry\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was your evening?\\
I'm just going to bed. Night night x x x x x x x x x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just got home. Managed to post your parcel at Morrisons I the end. The John Lewis one is NOT 24\/7 despite what the site says :man-facepalming:\\
Evening was nice.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you xxxxxx\\
\section*{Tuesday $12\textsuperscript{th}$}
Tell me about it tomorrow?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00012647-GIF-2024-03-12-06-24-42.mp4>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Last night was good. Bit later than I expected. Becky was slightly disorganised which is pretty normal. She is always trying to do too much. Not helped by Poppy rolling in something disgusting. So worse that shit.\\
The kids were there usual selves winding her up a bit. Arguments over where they sit in the car etc. then some stuff she can’t do much about where her daughter doesn’t want to stay at dad’s house. That’s all a bit rough as she can’t do anything about that unless her daughter tells other people.\\All very bad for the children when parents separate and they don’t get on. By all account her ex husband is a narcissist.\\She’s struggling to not feel jealous about her sisters new boyfriend. She has a twin sister and she has just started dating a millionaire who is super nice. Buying her things and going to really nice restaurants etc and he met the parents. The sister (Jenny) hasn’t told Becky any of it and has started to withdraw a little. So not only does Becky feel a bit left out there is some jealousy as well. Which she even says is irrational.\\Although her dating of Kev seems to be going well. Standard Becky of going quite fast. I think they are on week 3 or 4. He is coming over on Wednesday and then she is going to stay with him on Saturday. He seems very nice and understanding.\\Was a nice evening.\\Let’s see what todays weird spin class is like :man-facepalming:\\How are you feeling? Same, different, worse.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x\\
How was spin?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oof Becky has a lot on her plate. How old are her kids?\\
It's hard juggling all of the things by herself. I really hope things start getting easier for her\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Spin was an odd combination or not very well thought out, easy and hard all at the same time. Jospeh was complaining about his own training session from yesterday. He is training for an iron man. :face-with-rolling-eyes:\\
Becky’s kids are 12 and 8 (boy and girl). Sadly I don’t think things (kids wise) will get any easier until the kids are a lot older at least another 4-5 years.\\Her whole situation and Toria’s brother in law’s situation is all enough on it own to make you question have kids. Let alone having to look after them.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: How you feeling this morning?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh Joseph seems to be slacking. Was the session at least decent?\\
Those are hard ages, and it will only get harder before it gets easier.\\What's going on with Toria's BIL?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Weird. It's the only way I can describe it.\\
I think I've slept through the night though.\\I'm still in pain, fuzzy and nauseous\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: The session was good in terms of getting it done but they are just not very good  compared to any of the other instructors.\\
Toria BIL is a whole thing. The end result of 2+ years of court cases and him having to defend himself from a false abuse claim means he is finally the has full custody of both his boys 5\&8.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s got to be something if you at least think you slept through.\\
Is the pain same better worse different?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Only 2 tablets so far I guess so cannot expect too much.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: When I finally woke up this morning I saw the light coming through and though “oh, might be nice for a walk and or run today”\\
NOPE, it’s fucking horrid still.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that is terrible. I do feel for parents having to fight. And sole custody is so hard\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's both weirdly localised at times and then just all over.\\
It's the nausea that I'm struggling with. Really don't know what to eat to get some food into me without feeling crap\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It looks horrendous.\\
What's your plan for today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Porridge for food? Might bounce but it is boring food.\\
If the nausea is like a hangover one maybe a little bit of food will help get rid of it?\\Plan for today is just all robot and see how far I get.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's not the same as a hangover one. When I eat, it gets worse, like last night\\
Sounds like a good plan. Hope you make good progress :smiling-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Could you try little and often with the food?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I will try :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Amazing. Well done. You’ve been busy.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've been binging Bones :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I might have a nap now\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good plan. Did you manage to eat anything?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: A little toast\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: image omitted\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: good idea\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's roboting going?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not too bad. Still soldering everything but it’s getting there.\\
Good nap?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yay! Progress! I wish I was more help with anything\\
It was a nap. Feeling super weird still. Will try some food\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It would be a tricky to have 2 people solder at the same time but it would be a help if you could design PCB’s.\\
Assuming this ones works that will be the next step. Designing my own board.\\More weird than before?\\Can you get more weird :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah unfortunately I can do none of those things :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Well apparently I can. I don't think it's more weird necessarily. Maybe a little. I'm just not used to feeling this crap for prolonged periods of time and not being able to do anything about it.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: As in not being able to do anything about the weird feelings? In theory the new drug induced weirdness should start to fade a bit after today \/ tomorrow. Which should reduce the previous weirdness\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah. I'm definitely hoping so.\\
I'm going to try to get myself outside for a bit tomorrow if it ever stops raining\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Getting outside is a good idea. I know that I start to go a bit odd if I have more than 2 days inside. Would be good if it is even partially nicer.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I just need it not to rain :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
I might or might not be going a bit loopy from being stuck here\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I bet it’s frustrating. Just a couple of days more to see where it all ends up.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know, I know :smiling-face:\\
Still soldering?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep, soldering away. Always takes longer than I think.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh amazing! Well done :smiling-face:\\
You are so very handy\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I try :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh wow. A proper full day's work. What needs to be done next?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Dinner is next :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Then need a cable to connect sensor board to main board and then it’s a bunch of testing to see if any of it works.\\Hopefully the bolts I ordered arrive tomorrow.\\Have you been up to anything? Another nap?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, what are you having?\\
So almost done after the testing?\\I've done nothing :pensive-face: starting to feel useless :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I was thinking we haven't arranged anything for this week and you're going away on Friday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Cooking some pasta chicken bake concoction and had a total brain failure on food.\\
In theory almost done after testing. Just depends on how well testing goes :man-facepalming:. Will just be nice if I’ve got half a chance of it working.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Your meant to be doing nothing so that well done for the day.\\
As for this week originally I’d thought we were having dinner after the car on Thursday but those things are probably disconnected now.\\I have steaks for us but at the moment I don’t know what sort of eating you’ll like.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That sounds like a good dinner.\\
Hopefully it will all work well.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah yeah, did your brother say when we could pop up?\\
Shall we still do dinner in Thursday? I might be less nauseous and\/or I might be able to have little steak\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'd like to see you before you go\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah we can still go for dinner Thursday.\\
Need to get a time from my brother. You don’t need to go. I can just pick your car up. Will be a good hour if not 2 and his workshop is cold.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki, let me know what he says.\\
But you can't mess up my now perfectly set up seat :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Unless you seat is mega wonky all I will do is move it backwards\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: 2pm tomorrow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. I'll do a food shop in the morning\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: <attached: 00012705-VIDEO-2024-03-12-18-09-21.mp4>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, I think that’s the most I’ve seen him attack a toy\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's a chewing silvervine stick. He's quite into it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did you end up going for the run?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No, not in this weather. Just didn’t want to run in this misery.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your evening been?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Been ok. Dinner took quite a while to cook and now just playing some games\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Was it nice?\\
How are the games? Are you playing with Matt?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was ok. It was just a pasta bake jar thing that I added chicken to. Just that it takes an hour :man-facepalming:\\
Games are a bit rough today. Everyone else seems very good. Yeah with Matt. We are not on form :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah.\\
I really need to play with you at some point to see what this is all about\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s all about frustration and pain. You need some new gaming equipment.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well hope it isn't too horrendous :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: In bed and drugged up.\\
Night night x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: <attached: 00012718-GIF-2024-03-12-21-51-08.mp4>\\

\section*{Wednesday $13\textsuperscript{th}$}
Hope you sleep well again.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00012720-GIF-2024-03-13-08-06-28.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x\\
Just woken up. I slept all the way till 5 I think but managed to go back to sleep after a little while.\\How are you?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s good. Does the watch say you’ve been getting sleep. You might be up at 5 because your used to it?\\
I’m ok. Haven’t made it out of bed yet.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Watch died in the middle of the night so don't really know :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
That's good. Enjoy your lay in. What are you up to today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Going to get breakfast. Then robot, which will hopefully do something today.\\
Then hopefully getting some of the stuff fixed in your car which hasn’t side benefit of meaning I’ll see you for a little bit.\\Are you venturing outside today?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully the testing works on the robot.\\
What time will you be coming for the car?\\Bare minimum I'm going to do a food shop this morning and see how I feel after that\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll come over just after 1:30. Only 10 minutes to my brothers workshop. Probably be back about 4 I’d guess. Got to at least get off of Cressex by then otherwise it’s a nightmare.\\
Hopefully shopping is quite\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki.\\
Hope roboting goes well\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well shopping completely wiped me out :upside-down-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: More than expected?\\
Well done for getting out though\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah much more\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's roboting?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Going ok, just takes ages making up cables. Would all be so much faster if I could make a PCB but that would also mean I’d have to have a design that could work.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Nap time?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I really want to understand what this means :exploding-head:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Most probably. Would love to be a half way decent human again\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Only day 3\/4 of the drugs? Are they having any positive effect? Seems like your sleeping a bit better but that could easily just be because your not worrying about getting your to go to work.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Assuming I don’t make a mistake in designing the PCB\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That looks like a lot of very detailed work!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You're quite amazing you know that\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah, it's too early for any positive effects I think. Just my body getting used to them\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It is quite a lot of detail. I do think anyone could do it though.\\
Possibly one of my problems but thank you.\\One more cable to make up and then I can switch to software and see if anything is taking properly.\\Have you had any thought about trying to talk to the doctor again this \/ what to do about work next week or is all of that too soon?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Being amazing is one of your problems?\\
Woo hoo, hope it all works\\I've thought about it but I think I'll make a decision in Friday. Ideally, I'd go back next week but I need to feel better. I can't teach while barely standing and not being able to eat\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll try more movement tomorrow and Friday and see what happens\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, no. One of my problems is thinking that if I can do something then everyone can do it because it cannot be that hard if I can do it.\\
I guess give it till Friday lunch and see how you are. Given that going to the shops nearly killed you it wouldn’t be a good idea to try and teach.\\Are feeling any better compared to last week or just all weirdly different?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: 2 of my open uni groups are have full on cry :loudly-crying-face: fests at the moment. Students :man-facepalming:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh stop it! Give yourself more credit please. You can do so many things that I can't (and vice versa)\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's all just weirdly different. But I am in less pain than last week. Not no pain, but definitely less\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no, why are they cry fests?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I can't nap :upside-down-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That good at least. At your normal baseline pain level or still higher?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not if you’re on your phone :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: but that is a pain.\\
I’m just having lunch then will come get the car. My brother is ready earlier.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Can tell you later\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Still higher than baseline\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I wasn't, I really tried\\
Oki, let me know when you're on the way\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: On my way\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yay\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh wooooow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Is it a reasonably easy fix?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Should be. New wires and should be good.\\
Am finding out options for the flashing mileage. My brother has seen it before.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I appreciate you so much\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's it going?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Pretty much done. Just fixing rear window dentist\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Demist\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh wow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to jump in the shower if I have time?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just leaving now\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah okay. Won't jump in the shower :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00012773-GIF-2024-03-13-18-25-38.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I really like you too\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your evening been?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: 2 steps forward and 1 step back. Making progress but got a short circuit somewhere I dont yet understand.\\
How was book club\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh noo. Will you be able to figure it out?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Bookclub still ongoing\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I hope so. Dont understand why it is happening. Might have to sleep on it which I really dont want to do.\\
That a long chat about a book\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Fresh mind might help <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh it's a chat about life and the book\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: In bed now!\\
Hope you're not working still. Rest will help\\Night night x x x x x x x x x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just going to bed now. Not really how I wanted the evening to end and not the problem I was expecting.\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x\\
I was up again at 5 but fell back asleep and just woke up.\\How was spin and gym?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You must be so used to 5am that the body just wakes up.\\
Spin was proper shit today. He wasn’t on the bike again. Way too much rest time and very little thought into the class. You only really notice once a better class exists.\\Gym was super busy but went well. Just did a very little bench session, working on range of motion and remembering technique.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I think that's it. At least I was able to go back to sleep\\
Boo that sounds like a crap class. Shame the Monday woman doesn't do more in buzz.\\But well done on doing the gym as well\\More roboting today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep, got to try and get the thing working. I have a plan. Just need to shower and breakfast first. Then see what happens.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have everything crossed for you. You can do it!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: <attached: 00012791-GIF-2024-03-14-08-56-44.mp4>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thanks :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Think I figured something out while shaving\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Woooo\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What did you figure out?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I can feed battery voltage straight into the board because it has its own regulator. Unlike the other board I was using that was very sensitive.\\
I think it’s my voltage regulator that is causing me the problem. Will find out soon enough\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope it works!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Me too.\\
You still coming for dinner later? Any thoughts on what time?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'd like to.\\
You tell me time - I don't want to mess up your prep for tomorrow and robot building\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Shall we say 5?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Brill! Do I need to bring anything?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That depends.\\
What I have is steak, chips and pepper sauce. Think I have some peas.\\Or I could see if steak will last to next week and do pasta.\\Assuming you going to want any food.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'd like some steak :pleading-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok. It is the day for it.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully I'll be able to eat it! Or you'll have double dinner :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Disaster :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I just realised what date it is :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Still good for 5?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm trying my best :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have you finished with what you need done?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not even close but progress has been made\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: As always need an extra day but might be ok\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Do you want me to come later?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No, I think earlier is better. I’m assuming you weren’t staying super late.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Till at least 1 am\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think I’ll try putting my presentation together after you go,\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sleeping on my sofa then :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll get dressed and feed the cat and come over.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: When I say dressed I mean comfy\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I assumed you’d be dressed comfy.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You ok to drive?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I'll be okay\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Drugs\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll bring them with\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Leaving now\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Don’t forget to charge your toothbrush\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Finally home :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did you get the internet to work?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Nope, still broken.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh booo. Wonder what it is\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Can you leave it and work on stuff for tomorrow?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I can. Was hoping to do the presentation but need the internet for a lot of it.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Can you tether?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not easily because it’s not a laptop\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aaah of course\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What are you going to do?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Do you want to borrow mine?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I can keep working on the robot for now.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah at least that\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: In bed and drugged up.\\
How did it go with the robot?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done. I’ll be going soon. Internet still broken. Very infuriating.\\
Robot is going ok. Going to give it 10 more minutes and see if I can make it move in the maze.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good plan. Hopefully the internet sorts itself out over night.\\
You can work here or borrow my laptop if needed though\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hopefully, I’d feel better about it if there status page indicated a problem. Will just have to see.\\
Thanks. At the moment I’m thinking I might just have to apologies and postpone my presentation.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well fingers crossed it works in the morning\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night x x x x x x x x x x x\\
I really bloody like you\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night x x x x x x x\\

I *really* like you as well.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00012850-GIF-2024-03-15-07-02-01.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x\\
I slept but also woke up at 4 and couldn't go back to sleep :sleeping-face:\\Just going for a walk with Katie and Baxter.\\That's so annoying with the internet. Wonder what has happened.\\Hope you have a good sesh with Hannah :smiling-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Earlier walk than I was expecting. Enjoy.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's a before work walk and I haven't seen her in couple weeks. How's gym been?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00012854-GIF-2024-03-15-09-05-02.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you sorting the last bits and pieces this morning?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s the plan and trying to get internet back. As I will need it for uni next week\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How was the walk?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How did the fixing go?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It was nice. Will be going for another one with Becky in a bit. But had to have a nap right after\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It didn’t. Was on hold for 20 minutes before they forced me to leave a message. Think the best plan is to shower. Throw together some sort of presentation. Get the laptop working and fired up then just go to the hotel\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That why I got confused with your early walk :man-facepalming:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ve had to turn my hot water on from the device. Like some cave dweller\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no! Horrendous\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aaah yea. Katie was a last minute decision after I got home last night\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh bugger. That's bad customer service. Who are you with?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s like a nightmare. Got to turn on light switches from the wall. No radio in the kitchen. Nothing to watch. Would be better if the gas wasn’t working, just.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hey broadband. They’ve been good. Just not today. Never had an outage this long\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How do you feel after your nap\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Tbh, a lot of your stuff does run on internet so it's definitely not ideal\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Really hope they sort it for you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Tbh, not great. Still super nauseous. And one super slow short walk should not wipe me out like this\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: When are you leaving?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :crying-face: got to be the new drugs? Are you definitely off work next week?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not sure yet. At least a couple of hours. Probably after lunch. Then I can do some work in the hotel room.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It must be. I haven't felt this bad before. But I'm not in loads of pain\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not sure yet. They said my extension request is with the doctor. I will make a final decision on Sunday I guess\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s something at least. So the pain has been switched for fatigue. But then you didn’t sleep great last night. Maybe afternoon nap will help.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll text you after Becky and maybe I'll be in time for a goodbye snog?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Is it not nicer to tell the school today for at least Monday cover\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What time you seeing Becky?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I could swing by your on my way.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah, I didn't. But I have been feeling quite jittery on an evening so has been harder to settle\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 11.30 so probably home by like 1ish <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I honestly don't know. I'd like to go in if I'm well enough\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The question to ask is could you have gone to school today and given the progression of the week do you think 2 more days will be significant enough for Monday.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok, don’t think I’ll be leaving by then.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Before then even\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I could have gone but I wouldn't be able to function.\\
And I don't know. A week might be the magic boundary and I'll feel perfect on Sunday\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: So I shall stop by?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: If that’s easier or I can come to you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It might be. I k ow schools work different but my hang over from consulting is it’s always best to disappoint early and while people can do something with the information.\\
I’d be inclined to tell you HOD\\“The new drugs the doctor has given have wiped me out and I’ve not been able to function this week. Next to say I won’t be in Monday and will update you Monday.” <This message was edited>\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll stop by on the way\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah her I will tell. I was more thinking the cover superior. I'll probably speak to her this afternoon\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What time will that be?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: After 1?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll keep you updated\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But if you want to leave earlier just let me know\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok.\\
Got a response from the broadband company. Tis knackered. They need to send an engineer :man-facepalming:.\\I saw someone yesterday doing something. Knew it would mess something up.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh bugger. When is the engineer coming? And specifically to your house or general area?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Tuesday :man-facepalming: and they didn’t say about anyone else.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh crap. Can I help in any way?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No it’s ok. I’ll make something work. Biggest pain in getting office on my laptop but doing that now.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Voice call, 29 sec\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: When are you heading off?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Already did. Just stopped at services on the M11.\\
Slow going. Did the doctor phone back?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I was wondering :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yea, I've got another appointment on the 5th\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh right. That was the original one? What about the sign off extension or is that different?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No it's another one for that day with a different doc.\\
Got the extension too\\How's the traffic?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Traffic is shit. Got just over an hour left. Hopefully\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well I hope you have a safe journey. Let me know when you're there\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Extension is good. Did they say anything about the drug effects calming down?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Will do\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh they just sent it through without talking to me\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But I've been told 2-4 weeks for nausea to go\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That rough. Did eating help?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Only in the way that I wasn't feeling dizzy and lightheaded anymore. Still made me feel yukky\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just parked up. That took forever :man-facepalming:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How long did it take you?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Glad you arrived safe\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think nearly 4 hours\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That is long\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hows the hotel?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: As I expected and I do not miss them. Room is super hot.\\
But it’s ok. Just going to have a look at my presentation for a few minutes then try and hunt for food and maybe a beer.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you manage an extra nap?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I was in bed but didn't sleep\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope it airs out. Hotel rooms are hot even for me.\\
Hope the finishing touches go well\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Like your face\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh really :winking-face::winking-face:\\
:face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Like your face :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Let me reword it .... I couldn't sleep :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is what I knew you meant\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha, I know\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Managed to find a surprise bar a bit like Heidrun.\\
Might still grab food from Tesco. Not sure yet.\\Full hotel nostalgia\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh nice!\\
Are any of your friends there already?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ve not seen anyone. Friends might be a stretch.  I did think I’d have seen some of them though. Tomorrow night it we will all meet up.\\
It is nice \/ funny just people watching and listening.\\Also nice being by the marina. Shame it’s dark. I always like being near boats. Not sure why.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you getting dinner out?\\
I do love having a dinner\/coffee alone and just people watching\\I love being by the water\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think dinner is going to be Tesco. I could eat here but will be the same as tomorrow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: At least you have a chilled evening. Presentation all finished?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think so. Will just wing it.\\
Like all my presentations\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hopefully it adds some value. Sort of a strange topic to give to a room of people more experienced than I am.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Strong confident statement :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What topic is it on? Your robot?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: A beginner perspective\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: A little talk about the non obvious stuff I had to learn and mistakes I’ve made.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That sounds interesting\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hopefully.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: My hope is that it helps them help new people in the future.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Will check it again in the morning.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You'll do great\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Think I’ve got to get up at 6:30 tomorrow.\\
At least mine is first. So it’s done\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh early one.\\
So is it like presentations all day or like demonstrations?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Presentations all day. Maybe there is a demo but the idea is all talks \/ theory\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well I'm sure it's going to be a good day for you :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I hope so. We will see.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm pottering my way to bed\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, I thought so.\\
Crazy Friday night. :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You haven't seen crazy yet :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: sometimes I even do hot milk with honey\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Calm down :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well you're away :woman-shrugging-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh right, because if I was around it would be a 1am banger. Rather than a 10pm bedtime\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah, yes\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've been outside TWICE today\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is true. That’s 2 things plus you saw me\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: For a very tiny bit of time\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: But that did make 3 things\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes it did\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And I hoovered\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh and two loads of laundry - I was watching it like a hawk :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And pottered and 2 naps\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Assume that worked ok though\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 1 nap\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Maybe 7 things\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes it did\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: 1 nap and 1 bed time :winking-face::winking-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's loads of things\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: *LOADS*\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Proud of me?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yes, as long as you haven’t pushed too far\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I haven't\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And I've taken all my drugs and a melatonin\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Proper adulting\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Evenings I definitely have more energy these last few days\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: As I tell everyone. You just need to remove work and everything starts to get better\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Of course.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It does seem that way. You certainly seemed “better” on Thursday. More jokey etc\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just to sort out the daytimes now\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: As in energy for work?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes and no nausea\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No nausea yes. Hopefully that is days away.\\
The energy for work I have issues with but that’s with everyone.\\What you need energy for is life plus the ability to do work.\\Rather than all energy for work and none left for life.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well yes, obviously. But I do need to have some energy for work\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you still out?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: In my hotel room living it large with a sandwich. Might go down to the bar after as I saw people.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Or might just go to bed\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Rock'n'roll\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm in bed\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well, I'm going to say night night xxxxxxxxxx\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night x x x x x x x x x x\\

Hope you sleep better. You should after your afternoon “nap” :winking-face:\\:rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: just teasing.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00013001-GIF-2024-03-16-06-43-15.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x\\
Glad you slept well :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\I can't remember last time I stayed in a hotel either.\\Do you have breakfast included?\\Ready for the day?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: No idea yet if breakfast is included. I doubt it but it will be the easiest option.\\
Just about ready. It’s about now I fully regret agreeing to give a talk at all but it will be fine.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did you not book it with your hotel room?\\
You'll smash it. What time is your presentation?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just can’t remember if it is included or not. Will find out when I go downstairs. I’ve either already paid or will have to pay.\\
9:20 I think. I’m on after the introduction. Glad it’s first. Get it done.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah fair enough. Fingers crossed it is.\\
Good. I'll be sending you presentation smashing vibes\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that's so pretty\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well at least you're getting a lovely walk in before?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah got a bit of a walk in and got lunch. Just had by disappointment £10 breakfast.\\
How it comes out of the kitchen tepid I have no idea.\\What’s your plans for the day?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I hate disappointing breakfast. Hopefully at least it filled you up.\\
I'm going to try a little nap because I was up at 5 again. Then potter around and Niall should be here at about 3.\\Still not planning loads for the days, resting mostly\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I expected the disappointment. Another thing where it should be £5.\\
Good plan for the day. Don’t hurt yourself lifting it.\\You still going to try blue grass?\\Well done on going slow. Probably the idea to do half what you think you could\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How did the presentation go??\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Went well. I think. At least it’s done. I think it helped.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Great! Well done!\\
How's the morning going?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Going well. Soooo much work I want to do. So many clever people.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aww, that sounds brilliant! Enjoy your day and I'll speak to you when you have time later xxx\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Back at the hotel. Brain fried. Good day so far.\\
How’s you day been with your friend. Sofa gone?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: The group seem to have an interesting opportunity.\\
They have a base robot designed that is for entry level. Some schools have used it but it’s not the simplest and the parts are a bit of a pain to get. There is an opportunity for us to tweak it slightly so that it works with the raspberry pi stuff.\\Which schools are apparently crying out for. If we can make it simpler to build and provide easier to understand starting software. Then we’d have a project ready robot to offer to people.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I'm glad you had a good time. I'd like to hear all about it\\
When are you off to dinner?\\Day was good. Niall's just gone and I will have to sit on the floor till midday tomorrow :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That is really interesting. Are you going to do that?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just heading out for drinks \/ dinner now.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I was telling Niall about where you were etc and turns out he does very similar stuff to you with the electronics and stuff\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’d like to help out with it. It’s essentially the next robot I want to build so would be good to combine efforts.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That would be brilliant for you :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you get food?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: There an event in Manchester end of July that could be interesting as well.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah we went to blue grass but I wasn't really able to eat much\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What did Nile think of it?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh he's been there before\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Are you spending the evening in bed or sitting on the floor?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha. Probably in bed. I wouldn't be able to get up :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Big space with no sofa\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope your dinner\/drinks is nice\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It should be. I’m at the bar waiting for people. Getting looks because I’ve grabbed a table. Need them to turn up now.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no! Are they late?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yes or I’m just thinking they might be downstairs\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: But it was loud downstairs\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They might have booked a table of there are so many of you?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: For dinner we have booked but this is just drinks\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Different place\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::old-man::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aaaaaaah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope they turn up soon\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And if I go downstairs and there not there I lose the table.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll have to look now I’ve thought about it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope they are there\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not downstairs.  This is the problem when I don’t have peoples numbers\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not even the guys from your club?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No, it never really came up. Was all email or verbal\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah bugger. Hopefully they'll be there soon\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Arrived\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Woo hoo. Enjoy!!\\

Plan for today is to see if I can get my robot to do something and see how far it goes in the maze.\\Think it will be a long day.\\How you feeling today? Any different?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Fell asleep before falling asleep??\\
Oh hopefully it all works the way it should!\\Are you all showing off your work?\\I was feeling a bit better yesterday afternoon. Nausea is still very much there but didn't get tired until about 6. But didn't have the best night. Woke up about 2am with a start and then couldn't sleep until about 4. Will see how today goes\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, I was in bed but not yet ready for sleep and drifted off. So woke holding phone and lights still on.\\
Showing off might be a stretch. People will see my work.\\Slow progress but progress then. Where is the pain level at? Is the nausea changing at all or is it very constant\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hannah absolutely broke me. My hamstrings are on fire\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no :face-with-tears-of-joy: I've done that before. How's the hotel room? Have you slept well?\\
If they will see it you are showing it!\\Yes, I feel like it's super slowly starting to level. I kind of have a baseline nausea all the time and then it spikes when I eat. And I'm still not feeling hungry so really have to remember to eat at regular intervals\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh nooooo. Hamstrings are sooo painful. Have you tried some stretches?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hotel room is as expected really. Good enough. Slept ok. Not terrible but not brilliant. Lots of waking up and going back to sleep.\\
In that case. Yes I’m showing my work :grinning-face:\\Sure, I’ve done stretching. Standing up. Sitting down.\\At least is it slowly getting better. :mending-heart:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well at least it's not terrible I guess. You'll be home late tonight won't you?\\
That's no stretching :face-with-rolling-eyes: we need to do some yoga together I think.\\Yes, definitely hoping it will level out this week. Probably a good idea that I extended the sick note even though it makes me feel so guilty\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think it’s going to be later than I’d like it to be. At least 8pm but that might be optimistic.\\
It was a good idea. Rule \#1.\\No point trying to work and not only not being able to work well which you’ll feel guilty for as well but also then feeling worse. Then it’s just a spiral.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It will be a long day for you.\\
Will you need any food dropping off?\\How's the showing going?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thank you but I have cheese at home :face-with-tears-of-joy:.\\
It’s going. I’m currently silently yelling at my code for not working while working. It’s going to be something stupid. I can feel it.\\Any sofa update?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahh. Well that's good. If you need proper food let me know.\\
Of course it's going to be something tiny, that's the rule. Hope you figure it out.\\Just waiting for them, they should be in about 15-20mins\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Looks good. Are you pleased with it?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes I am. Will need to get used to it in the space but that will happen.\\
My feet don't touch the ground when I'm sitting down :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: what about the overlord? Does he approve\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Onto the new tv unit and shelves then\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Bathroom first I think\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just leaving. Earlier than expected. So hopefully home at a much more reasonable time. I’ll have time to sit :grinning-face:\\
Will let you know when I get home.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh good leaving time. Hope the afternoon was good.\\
Have a safe journey and speak when you're back xx\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Home! Think I’ll have a bath.\\
Much better journey back, always is on a Sunday.\\Afternoon was good. I fixed one of my problems. Now I have at least 3 more to fix. Frustrating but making progress.\\Annoyingly I think I need an android device to help.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Eey welcome back. That was nice and quick.\\
Bath will be a good idea, I'm thinking the same.\\I look forward to hearing about your weekend\\Ooh android to the rescue?:rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not sure android to the rescue more Apple won’t allow the app.\\
What have you been up to? Other than sitting on the new sofa\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've got spare phones if you need?\\
That's pretty much it. I got really sick after lunch so just watched some films and worked on the blanket\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That would be helpful. Would at least let me test some stuff out.\\
Oh no. More nausea from eating?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No problem, I can give it to you next time I see you.\\
Yeah, had a really big reaction\\You're in a bath yet?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: What did you have for lunch? Do you think there is any difference taking the tablets with or without food.\\
Just in the bath now\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I had pasta.\\
I take it in the morning so doesn't matter with or without food as nausea usually hits me within like an hour anyway\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Very strange and annoying\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's one of those things I'll just have to ride out\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are we seeing each other this week?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I hope so\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okaay. Any suggestions? Do you have tutorials? Plans?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have a tutorial tomorrow 7pm and not much else for the week. I probably should try a run on Tuesday.\\
Got Hannah tomorrow at 11\\Also depends what you want to do. Could definitely see you for a little bit before PT or in afternoon and or a different evening in the week if you wanted to risk dinner\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I have hairdresser tomorrow (it's been booked for months so it's after work), but will be home all day otherwise. I am getting so so bored.\\
Would be lovely to see you in the morning.\\I don't think I'll be on shape to run on Tuesday but might try a "gentle" session in the gym.\\We could do dinner on Wednesday? Maybe even a walk? It's light until 6 now!\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I could come over before my gym session? Maybe 9:30\\
Wednesday works.\\I bet it’s boring. There is only so much sitting and tv that can be done. Would be better if it was even a tiny bit over outside\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Bit nicer\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, that would be nice.\\
Very efficient in arranging :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\I'm sick of these walls now but still get completely knackered by any kind of activity\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you want inefficient arranging?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-rolling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Everything okay? <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, just about to eat.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Are you ok? I have the sense I’ve done or not done something\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah. Why are you thinking that?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Because you asked me if I was ok.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I was just checking\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you have a bath in the end?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I did. But got interrupted by some weirdos at the side of the building loitering. I kinda got freaked out a bit so I got out. :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
What did you have for dinner?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: How did you know there was a weirdo?\\
Bit of pasta, cheese and jerky.\\Very comfy indeed\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: There were two. I heard them talking\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I had cereal :disappointed-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good to eat though\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup.\\
All unpacked?\\What are you up to for the rest of the night?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: When you say “all”?\\
Watching the blown away final and then bed. Early spin class to get to. Which will hopefully cure the hamstrings\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't know. All you brought back?\\
Are they still hurting?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ve unpacked my clothes but the rest I have not.\\
Yep, the last 2 days of barely moving bad chairs, and not drinking enough, water will not have helped\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah that's not going to help.  Make sure you pop some magnesium and pint of water before bed\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Already taken the drugs\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well done :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well I made the big move from sofa to bed. What wild life I am living\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Calm down :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: you might tire yourself out.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I took a melatonin to help with that :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Rock'n'roll\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night x x x x x x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
Hope you sleep well. Will see you in the morning :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: See you in the morning x\\
\section*{Monday $18\textsuperscript{th}$}
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00013129-GIF-2024-03-18-06-23-25.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x\\
How was spin?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00013131-GIF-2024-03-18-08-15-33.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I'm glad you're enjoying this. Shame Joseph doesn't do classes like that\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just a shame she doesn’t do more. Really would like her to at least do Thursday\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Could you ask whether she's planning on doing more classes or something like that?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was discussed at the end of the class today. The problem is that management don’t really seem to care or it’s just work they don’t want to do.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah! She might be able to put the idea forward. Or maybe if you all sent an email?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll try but I know Joseph sees the email and I’d suspect him of just deleting them. Other people agreed with me.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well that would be shitty of him\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It would. Ego issues.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: He dropped the Monday class anyway. So don’t know why he’s bothered by people enjoying it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I guess because as you said ego\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm feeling quite well this morning (haven't taken meds yet) so feel guilty I'm not at work :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What does “quite well” mean. Could you do a 2km walk, 5km run, full gym session?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm not feeling sick and could probably do the 2k walk\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So it sound like you feel better than you have. Which was total shit. That doesn’t mean your suddenly well enough or have the energy for a full day.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The point isn’t to get to the point you can grind out a days work and then be broken for the rest of the day or week.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The point is to be able to do work like it doesn’t matter so you can then do things you care about\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know you are right\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: This is very much the switch that happened to me.\\
The point isn’t to do work. The point is to do what you want. Work gets in the way but it should be the only thing your able to do\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Work will always want you to do work and work could not care at all if you do anything other than work. Work just wants more work done.\\
Do work for free at the weekend. Great. Work loves that. Work early, work late. Loves it.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's a hard switch to make. If I wasn't unwell, I would have still worked all evenings and weekends I bet\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m sure and then you either never notice or you get to a point where you ask “I thought I was going to do things”\\
Our whole culture buts everything on working and the grind of work.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Let's see how it is in the new job\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That should be very 9-5. There is always wiggle room and at the start you certainly have to play the game a bit.\\
I was more thinking let’s see what happens in 10 minutes when you take the drugs\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: True. I'm just having porridge and then I'm taking meds\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: On my way.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you manage a nap?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I did.\\
How was gym?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was good. Now my whole body is broken and I’m tired. Did get a headache as well from the loud music.\\
Feel any better from the nap?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no, was it super loud again?\\
I just woke up so still a bit woozy but I think it helped.\\Just had a message from the hairdresser saying she's not feeling well ans if we can reschedule\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Is that a good thing about rescheduling the hair?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Meh ideally it would just happen today but if it happens this week, it will be alright.\\
But now I have hours to fill in my bored life :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: What do you want to do instead? That you have the energy for.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't know :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: that's the problem\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to have some lunch.\\
What are you up to this afternoon?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ve got a bunch of house jobs to do this afternoon and some admin stuff on the computer.\\
Needs to check out what work I need to do this week as well. Plus need to shower again\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Busy afternoon for you. I need to do some jobs too I guess\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s something exciting you can do\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Living the life <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Omg that's amazing!!! Well done x\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How do you feel about it?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I'm not really sure. It gives me options which is nice. I really wasn't expecting that answer from them and this one is the "simplest" one to do as it is still done at home.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Would you do it?\\
Where else are you waiting to hear from?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I'm still waiting for a response from UCL but really I should just apply. Waiting to hear back from Herts on my application.\\
I could apply to Cardiff but I would need to live closer.\\The Liverpool one is all done remote. So would be the same as what I do now and its a 2 year course not 1 year. So arguably a better pace\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh definitely just apply to UCL. I actually thought you've already done it.\\
Which one would be the your first choice?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I am planning to apply to UCL anyway and Sussex now that I remember. Something to do over Easter I think.\\
I have no idea on my first choice. Originally it would have been Sussex but now I don't know. If I got into UCL it would almost be silly not to go there because of the weight the name has attached to it\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: side question. Do you need any shopping. I have stuff arriving on Wednesday morning\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh completely get that. UCL would be a great place.\\
Hope you get couple of options so you can have choices\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: will just have to see. Sometimes choices can be bad\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aw thank you. I'm going to do a food shop tomorrow to just get out a little. But could you add couple bottles of cordial for me.\\
I still need to send you monies for meds and car\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah that one will do great\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: your welcome\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Let me know how much they are and I'll pop all the monies over together\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: urgh, You do know i'm not worried about that. How much breakdown do you want?\\
The wiring things for the car was £24, drink is £4.7 and I think your drugs were £19.30 as that is 2x the NHS charge. The pill is free, which I didn't know but makes sense once I asked\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I just meant the cordial, I knew the rest.\\
Thank you :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\I know you're not worried about it\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You know what I was just thinking... I still haven't received the v5 for the car.. is that normal?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It could be. I’d give it another week or so.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did you manage your admin bits?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Most of them yeah. Just having an early dinner before the tutorial.\\
I am going to have to make my bed late as stuff is still in the tumble\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Having anything nice?\\
Ooh don't forget! Nothing worse than being ready for bed and having to put the sheets on\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Made my pizza as I missed out over the weekend :face-with-tears-of-joy:.\\
Need the stuff to dry first as washed my pillow.\\Did you find anything to avoid the boredom\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ooh nice! Yes, definitely needed to catch up on the pizza :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: you've got some cute little routines\\
I've done the dishes and took the bins out. Now working on the blanket. It isn't avoiding the boredom\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Glad you think my routines are cute. I do like some consistency.\\
Dishes and bins definitely won’t help with boredom. They are boring.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I like a bit of consistency myself :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
Haha yeah. But I honestly don't know what to do anymore. I'm going to get moving tomorrow.\\What's your tutorial on?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Don’t push too hard too soon but I can understand wanting to get outside.\\
I’m not really sure today. It’s a cosmology one. Might be an overview on the new book. Guess I’ll find out.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll try a little bit tomorrow. See how I go with the food shop and go from there. I had a massive fatigue attack earlier and had to have another nap. But pain wise I'm definitely better so that's something!\\
Oh I hope it's interesting tonight\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s really good about the pain. Is it anywhere near “normal” levels or still high.\\
The fatigue must be annoying and the fatigue attacks aren’t new. Well they might be new but they aren’t since new drugs.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah very much in the 'normal' ranges today. I'm really hoping this means a turn in the side effects.\\
Yeah they aren't new. It's just so weird when they came out of nowhere\\How was pizza?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I guess you’ll find out with the side effects. I wonder if the new drugs have had a chance to do anything yet.\\
The pizza is exceptional. As always :grinning-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I do think they have had an effect on the pain.\\
Well I guess you'll have to make it for me soon so I can see exactly how exceptional it is :grinning-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Survived tutorial?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, I was a nice little recap of everything so far.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Cool\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Up to much tonight?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Games. Not too bad tonight. 2 wins so far.\\
You been doing blanket?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah well done. Matt must have missed you over the weekend,:rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh well done. That looks awesome. Doesn’t the bear require more harder counting.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It does! So far I only have the snout :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, I thought it would be start with the body.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm following the pattern. Probably for the first time\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think I beat you to bed.\\
Will wish you good night. Hope you sleep ok again.\\X x x x x x x x x x x x\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm just about to get in.\\
\section*{Tuesday $19\textsuperscript{th}$}
Hope the games were good.\\Sleep well, night night. x x x x x x x x x x\\Like you\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00013219-GIF-2024-03-19-06-47-01.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x\\
Ah did the alarm not go off?\\Hope it's still good even if you're not feeling it\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh the alarm went off. Just want feeling it. Class was crap. Just a repeat of last weeks ones. Got it done though. Might need to book a massage or a physio appointment. Annoyed that my back still hurts. Need to find out the exercises I need to do.\\
How are you?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Super well done for getting it done even though you weren't feeling it!\\
Joseph doesn't seem to be caring much about those classes these days.\\I've got a brilliant osteo and a massage person - do you want contact for them? The osteo might be the best first port of call.\\I'm fine. How are you? What are you up to today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: He just seems to use the class as extended iron man training for himself. I can understand not doing new classes all the time but everyone else seems to build a routine around a track. Then you just chain tracks together. Infinite classes once you have 10 or so tracks.\\
Thanks, I might try my physio first who fixed my shoulder and then try a massage.\\Fine isn’t much of an answer :squinting-face-with-tongue:.\\I’m ok,  more tired than I would like. Got to get some work done today. Got an assignment next week and somehow thing I lost a week or just got my dates wrong. I should run later but it raining again! Might try a walk if the rain stops but will be super muddy I’m sure.\\What are your plans? Shopping?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's a good plan. Are you going to try to book for this week? Do you have a massage person?\\
Meh, I'm just tired of always telling you all the issues. You must be sick of it by now.\\What's your assignment on?\\It shouldn't rain this afternoon so hopefully it will be dry for your run. I wish I could go too but I'm not there yet.\\Honestly not sure about plans yet. Just washed my hair, will definitely pop to Aldi and then not sure\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Urgh, I actually have to phone someone. Will call and see when they have an appointment and go from there. I don’t have a massage person.\\
I need to check but I have to write some report on the exoplanet we found. I think I’ve done the fun part of the assignment and now onto the boring writing part.\\I’m not “sick of it” just want to know if your improving, same, getting worse, etc.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You might have to do that. I do my appointments by messages :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Oh good that already have some bits done. Is it going to be loads of hours of work to finish it?\\Sorry, I'm just having a little bit of a dip in terms of head. Couldn't sleep last night and woke up already having a little spiral\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think it might take ages to get it finished or even get to the start. I need to look but I think there is more work until the work starts. I’ve got the time. It will be fine. Just need to work out the path first.\\
Oh that’s a pain. I might be imagining a pattern but I don’t think this is the first time you had a good nights sleep a couple of naps and then a shit nights sleep. And it’s not like you didn’t need the naps. Like your brain is punishing you for being rested.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully it all goes smoothly for you.\\
No, I think you're right. It's just a pain when I get a fatigue attack and can't help but sleep. I'm going to try not to nap if I can today and see what happens\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: How did shopping go?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well, I survived. But I definitely have some empirical evidence that I primarily feel fine and ready to take on the world from the couch, rather than whilst doing anything.\\
How's your morning been?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: so does that mean you feel less guilty about not going to work?\\
Predictably slow. I may have got side tracked writing up my thoughts for the robot clubs new school friendly version of a robot we could make. While it is all fresh in my mind\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes :face-with-rolling-eyes:. I know it's better to be resting. My head is ready to be doing things but my body needs to catch up\\
Ah you wanted to do that anyway so it's good you got it down on paper while still in your head.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, it needed doing or at least I wanted to do it anyway.\\
What's your plans for the rest of the day now you've risked going outside\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Now it's done you can focus on other bits.\\
I don't know. Currently fighting going for a nap so I started working on the teddy again\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Aww, good excuse not to move. How’s the bear going or has cat delayed progress\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: image omitted\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It is a good excuse but I'm very thirsty :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
How's work going?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: oh well done. You may have to wake the beast for a drink though. No doubt he will then sulk and leave you alone.\\
Work is ok. One of the activities they want you to do is very long and pointless. I checked on the group and someones tutor already said not to bother with it :man-facepalming:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I did end up waking him and now he's not talking to me :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Why are they making you do a pointless activity?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, cats!\\
I have no idea. It would be a good learning thing but its not marked or tested\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: For practice I guess.\\
Hopefully the rest is more interesting\/useful\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you going to do the run? It's all sunny outside\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Its sunny outside but I saw Lynne's post on the group and sunset is 6:15. I really should run but I really dont want to run in the wet\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Go ooon. You can do it!\\
I'm trying to live vicariously through you :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: If me going for a run in the dark and damp is living vicariously, I think you need loftier dreams :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i'm going to hate either choice so I might as well run. I really only want to do a couple of km\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm confined at the moment, I get my kicks where I can :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You will feel better for it. I really wish I could come with\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: not sure about "feel better". Less guilty sure. Not sure about feeling better\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The running endorphins and all that! You will be on cloud nine\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I'm not sure I have any. Think I broke them. Normally i'm just glad its over\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: A little positivity please :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: oh ok. Yes i'm super excited to go for a run. It will be great and ill feel great after\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha. I can feel the sarcasm dripping from that sentence all the way here :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i tried :man-shrugging: :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm looking forward to seeing you tomorrow. Hopefully we can do the walk?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: If i can still walk after running my marathon later :face-with-tears-of-joy: but yes that would be nice. We can just go over the road and walk by the stream \/ river\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: My hairdresser is at 1.30. hopefully I won't be too late\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How long should it take?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: God knows. Maybe 3 hours\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: WHAT! to colour and barley cut\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, yes\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It takes a long time for us\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00013265-GIF-2024-03-19-16-03-31.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: we might be tight on light then but will have to see. I assume you will need to go home feed the fluffy bastard then come over\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You mean my fluffy baby boy??\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: that's the one\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-rolling-eyes::face-with-rolling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah ideally I'd do that\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you looking forward to spending some time together tomorrow?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: obviously. Why wouldn't you think so\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I just sometimes like to be told\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yes i am looking forward to seeing you tomorrow and us spending time together\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I was going loopy so I went for a walk.\\
Hope the run is good\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done. We will see. If I can get a couple of km done then that’s good.\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Woo hoo. Well done! How was it?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was running. Not sure why but I can feel my back today. Which make no sense to me. In fairness the last bit I did on my own wasn’t awful.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You still went. You still did it. Step by step. Like I said, a bit of positive thinking :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That last sentence from my message was extremely positive\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah\\
"Extremely" :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What are you up to tonight?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Need to cook dinner and then some games I think.\\
Looking forward to a bit of a lie in tomorrow and see you of course.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Has the food nausea got any different?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hmmm, not really. I'm still not feeling hungry until the dizziness hits me\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Where is the wonk?\\
First time is always the worst. In theory :winking-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's all wonky, the stitches :smiling-face:\\
Need to get some practice in\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thoughts\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you sleep any better?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh cool. Will be interesting to try it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It still took me a while to fall asleep but I think I slept through most of the night\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How are you?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s good that you slept through. Do you feel better than yesterday’s sleep.\\
I’m ok. Haven’t actually moved yet :grinning-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No, pretty much the same. Just maybe a little longer\\
Ah well you don't have to. It's your lay in day\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I guess not enough tries to see if skipping the nap helped at all\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You doing anything this morning before hair\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll try again today\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not much, just pottering around.\\
What's your plan for today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Got to get up :grinning-face:\\
Breakfast and then work. Got shopping arriving this morning so I can see what I’ve forgotten.\\Might do a little walk at lunch or just wait for our walk later.\\Looking forward to seeing you.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh getting up is overrated :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
I'll keep you updated about my timings. Hopefully I'll manage to get back in time\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hope hair goes well.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, thank you.\\
How's your day going?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I finally got up :face-with-tears-of-joy:, shopping arrived. Have done some work. Which they made harder than it should have been.\\
Got to do some house work this afternoon so I don’t get mega judged later on :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh you're so productive!\\
I don't mega judge :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You don’t mega judge because I tidy up :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s a good view for the afternoon\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's such a chilled place here\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've finished already. Shall I just drive straight to you?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sorry just seen this. You can. I need to shower.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't worry. Just got home\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: When do you want to come over?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I can head out in a minute? All showered?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just about to jump in. You can let yourself in if im not ready\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okie doke. There's traffic so won't be super quick\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Home and beast fed. I got very much told off for my untimely arrival.\\
Thank you for a lovely afternoon\/evening\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I bet he was fuming :face-with-steam-from-nose:\\
Very much enjoyed seeing you.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you doing games for the rest of the evening?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No, just watching some TV but might okay about with some work numbers.\\
Are you drugged up? Alarm set.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not yet, just having a little cuddle with the furry beast.\\
Don't work too late\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: No chance of that tonight.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Of working late?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, won’t be working late. At least need to turn the computer off and that might be it.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah that's good. Relax, you've got an early start anyway\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That where the thought process has ended up. Suprisingly tired given the late start.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well, I might have something to do with that :winking-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Maybe. It was unexpected\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Unexpected good I hope\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well yes. Obviously good.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just checking\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Right, drugged up, alarm set and in bed\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning xxxxxxx\\
Woke up in the middle of the night again for about an hour :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\How did you sleep?\\Hope spin is good!\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh no. At least it was only an hour I guess. How did you know it was an hour :thinking-face:\\
Maybe it all kicks in with 2 or more orgasms. 1 isn’t enough.\\For a shit class it was ok. Very busy.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Because I got up for loo.\\
Maybe. :winking-face:\\It's was the short one wasn't it?\\What are you up to today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Short class yeah.\\
Today. I think I need to go to the shops because I cannot adult properly and I don’t have the stuff for my dinner :man-facepalming: but I do need to go to the post office anyway. Then it just work. Will go for a quick walk at lunch. Got to make dinner which will be a batch. That’s about it. Maybe games but Matt wasn’t sure if he was free. If not then I might try some robot stuff.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I was going to ask if you fancied going for a walk again tomorrow lunch but I think the weather is going to ruin it.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no, what did you forget?\\
Sounds like a productive day. I'm just getting ready for Steph. Really not feeling it\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Is it supposed to rain? If not I'd definitely like to go\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I definitely forgot onions and need to check the recipe as I’m sure there is something else.\\
Well don’t go mad. Just get the body moving.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep, full on rain storm :cloud-with-lightning-and-rain: about 10am\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Will see what Steph has cooked up :grimacing-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh nooo. I'm supposed to see Becky in the morning too :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Inside coffee then for tomorrow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Or just a rainy dog walk :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have booked the yew tree for 6pm Saturday\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aw thank you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: She killed me. Gently. Honestly, I am soaked\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: In a good way?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Nap time then\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It was good to be there but I am super weak\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to see agi in an hour\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was post office?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not been yet. Going to go before lunch and combine it with my walk.\\
Basically I’m try to optimise  it changing clothes twice.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, good plan!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Home from Agi's now and definitely need a nap :sleeping-face:\\
How's your day going?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you have fun?\\
Days going ok. Post office was a faff and I didn’t even have to go. They try to pick up post now. Got it sorted.\\Got my cosmology assignment back and did really well 87\%. Very pleased with that.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It was nice. Haven't seen Agi in ages but I am knackered now.\\
Oh what do you mean they try to pick up post now?\\We haven't had a postman come all week here and I'm waiting for stuff\\Oh that is amazing. Super well done! You smashed it :smiling-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You having a nap now then?\\
When you now buy postage online they default to wanting to pick it up for you. You have to go all the way to the end of the process before you can say that you will drop it off.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I tried but only dozed on and off.\\
Aaah ok. Didn't know that was a thing\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did the dozing help at all?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: A little. At least I was resting I guess.\\
How's the assignment going?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: its going. I keep thinking I have written loads and then look down at the word count. It doesn't seem to be getting higher but I think its going ok. Had to get a few ducks in a row first. There is this whole citing papers thing we need to get right and I might have gone too far in setting up some software to make it easier.\\
Still not quite sure if what I am writing is the right stuff.\\They want us to try and "add" something to the data we collected but i'm not sure how we do that given we have just confirmed things we already knew. Maybe that is it. An extra confirmation. Probably going to give it a little bit longer and then start cooking dinner. The afternoon has blown by.\\What wild plans do you have?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Assignments are hard work. You're doing well, and writing one every two weeks is tough.\\
What are the forums saying about the "adding" something?\\What are you making for dinner?\\Oh so so wild. I'm going to clean the flat a little, it's a mess. Probs do some laundry etc. Rock'n'roll\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I've not seen a lot on the forums about the extra that can be added. Its a fine line between helping and just giving people the answer. Might just need the brain to sit on it for a while.\\
Making my hidden veg butter chicken curry. Takes a good hour to make and will no doubt ruin what was a briefly clean kitchen.\\That still pretty busy stuff to get done. Is the bear nearly finished?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Fresh eyes and brain always help.\\
Oh that sounds really yum. I'm not sure what I'm going to have. Fancy some kind of soup I think.\\Not yet, still needs both legs, an arm and ears. It's really shody work :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: will probably start another straight away.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: at least if you make all of the mistakes on this one. Spud can have a new toy to play with and then you'll know what to do on the next one.\\
Have you already got the soup or do you need to make it?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's a good way to look at it!\\
I need to make it :face-with-rolling-eyes: but I just realised I haven't had lunch today....\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: well its too late for lunch now :face-with-tears-of-joy:. Not even hungry after the gym?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I had breakfast after gym.\\
I'm still not really feeling hunger ( which is soooo weird)\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: that is strange. That's what I need tablets for but without the nausea feeling\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I still haven't lost any weight :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: and it's been a week and half of this.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That's even weirder if you havn't lost any weight. That make even less sense\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know\\
Maybe because I'm still forcing myself to eat at least 3 meals and I haven't really been moving\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, if you’ve not skipped any then that would explain it. Except today’s lunch.\\
Countered the not moving though.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I mean I've skipped a lot of snacking :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Having a good evening?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Its been ok. Cooking went well. Nearly fell asleep on the sofa. I swear some video I watch have music that just puts me to sleep.\\
Just finished playing games. Overall a bit of a total disaster but 2 really good wins. So we either died straight away and could win a single gun fight or we win. Very odd.\\Just about to sort out my protein shake for the morning and then I think I will go to bed.\\Hows yours been?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha. Fell asleep or was resting your eyes?\\
Ah well done on the partial success of gaming\\Do you have Hannah in the morning?\\It's been fine, pottered around cleaning then made food and then been slaving over half an arm and one leg :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: somewhere in between asleep and resting.\\
Today was not a relaxing gaming session :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\Yep, got Hannah at 7:30. Will see what horrors she has instore this week. I'm suspecting squats.\\You made soup then?\\Got one leg done at least. I'm guessing the limbs take longer to make than the body even though they are smaller?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, when are they relaxing?\\
Ah nice! I'm sure she'll try to disable your legs.\\I've swapped my morning walk for afternoon coffee\\I did. I have this pho kit so I made that. It was nice. I'm going to make the Moroccan veg one this weekend.\\Yeah, they are more of piply work\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I guess I don’t really play relaxing games. The professionals make it look so easy.\\
Well she properly broke them last week.\\What time are you doing your coffee then?\\I’ll just nod and agree with you about the bear work :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Living the rock and roll life I’m in bed already so I think I get to which a good night first for a change.\\
Night x x x x x x x\\Like you loads and I think you’re amazing.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha I guess you don't :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Well you do day it's not worth paying for it if she doesn't destroy you\\I'm meeting the girls at 3.30 and then the other girls at 6 :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\Haha, like me and robot stuff.\\It's just a lot of changing and counting and stuff\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night. Sleep well x x x x x x x x\\
I like you really loads too :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Other girls? Where you going at 6?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Front room, Katie and the lot\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh. Busy day for you then\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully a slow, chilled morning though\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Should be.\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x\\
Oh I definitely can. I did wake up but I think I slept better than last night.\\Hope your session is good. Enjoy!\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s good, about the sleep. Maybe it needs to be a combination of gym and orgasms to maximise the sleep :winking-face:\\
Session was suitable brutal. Did some squats but back nerve thing is still there so we switches it up into super awful core work.\\The rain has buggered our walk, as predicted.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I don't think I can do both in one day :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Oh that's not good. I'll ask Lyddi if she has any appointments next week when I see her tomorrow.\\Stupid rain.\\What are you up to this morning?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I mean we’d have to work out the order but one of them doesn’t necessarily require a lot of physical effort on your part.\\
That would be good. Thank you.\\Just sat down with my coffee and breakfast. Then got to choose. Need to do work but should I keep going with what I’ve been doing. Which is probably the better answer or switch gears and do the cosmology work. I’m thinking if I can get my assignment 80\% finished today then I can tweak it next week and just focus on the cosmology.\\What are you doing before your mega social butterfly afternoon\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha. Get in there with logic and planning :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
I think the 80\% plan might be a good idea.\\I'm going to rest a little and the potter around, shower, hair just bits and pieces\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: The variables are which order and time of day. All in the pursuit of good sleep of course.  Might break you for the whole day though once it’s all done.\\
Maybe gym which would tire you out a bit then just tie you to the bed (so as to not use up for energy). Then go for for 3 or 4+ orgasms. Maybe allow a 20 minute nap :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\Maybe not even gym. Park run, lunch, afternoon of sex and see how that goes. That’s only 3 things.\\Then the sex first, work, gym combo. Probably more likely in the new job on a WFH day.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You have it all planned out :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just a couple of ideas that came to mind :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your day going? Managed what you needed on the assignment?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Day's going ok. Took a while to get started. Haven't yet got as far as I would have liked but progress is being made. I have to get past the mental block I seem to have when writing reports.\\
How about you? All set for coffee with Becky?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I get what you mean. It always took me ages to get started on writing papers. But the good the is that progress is being made.\\
I am super tired and sleepy today, don't know why. But I'm starting to feel a bit hungry and peckish which I guess is good.\\Yup, will be leaving in a bit. Even though I'm only thinking about being back in bed\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That's possible good if your feeling hungry. Have you felt hungry at all since last Monday?\\
Have you eaten today?\\Did you have a nap this morning? Maybe you'll wake up a bit once you get outside. Certainly less sun today and you do seem to be a lot like a flower. Powered by sun light :grinning-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not really, a little yesterday but definitely feeling peckish today. I have had breakfast and lunch and only had a some nausea.\\
Yeah I did have about half an hour.\\Haha yes, I am definitely powered by sunlight, so much better in spring and summer :grinning-face-with-sweat:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is hopefully an improvement then if the hunger is starting to come back to normal. Small steps.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: maybe some daylight bulbs on your flat? I know you like to live in the dark but it might help\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I was thinking about this. I do want to get that alarm clock thing and a daylight lamp\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: are they the same thing or 2 different things?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think they might be two different things.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think your kitchen light could be improved. It quite dark at the cooker end\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yeah I don't like that fitting at all\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: \url{https://www.telegraph.co.uk/recommended/home/best-wake-light-alarm-clocks/} as a starting point.\\
Just a smidge more expensive than I thought an LED would be\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah they are quite pricey.\\
Just got into town. What are you up to tonight?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: How was coffee?\\
Not 100\% sure yet. Might try some robot stuff or just watch TV. Will decide once ive had food.\\Hope you have a good evening :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Lovely seeing girls. Patri is traveling for like 6 weeks now so good to catch her.\\
Just in front room now.\\What are you having for dinner?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: My leftovers from yesterday :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Enjoy :smiling-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, enjoy\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: <attached: 00013455-GIF-2024-03-22-18-04-41.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm home.\\
I was too brave and have eaten. Not the right choice\\What are you getting up to?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh no, what went wrong?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Currently watching the end of the equilizer 3\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just think I jinxed it telling you the nausea was going away\\
Came back with vengeance :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oooh how is it? I wanted to watch it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, that’s no fun. It must have heard you talk about it.\\
It’s pretty good. Much more like the first one than the second. I think they cut a lot of it out or I have blinked and missed bits. Some of the character development fast forwarded it a bit off screen.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Does the front room do dinner then? I looked it up and all I could tell was it is a late night cafe.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Must have.\\
Maybe you rested your eyes for a bit?:rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah, kind of. They are now open late thur-sat and they do beers, wines and cocktails and like fancy sandwiches and grazing boards and stuff\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I looked away while eating and it’s not helped with having to have subtitles on as half of all the speech is in Italian.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aaaah, yeah that makes sense\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I was thinking about tomorrow. Pick you up at 5.30?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah that works. Could be earlier if you like?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It should only be about 15mins drive but I can come earlier\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Becky said it's a really nice place\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s good. It doesn’t look far away either.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How’s the nausea?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not great. Had peppermint tea and sparkling water but bit budging. Have you finished the film?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah film done. It was ok. Some of it felt forced. Watching some YouTube and then might go to bed.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Clock making or soldering?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, not this time. It’s a game channel where this guy plays games I’d like to play but he is better and faster.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've always wondered, what is it that is so interesting about watching a video of someone else playing a game?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I can only speak for myself. With Warzone it about watching really good player do really well. So it’s a bit of learning to try and see how I can improve at playing.\\
For the one I’m watching now it’s a game I’d like to play but I know it’s a massive time hole. This guy plays games really well and cuts out the boring bits.\\I’ve never got into watching any of the live streams of games. It’s just not fast enough.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aaah okay. Thank you for explaining :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have also watched people play scary games I would never play. Less scary if someone else is doing it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, I love how you can't play scary games\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Had resident evil on the play station. Unplayable. Way too scary.\\
I did used to play 7 days to die and that used to shit me up.\\I’m such a wuss with jump scare stuff. Even if I know it’s coming.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Omg I love playing Resident Evil. I've got like 4 different ones for the xbox\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I can watch it being played\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I love the films too\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The films I like.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: They are not consistent\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nah, they are films\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I still have half a leg and ears left\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Your doing well then\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ears sound easier than limbs\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Still all need stuffing etc\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did you make it to bed?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: just pottering my way there now :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm rubbing off on you :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: there is an obvious "rubbing off" joke there that I cannot form but yes you are. I need to add more focus onto sleep, water and eating\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I mean yes, I would also like to be rubbing ON you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: This late in the evening! :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okay okay\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Maybe slightly earlier\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have made it to bed. 22:13 on a Friday :face-with-rolling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Me too.\\
What a wild life we are living\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: C.r.a.z.y\\
Should do good though.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You just got you massage tomorrow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes\\
And a lovely evening with you\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Plus pottering I assume\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Always\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope you sleep well.\\
Night night x x x x x x x x x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You too. Night x x x x x x x x x x\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x\\
Haha yes - did you sleep well?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think so.\\
How about you? Does your watch give you a graph for the week?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think I slept okay. Woke up at 3\/4 again but managed to fall back asleep\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, that’s a shame it doesn’t do a bar graph of each day like the daily pie chart.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You all set for your touching?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah, would be helpful\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just had breakfast and will go for a shower. When are you heading to your parents'?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :eyes:\\
Planning to be there for 10:30. Also planning to do a little run before I go.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you going to do parkrun?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not today. Not sure I could do the distance with this stupid never in my back and the course is just a disaster.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Is there any days in particular I should ask Lyddi about for the appointment?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Probably not Monday but see what she has.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki, will do\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: When are you running?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: At some point in the next hour. Just need to get moving really\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, you can do it!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've asked Lyddi and she has\\
Wednesday at 11am\\Thursday 2pm or 2.30pm\\Say hello to parentals\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Could I get Wednesday 11am?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll tell her. It's £65 for an hour - is that okay?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep, do I need an hour or is an hour all she does?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think she might do 30mins too but I think hour might be better. But absolutely up to you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Let go for an hour then. Mainly just need the back looking at.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. I did mention it to her and she said she'll do some testing to see if it's nerve or muscle\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How are the parents?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: They are good. Mum was very thrilled and very thankful for the gloves. Very impressed\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aww I'm glad she liked them :smiling-face-with-heart-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Liddy asked for your number and email so you can fill in the consultation form. Which email do I give her?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: paul-buzzby@hotmail.com\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh and you're booked in for the Wednesday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Brilliant thank you.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Back home now.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I might have dozed off :grimacing-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did you have a good time?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Is that before or after you took cloths off and laid in bed :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah it was nice. Just normal chats really. Heard about their weekend away last week\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Didn't take my clothes off :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did they have a good time away?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: They seemed to. They did have an incident with a bus where they either got on the wrong bus or the bus driver just straight up lied. So a 10 minute trip ended up taking over an hour.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just another story about how busses are bad\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How’s the nausea today?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: not all buses are bad\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Up and down really. Thought the nap might have helped but no\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did you get an email from liddy?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: All busses are bad. Even the air port ones.\\
Yes I have seen her email but not read it yet. Will do once I get to my computer\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's a very strong statement! Do we have some bus trauma in there?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So the nausea isn’t linked to tiredness? Doesn’t appear to be linked to food or is it always worse after eating? Timing doesn’t seem to be a factor\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No it isn't.\\
It's always there but tends to get worse after food and timing definitely doesn't matter\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Buses don’t go where you want to go. They take forever to get near where you want to go and they are expensive.\\
If 2 people want to go somewhere it’s almost the same price to get a taxi and the taxi picks you up and takes you where you want to go\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you felt hungry today? Maybe it will be 3 weeks for some of the side effects to bugger off,\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Maybe not in Wycombe but I have generally had very good experiences with public transport\/buses\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No I haven't. They say about 4 for the nausea so hopefully not much longer\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It is mainly the Wycombe busses that I dislike.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh they are shit\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Second week of Easter then will be the test for the new “normal” then\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thoughts on these \url{https://www.myoddballs.com/collections/bamboo-boxer-shorts}\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oddballs are supposed to be very good. I was looking at their women's range.\\
Your bum would look great in them\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: the women's range looks very good!\\
It was that boring moment when I realised I cannot remember how long ago I bought my last set and that some now have holes. Could probably do with a refresh. Like my socks\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: yeah the holey ones need to go in the bin :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
And the bamboo fabric is really breathable and good with sweat\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: if you look to order use code\\
UNI20-xfdbgyeh\\For 20\% off. Student discount\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you.\\
I don't think I'll be ordering any time soon but if I do I'll ask for a code :smiling-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You still aiming for 5:30?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah. Is that ok?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep, not sure where the afternoon has gone.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I had a silly thought that’s too late now. Maybe could have tried you staying over but realised that works badly if it goes wrong as you have school on Monday.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Plus you’d have to suffer the F1 in the morning\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha I did think about it. Maybe we could try on Thursday?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m out Thursday night.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: But we can try at some point over Easter\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh is that the Lester night?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah and an old work friend\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: For some reason I thought that was Friday\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I can head over in a min if ok?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Your carriage awaits :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Home!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done. Really enjoyed seeing you this evening.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You trying melatonin for tonight?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Me too. But then again I always love spending time with you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Might do a little. Are you doing anything else tonight?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have no idea. Probably just watch some TV.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: See what you tube has to offer\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Everything\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That I haven’t already seen :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You haven't seen everything!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also, forgot to say, you are very welcome to tell me I'm special :winking-face::smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Only if you take it positively\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Of course!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: In bed now :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What YouTube wonders did you end up watching?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Watched a warzone video and now watching a guy see if you can make 3D printer filament out of hot melt glue sticks.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah nice! Can you make that?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No and so far I don’t think I’d want to. Interesting idea to be able to fully print T-shirt transfers.\\
The whole idea of making filament at home seems to be a huge waste of time and money. Just send plastic to be recycled and buy new.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah fair enough. I really don't know enough about 3d printing\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s a bit of a black hole. I can show you more of it if you can stomach being in that messy room.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes I'd like that :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hopefully the things I’ve printed for my brother show case a cool approach. Low volume car bits. As I’ve printed some speaker mounts for a customer he has next week.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yeah the Porsche bits?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s it. There is definitely a market for car bits.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That would be cool if you got commissions for bits like that\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to say night night. Hope you sleep well x x x x x x x x\\
Like you. Like really\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
\section*{Sunday $24\textsuperscript{th}$}
Like you as well. Seriously\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00013615-GIF-2024-03-24-07-54-54.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x\\
Not yet, just having breakfast.\\Did you sleep well?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Seems so just the unexpected wake up. I think the sun now coming through the curtains is waking me up.\\
What time you meeting the girls? How’s the walk working if Jenny has to run?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Maybe because you went to bed earlier?\\
Meeting at 10 at the rye. Jenn is also walking, not running :smiling-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh you know what I've been thinking about all morning?:rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have no idea.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: So you know when you were talking about the robot and saying your little one is not driving well\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: When you showed me the other one, it was going through the maze. Is it that you had to write different kind of software for the smaller one?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: My new one (smaller one) is used the same software just with a few parameters changed so that the software knows the smaller size of the robot\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah okay. So why is it having a harder time navigating the maze?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s really the hardware that is different on the new one. Not the software\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have no idea. The driving problem is a tuning issue because of different size and motors.\\
Why it hitting the wall I have no idea. I need to get more data from the robot while it moving. That why I need to get Bluetooth working. So I can output the decisions it’s making in real time and \/ or write stuff to a file\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: These are my Sunday morning thoughts :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I didn’t know what you were thinking but my robot wouldn’t have been the guess\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm just trying to understand it more. I am absolutely not able to offer any kind of help but it is interesting\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It can be very helpful explaining problems to someone\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You can always explain everything to me\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did Toria and Dan have a good evening yesterday?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have no idea. Not had a message from her. I’m sure I’ll find out on Monday.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I thought she might have messaged you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I thought she might of as well but I suspect they really wanted to watch married at first sight\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also, I was surprised you watch that\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ve seen it. I wouldn’t say I watch it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It too strung out\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I liked the first series of “love is blind” on Netflix but even that seemed to create drama for the show rather than  be about the experiment\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah that's the thing with "reality" TV, always has high drama bits scripted in\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I used to really like “don’t tell the bride” it was just so stupid and showed that people really didn’t have much of a clue about things. Funny though <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yeah I watched that a few times. Always made me so sad for the bride tgough\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s such a small amount of money they get.\\
They always have the bridge being shown around a venue twice the price of the budget with a cut to the groom renting a field\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I only saw one go horribly wrong and it looked like they needed to break up anyway\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Back in those days you could do quite a bit with 10grand\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Quite a bit yes but not rent out a castle\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha of course not\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Plus the £6k wedding dress the bride always wanted\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well the producers always played everything up\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Gotta make good tv\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: True true\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you lounging in bed?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: For now yeah, waiting to go downstairs and put race on\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah you still have time\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Got an hour but will need to find drinks and snacks\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I would like to wake up in the same place with you one of these days\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That would be nice, then we could be doing other stuff as well as talking\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We could be cuddling too :winking-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Exactly\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sue is picking me up :smiling-face:\\
I'll let you know what the plan is if you're still okay coming to get me later?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s better.\\
Yes I can pick you up. Have fun.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
Enjoy the race!\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hope the walk is going well.\\
Race was pretty good and an unexpected result, which is a nice change.\\Not sure if I should say or not but I really want you today :winking-face: I want you all the time anyway but more so today.\\I know nothing will happen until next weekend at the earliest.\\You’re smart, interesting, quirky, beautiful, sexy and cute.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Awwwww. You should always say. I know it might not always be obvious but I do want you all the time too.\\
:smiling-face-with-hearts::smiling-face-with-hearts: You're very clever and handsome and lovely and amazing too!\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I just got to Marlow and ordered some lunch so should maybe be an hour and half or so? Does that work for you?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, you’re not obvious at all plus I’d never want to assume so in my mind it a lot safer to always play it on the safe side and just assume you’re not being obvious.\\
I’m just about to eat lunch so that time works. Where do you want picking up from?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Rule \#2. I'm always interested in you.\\
What time will you be able to pick me up?\\I can wait in the Lidl carpark?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Rule \#2 is assume positive intent not I want to take you pants off.\\
I can be in Marlow in 30 minutes or longer.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 30 mins would be great if that works\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So 13:50?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Girls are just leaving so whenever you can\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh ok. I can be sooner\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you. Let me know when you're leaving\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Leaving now\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Got home okay?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep, just about to try out some robot stuff.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good! Hope it works\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thanks. We will see what I can get working. Have decided on a bath or not?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No I think I'll go for shower today. Might try a tiny cat nap just to get a little rest\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you manage a cat nap?\\
The phone works. Thank you :beaming-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\Have managed to get data going from mouse to phone and back again.\\Now "just" got to figure out how to add it into the mouse code\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I did (probably shouldn't have) and I have also succumbed to a bath.\\
Oh I'm so glad it works :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: I'm sure you figure it out, you are quite good at all this robot stuff!\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: the bath is defiantly a good idea and you probably needed the nap.\\
I'll figure it out somehow. People are already doing it so at least I know its possible. Need to let the cogs turn.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah the bath was good. Wish my water tank was bigger.\\
Are you spending your evening roboting?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just started a couple of games then will get dinner. Brain is fried for robots.\\
You could always run the shower for more hot water?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah good. Enjoy a little chill\\
I'm going to potter and get stuff ready for tomorrow and then probably read a little.\\Aaah you know how shit my shower is, it doesn't get that hot, I'd just be topping up with lukewarm water\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What's for dinner?\\
I'm nauseous again so not sure what to have\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You have a full size water tank though? That should easy do a bath.\\
It’s Sunday. Cheese is dinner.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I think it is. It's definitely not enough if I've done dishes and washed in the morning.\\
Hahaha. Oh you've missed out on your Saturday pizza yesterday :face-screaming-in-fear:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh that will do it then with the water. I turn my water on when I use it so it doesn’t cool the tank.\\
Yep missed pizza :face-screaming-in-fear:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah not having a boiler is crap. But hey ho.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: If you don’t have an economy 7 circuit it might be better to just leave the water on\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The box is old old economy 7 one. Like from 1986. There's no option for having the water 'on'\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh so it’s economy 7 over night for your water. My flat had an override that used to”normal” electric\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah.\\
I'm going to try to sort out the smart meter over Easter\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You pottered all the way to bed yet?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just now! And acquired a headache on the way.\\
How did the games go?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Why did you pick that up :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
I’d guess you’re starting to (or amplifying) worrying about school?\\Games were super sweaty. So rubbish. Just had no rhythm or flow.\\Were you annoyed at me earlier? I’m not really sure why but I got the sense I’d either done\/said or not done\/ said something I should have while I was at the flat.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: When?\\
I have definitely not been annoyed at you today or any day that I remember. What made you think that?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok that’s good. I’m not really sure, it might have been the TV thing and then at the ends with words.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Bubs you know I was teasing when you were leaving. Of course it would be super cute if you were telling me all those things but I was saying it in a jokey way. Definitely not annoyed :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok, I did think at the end you were teasing but not at the start. Whole body went into fight or flight.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I'm sorry\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m pretty sure it’s  it your fault\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Please tell me when things like that happen so you don't have to sit with it for hours\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Pretty sure it's my fault?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The only analogy that half makes sense for me trying to explain it is imagine you were attacked by a dog. That’s just one dog that did it. But you’d be wary of all other dogs even if everyone said that a dog wouldn’t bite you. You’d still think it could.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: OMG my fault\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We need to work on this. You can't continue to think I'm going to "bite" you based on past experience because I can do everything and it still won't be enough to persuade you - I'm saying this in the calmest voice and with all the love in my heart\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I do get where you're coming from, I absolutely do, I've got my own issues but I would really love for you to let me in\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know. I am really trying.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What are the other things you've typed and deleted?:rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I saw the typing\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Nothing, I just hesitated on the send button. Overthought that it’s been too long I should have wrote more then hit send before I waited any longer\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Awww\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Cards on the table policy please\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I do genuinely want to know what you're thinking, good or bad\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's the only way we can grow together\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s quite a big wall for me to take down. Good stuff is fine but me talking about my weaknesses is tough\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Brick by brick then\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is what I’m trying to do\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm in this for the long haul if you are\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I would like to be\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You're not at the moment but you would like to be?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not sure why I phrased it weirdly. Yes I am in for the long haul\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, good!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Because I've grown quite fond of you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Aww,\\
I like you a scary amount. Which is why I keep thinking that I’ve messed up or am ruining it. Which I know then doesn’t help. I really don’t want to mess this up.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I like you a scary amount too .\\
I don't want to mess this up either. Which means we really need to talk about things and not let anything fester\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: In my defence I didn’t let it fester very long\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Still longer than necessary :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s fair.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We'll work through things\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sorry, I’ve made you late to bed now.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't apologise\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'd always rather neither of us goes to bed worried or anxious about anything\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But I am going to try to get some sleep and hope this headache goes\\
Night night x x x x x x x x x x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you take any drugs?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I meant to ask earlier have you sorted morning drugs out\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I took a little melatonin ans ibuprofen for the head\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good luck. School will be fine.\\
Only 4 days till holiday.\\Night x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've filled my pill box on Friday so I'm all set for the week\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Nerd.\\
Well done :grinning-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: what can I say :woman-shrugging-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not much. Go to sleep :squinting-face-with-tongue:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am. Night x x x x x x\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x\\
Just having my breakfast. Was a hard get up this morning at 5am.\\How did you sleep?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Pretty sure I was snoring a lot but otherwise ok. I should have gone to bed earlier but that isn’t new either.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How do you know you were snoring a lot?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Slightly sore throat and dry mouth when I woke up. I need to find and order one of those snoring gum shield things or try again with the tape\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah yes, that's a good indicator. Oh let me know if you find one, I'll try it too\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What do you need it for?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Snoring\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well yes but your snoring doesn’t wake me up\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, that's true\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope spin is good!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Should be :crossed-fingers:\\
Hope you survive school\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00013762-GIF-2024-03-25-08-20-30.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah well done!\\
I'm here and not crying. I think that's the best I can offer\\What's the plan for today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not crying is always a good start. Any suffering from yesterday’s walk?\\
I’ve got Hannah at 11 and want to finish my assignment if I can. That’s about it. Would have added a walk but it’s horrid outside so that’s a pass.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you want to drop in on your way home for a drink?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The headache is back with a vengeance :face-with-rolling-eyes:\\
How was your session with Hannah?\\Is it raining in Wycombe?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I can do. I'll let you know when I'm leaving. Do you have tutorial tonight?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’d blame the children for the headache. You’ve had a very quiet 2 weeks.\\
Currently not raining but it was this morning.\\Session was brutal as always. We have switched to super sets and lots of small muscle work. So much more pain and suffering :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: The enthusiasm :face-with-tears-of-joy:. Only if you fancied it.\\
No tutorial today.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's so loud!\\
Glad you had a good sesh. Make sure you stretch *properly*\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: There was enthusiasm , thank you very much! I do fancy it but will have to asses sickness level post lunch\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: We did quite a bit of stretching today.\\
See how you feel at the end of school. If you rather just go home and collapse I completely understand.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I wasn’t going mental at dinner on Saturday. Hannah had spelt it Maya in a facebook post by mistake and then edited it. It’s meant to be and is Miya.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. I'll let you know when I'm leaving. Need to start staying for a bit now to sort out things. Most staff now seems to know so keep asking me how I am. Just about to tell my form :grimacing-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah there you go! You were both right.\\
Did Toria come to the spin class?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good luck. All the kids will know once you tell them.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah she did spin and has a bucket of excuses to not make the next 2 spin classes.\\
Tam is going to do some Easter special spin class on Monday of maybe an hour\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did she say if they had a good time on Saturday?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah she said they both enjoyed themselves\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Any comments on me?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And my brother says thank you for the gin\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No comments on you. I can ask next time I see her if you like?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: well not like obviously\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll come up with some subtle way then :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I just thought she might have mentioned something being your friend. My girls would\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: She wasn’t very chatty this morning. I’m sure I will get a review at some point.\\
So your saying you’ve had like a full text summary of what they think of me minutes after meeting?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Even before meeting you myself :winking-face-with-tongue:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not concerning at all but at least they must have said nice things.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well we look out for each other.\\
But yes, very nice things\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think that’s one of differences. Friends don’t really do any checks on who their male friends are dating.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes seems to be the case\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not at the beginning anyway. After a while we may point out things\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I would have thought your female friends would though\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: They ask and show a lot more interest than my male friends.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's why I thought Toria would have debriefed with you :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well she already knows about you. Don’t ask what as I’m not sure what I would have said. Plus she has met you at park run so it wasn’t exactly a first meeting.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: My mum saw one of her friends today who has constant and bad hand arthritic pain. She swears by this CBD oil and says it helps a lot \url{https://paradisecbd.co.uk/product/40-cbd-oil/}\\
They don’t have the 50\% stuff but this 40\% is still really good and apparently the 3 for 2 offer makes it even better value\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you. I'll have a look.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am still here and absolutely pooped. Could we postpone? I just need a shower and quiet time.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: of course we can. It was only if you were up for it.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I thought I was but I'm dead\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't have twilight on Wednesday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What are you thoughts on this week, if you had any. Probably from Friday onwards really. Do you have anything planned Friday?\\
I'd thought we have sort of planned Saturday park run, lunch at the food fair. Then I've guessed you might want a nap but maybe we could try you staying at my place again? Which means dinner as well. If we go to the food fair we might be able to pick up stuff there or sort it out later in the week.\\On that assumption I know we will need to sort fur beast but did you have any interest in helping with an Easter egg hunt \/ lunch at my parents. Only a couple of hours.\\As for next week I have no idea's other than a memory that your pretty booked up.\\So that maybe leaves a question mark around Friday this week for maybe doing stuff.\\Not really thought about it :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm just about to drive off so I'll reply you when I'm home :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: ok, gives you time to think as well\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Other than being dead how are you feeling. Pain and nausea wise compared to "normal"\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okay I'm home :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Long journey\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Right, I don't have anything planned for Friday apart from an easy ish day, maybe gym in the morning. Agi mentioned something about sitting around a fire one of the evenings but not sure when yet.\\
Your Saturday plan sounds good. Will definitely need a nap after the food fair. Can combine it with shower and sorting the furry overlord and then come to you for the evening. We could definitely try for a sleep over (spare room?).\\I can then pop home in the morning and we can go to your parents lunchtime?\\Jo is coming on Tuesday and staying till Thursday I think, then doctors and Mireille on Friday but should be free in the late afternoon\/evening on both\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've had a few big pain moments but the baseline has been normal. Still nauseous but felt a bit hungry around lunch\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok so sounds like there are options for something on Friday and Monday if we wanted. And your busy all mid week next week\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What do you fancy doing Friday?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I didn’t really have any ideas. First priority was trying to work out dinners :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Could I leave it with you to plan a daytime thing?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll have a think. Does that at least mean you’d like to do dinner on Friday?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes we can definitely do dinner. I just thought being bank holiday we might want to take advantage of daylight :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well, that would be nice.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, very accurate\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I thought so :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Shadow definitely followed that timeline. He was a total arsehole from 6 months to 18 months\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You know what, spud was too. Horrendous teenager\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your evening?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: its ok, already played some games before dinner. Which were terrible or at least I was terrible. Just about to have a play on some robot stuff and see what I can do.\\
How is yours?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Mine's been super quiet. Just dinner and TV. Already on my way pottering to bed.\\
I'm looking forward to potentially having actual evenings when I am not brain dead\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: that's probably a good idea. I'll be trying for an early night tonight as well.\\
I think you'll find you have a lot more time and brain power when you start the new job\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I hope I will. This is supremely boring evening even by my standards :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to say night night now.\\
Sleep well and hope you manage an early one.\\Like you loads x x x x x x x x x x x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
\section*{Tuesday $26\textsuperscript{th}$}
Like you loads as well.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00013831-GIF-2024-03-26-06-06-48.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x\\
Definitely not :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\Ready for spin?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not really :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
I hope it’s a better class today but I know it won’t be. Will be better than doing nothing though.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It will be better than nothing and you'll feel good after\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah. Hope your day goes well as well.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you :smiling-face:\\
Are you up to anything exciting today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Crazy day planned :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Got to do some cosmology today. Want to go for a walk and I’m 50\/50 over running later. I can’t really do 4 minutes at the moment and I’ve woken up suprisingly stiff (not in a good way :grinning-face:)\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh wow, don't get too much excitement :winking-face:\\
Yeah, I was thinking about it too but definitely can't do those splits.\\Well hope the spin helped with the stiffness\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: From my mums friend about  the CBD oil\\
I buy their muscle balm too. If she has pain in specific places then it’s a good topical balm to rub on. Xx\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Spin didn’t make it worse. So I’ll take it. Pushed harder today to make the class a bit more worthwhile. Very annoying that there were 10 of us. Which is great but need more people on Mondays class.\\
Managed a quick catchup with Becky. She really doesn’t have a lot of luck. She seems bored with her new boyfriend and he does live far away. She seems very good at going very fast straight away and then gets bored.\\Worse for her is that both of her kids have said they don’t want to live with their dad. She doesn’t have the money to go to court to fight it either. School have said her daughter is a different person on the weeks she stays with dad vs mum. Becky is worried she can’t do much as she was already accused in court the first time round of trying to alienate the children from their dad.\\Seems quite broken to me. If the kids want to and one parent is ok with it I don’t know why it has to cost so much.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Glad spin wasn't too bad.\\
That's such a shitty situation with the kids. However, depending on what age her daughter is, courts do very much take into account the kid's preference. Hope something gets sorted out for her though. Can't be easy\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Daughters 8 and son is 11 or 12.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s the cost of getting to court that is the first issue\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I can imagine\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's a crappy situation all around\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: \url{https://www.reddit.com/r/Fibromyalgia/s/5kNPNu4EOm} and interesting mix of idea’s.\\
WFH comes up a few times.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Friday. 2 thoughts for food. Fried rice or steak?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's a good thread, thank you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oooooh I was literally just thinking about fried rice this morning\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Is fried rice the answer then?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes please :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I've thought of something we could do on Friday :man-facepalming: fix toilets as mine is broken as well now. or Monday\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, yes please to that too. It's doing my head I\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: We can have a fun trip to toolstation then :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aww, you always take to the most romantic places :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I try :grinning-face: it does need to be fixed though\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It does\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your day going?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Day is going. Think i'm going to go for a walk and then lunch. Not really done what I wanted to but I have done stuff that needed doing. So, progress.\\
How are you feeling? How did the kids take the news yesterday that you are leaving. I forgot to ask\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's really mild out here so hopefully you had a nice walk.\\
I'm a bit more nauseous today and that headache is just not going and turning into a migraine.\\Well, like teenagers would. One asked me if I got sacked and second if I was terminal. So there's that\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s a lot more mild than I thought it would be. But the ground isn’t super muddy anymore.\\
Oh, that’s no fun. Is your water consumption down compared to last week? I wonder if the drugs need more hydration.\\That sounds about right for their reactions. Good logic to think that if you’d been fired you’d still be at work.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Was it a nice walk?\\
I have actually been drinking quite a bit but I'm also speaking non stop over 30+ kids and it's so loud everywhere.\\That is also a possibility. Definitely having a bit of dry mouth\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And I need to stop to do a food shop on my way home\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: it was nice enough just a bit colder than I expected. Which hasn't happened for a while. No dogs though :crying-face:\\
Talking non stop all day will not help the headache at all.\\I've got shopping arriving Friday morning if you need \/ want me to add anything.\\Also I ordered what I hope is the bit to fix your toilet. So saves us a trip on Friday and I can just come over and hopefully fix it <This message was edited>\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: At least you missed the rain! Started proper raining here.\\
Thank you. I'm just going to pop to the posh Aldi as got nothing for breakfast etc.\\Thank you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you survive shopping?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup I did.\\
Up to much?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not really just finished dinner. Will try some robot stuff I think.\\
What you planning tonight?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you all alright?\\
Not much tbh. Just shower and maybe a little reading\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, I’m ok. Why?\\
I’m hoping the massage tomorrow does something as I’m very bored of this back pain thing. At least the rain helped justify not running tonight. Also got a real low grade ache from the vasectomy which might be linked to the back now I type it. It’s very odd as it’s doesn’t change if you poke or move anything around.\\That’s more than yesterday at least. More energy tonight compared to yesterday?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You just seem quiet and don't usually leave me on read so was just wondering.\\
Oh I completely forgot it's your massage tomorrow. So it's on the second floor of desbox(next to my Aldi). You can park at either side of it, cash or Ringo. Or there's the carpark next to it. Entrance to the whole thing is on the side and her code for calling is 240 and she'll buzz you in. Staircase is on the left :smiling-face:\\Oh that's really bizarre about the ache. It must be connected to the back. You must have been compensating with muscles on other parts of the body. Hopefully Lyddi sorts you out tomorrow.\\I don't feel more energetic tbh but at least I've done the bins.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sorry, didn’t mean to leave you on read. Didn’t have an immediate reply and was reading some of this weeks chapter.\\
Thanks you.\\I sort of hope it’s connected as it hasn’t been a problem before although it’s not uncommon to get an ache.\\Yay for bins I guess :face-with-tears-of-joy: given it’s the second day is probably a positive that it’s not worse than yesterday\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I didn't think you meant to. That's why I asked - to save my brain for coming up with things :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
How did the cosmology work go?\\Yes, it's  progress I guess. However I still haven't made it into shower\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Glad you haven't been coming up with things.\\
Didn't get anywhere near as much as I would have like to have done but very interesting at least. Starting to go through how the gas out in the universe has all been ionised after we also know that it started off neutral and some stuff on how big the first stars must have been.\\Really clever what can be worked out from light spectrography and the fact that stuff very far away is back in time.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That does sound very interesting! You're very clever :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thanks, I certainly dont feel that way while learning about this stuff.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know what you mean. But just the fact you can understand it is big!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm off to bed.\\
Night night x x x x x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
\section*{Wednesday $27\textsuperscript{th}$}
I'll be on my way there soon as well\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00013880-GIF-2024-03-27-07-11-37.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x\\
It's quite the glorious sunshine outside, still chilly though.\\I've slept some, took ages to fall asleep and woke up a couple of times but not properly.\\What's the plan for today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It does seem nice outside. Will see what the rain did if I go for a walk later.\\
Thanks today. Once I get moving and have breakfast is to try and do a bit of work before I get touched up. I have no idea what that will be like but will find out soon enough.\\Need to go to the shit Lidl after as my food shopping is all over the place.\\Then more work.\\I’m hopefully talking to a friends this evening but not confirmed a time yet.\\You planned anything for after school?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What time are you talking to friends tonight?\\
I thought we said I was popping by after work?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Probably not until after 7:30.\\
I thought so as well but thought that would depend how you feel when you leave work later.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'd like to see you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I like that to. :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Let me know how the massage goes. Be nice to liddy, my life is in her hands :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Will do. Of course I’ll be nice. I’m always nice.\\
Most of the time I’m nice.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sooo?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: She is brilliant. Literally just got home. At the moment I feel a bit beaten up but she is good.\\
Definitely a pulled muscle, so that really good. Will probably go back in a couple of weeks.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: How’s your day going?\\
I should not have shopped before lunch?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I'm so glad you had a good session. She's so lovely isn't she?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, did you buy out Lidl again?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's okay. I've actually been feeling alright. And all my classes so far have been super lovely today\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah she is really nice. Easy to talk to and clearly knows what she is doing.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Didn’t quite buy all of it but nearly :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s a nice change.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: All the kids excited for time off?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh god very much so\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: She really knows her stuff\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah, what did you get?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Bought a donut, obviously. All the yogurt. 3 steaks so that there is either 3 for me :grinning-face: or an option for us to have steak on Sunday \/ Monday and then some chicken as I fancied omelet today over Huel.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, well done!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I need to go back in for my last ever form time\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: My fancy new pants have arrived as well.\\
Good luck, enjoy. Have you prepared parting words of wisdom?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oooh can't wait to see\\
No, but I'm sure I'll think of something\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Choose your hard being a favourite of mine.\\
Comparison is the thief of joy\\Drinking is just stealing joy from tomorrow\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: What was nice with the massage is apparently I have good range of motion.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah nice! Did she just do your back? What wax did you choose?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did back and hamstrings.\\
Didn’t choose any wax. She used whatever. I think because it was more for specific muscle work rather than relaxing.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm really glad you enjoyed it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It certainly was a lot less weird than I feared it might be.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I can see why it helps you and why you like it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Why did you think it was going to be weird?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just wasn’t sure what to expect plus it’s a stranger touching me.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have you not had a massage before?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not really. Maybe 2\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I guess now 3\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aaah okay\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It really makes a difference to me\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've just finished. So will head to you?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: yep, sounds good.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, fully stretched out.\\
Before I saw the pic I thought it was going to be the crochet animal.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was the call?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not had it yet. Just finishing dinner.\\
Submitted my assignment and then cooked.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well done on the assignment\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Enjoy the call. I'm probably going to go bed soonish....if I am released from the meter long furry over lord\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: If you flinch he will run away and then give you the death stare\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I can't do that :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope you had a good time on the call. Just off to bed\\
Night night x x x x x x x x x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Call was fun. Been ages since I spoke to Rich. Had to end because our phones were dying :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x\\
Did you have a good sleep?\\Thank you, can't wait to get it done today!\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think so. The alarm was confusing today though.\\
I bet. Half day today? Or just one lesson less\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Full 4 lessons, just shorter :face-with-rolling-eyes:\\
Hope the spin class isn't too boring\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, that seems more annoying or confusing than just have less lessons. So the whole day is timed differently.\\
They reprogram the bell?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Literally that.\\
First two periods are 50mins, last two are 45mins\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: :man-facepalming: I mean that is obviously the easiest solution. Just not doing the last lesson would have been much harder :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Last time though.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I can't really believe these are my last school holidays :pensive-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Then it will just be normal holidays and you won’t need to use the to get normal stuff done like home improvement, doctors dentist etc.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That could work and is what I was trying to come up with. See through but sealed from dust and fur bag.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll have a look what is out there\\
Enjoy the class!\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: 12th or 13th dinner with Becky?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: April?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, last weekend of Easter half term\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Do we trust the weather and I pre buy the food festival tickets for Saturday (cheaper but have to buy today) or wait and see?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Let's do 12th :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: If you send me the link I'll get them\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: \url{http://www.greatmissendenfoodfestival.co.uk/}\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Works for me\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: School WiFi?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Got them\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No, on internet\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What are you up to today?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just heading back from the gym. After shower breakfast faff about it will be work. Get some cosmology done. Might thrown on some washing. Grand plans of maybe fixing the toilet if cosmology gets too hard and then out this evening.\\
Think walk will be rained off again.\\Any grand plans with your free afternoon?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good luck with the cosmology!\\
I definitely need to go into town after work and then go pick up a parcel from Morrisons. And then will have a slow afternoon :smiling-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: image omitted\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh wow, there nice\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah they are lovely\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I guess an end of term thingy\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No, end of working there thingy. Everyone else left today, I'm the only one coming back\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: ahh, makes sense to do they all at the same time\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But I'm only getting my card in a month :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: its shame really that you find out how apricated you at the end\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you made it to town?\\
I lost all mojo today so decided I had to do something productive. I know, how hard can it be to change the cistern on the toilet. Can only be an hour. 2.5 hours later, sweaty and swearing at everything. I think it is done. But I dont yet trust it to leave the water on\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah, just got back home.\\
Oh lord that sounds complicated. I hope you managed to fix it.\\Btw I've looked at mine and can't see a stopcock there :disappointed-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: When are you going out?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Picking Lester up at 6:30 and then walking in to town\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: it isn't even complicated just a pain. We can check tomorrow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you looking forward?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I always look forward. :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Omg you know what I meant\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: But yes. I haven’t seen Al in a while. So it should be good.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you looking forward to it????\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You just relaxing for the rest of the day?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes pretty much. Even though I'm feeling better, I'm still quite tired from the week.\\
You doing anything before heading out?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s still a long week of 5am starts.\\
Just doing a couple of games with Matt then will get ready. Only got just over an hour really.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It is.\\
Haha, you manage to squeeze games with Matt everywhere :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well he is unemployed\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha true. Any luck with jobs?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: He had a second interview this week and will find out next week.\\
I think he is all over the place in terms of his expectations vs the effort he will actually put in\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah that tends to be a problem when someone well qualified is not getting offers\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think the problem is that Matt thinks he’s more qualified than he is.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aaaaaaah, yeah that might be an issue\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope you have a good time tonight x x ti\\

\section*{Friday $29\textsuperscript{th}$}
Really fun night. Was way too long of a gap for the last time I met up with Al. Strange that we haven’t worked together for over 7 years but still have so much to talk about.\\Just going to grab post drink snacks and then bed.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00014002-GIF-2024-03-29-07-37-14.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x\\
I didn't sleep too well either, kept waking up.\\I think I'm going to have a slow morning today, will go on Sunday.\\Hope you have a good session :smiling-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That no good. So excited to be on holiday :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:.\\
Did you want to miss going to my parents on Sunday? Completely acceptable as I think you’ll see them Monday if we puppy visit.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did you not want to go on Sunday?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That not what I said at all.\\
I’ve made some assumptions.\\You’re staying over Saturday night. So waking up at mine. Clocks change so everything is going to be an hour later than normal and I’ve assumed we’d might have a bit of a slow morning.\\I know you’ll need to go home and see :potato:.\\I don’t have timings from my mum yet but my guess is around 11, which will feel like 10 as they wanted help hiding Easter stuff in the garden. Kids do the hunt and then we have lunch.\\So my assumption was if you were going to the gym it would be in the morning.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well you already said that we were going so I wouldn't want to cancel\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ve only vaguely committed that I’d be going. I haven’t committed both of us going\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Whatever you fancy doing, I'm good with it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What I fancy doing and what I will be doing for Sunday are going to be 2 different things.\\
I fancy a nice chill morning with you with maybe us then doing something but it being Easter throws that out.\\My family cannot do timings of things very far in advance. Which frustrates me no end. Thus no actual timings for anything on Sunday or anything committed. That I can sort either later today or tomorrow.\\So there is nothing I’ve committed us to do on Sunday. If you want to come with me to my parents then great. If you rather go to the gym or something then that’s also great.  It was going to be a topic for later to work out timings etc for the whole weekend and confirm plans.\\The Monday “see puppy” plan is mega vague as well.\\Toria and Dan have bailed on the food festival for tomorrow. They need to do a bunch of shopping for the house and are going to try and hit Wren kitchen, ikea and Costco in the same day.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki we'll talk about it later.\\
I've had to go back to bed for a nap, I am so shattered today.\\What are you up to?\\What time will you be coming here?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did the nap help? Could be the stress release from the week at work.\\
Somehow it’s 12 and I’m not sure how. I need to shower and there are  house jobs that need to be done. I failed at fixing my toilet yesterday so I should have another stab at that.\\Really should work some work but the mojo isn’t there. Will try a couple of pages at least but think the house stuff is currently more important.\\What time would you like? We can at least have a stab at your toilet and either fix it or know to add it to Dave’s list. Can then try and book Dave in.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not really, just feel like I can't get up.\\
We can do my stuff tomorrow or over the weekend - you seem to have a lot on. I could just come over later to see you if that works better for you?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s strange but going back to work will have been a shock to the system and if you didn’t sleep well.\\
I can still come over. Might be better to at least know if I can have a go at it.\\We could switch up the evening if you like and I could bring the food to yours?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki that would be great.\\
I still need to sort the flat out and then shower and do my hair.\\What time is good?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Great as in switch up and do the evening at yours?\\
Not before 4 I would say.\\I could come over check the plumbing stuff and then go home cook and bring it or is that too much faff and I should just bring the food and cook it all yours\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes sorry, to do the evening at mine.\\
Oh we can cook here, would be way too much faff going back and forth\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok, I can probably pre-do some of it. Should I bring my big frying pan?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yes please.\\
I do have a wok if that would do though\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, wok should be better. I’ll bring mine anyway.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you got soy sauce?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. Thank you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think so. Let me know what you'd need and I'll have a look\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I can bring everything else\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Great. It’s only because I think my bottle would leak.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just putting some clothes away then can come over.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Brilliant!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Leaving now\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. See you soon\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Home\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you for coming :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Your welcome. It was fun. Shame could fix the bathroom.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah it will get done. Thank you for trying though\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night x x x x x x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night x x x x x x x\\
Have you pottered?\\I think I just fell asleep on the sofa\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, you need to go to bed!\\
Yes, and I'm all tucked in\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m on my way there now\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope you sleep well x x x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You too\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think I’m going to walk park run today\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you not feeling well?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not super amazing. Headache and quite tight.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You can walk with me :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Is Toria coming?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have no idea. I’m going to guess no but I’ll ask.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m not sure if I should force myself to run it or not\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't force yourself. You can do a run on Tuesday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah and I want to repeat my run every day thing again.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Toria is walking as well.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah brill!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Walk today and when you're better you can start your challenge\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Start is behind the lido e\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Agi was just telling me that the field is apparently really wet an muddy at the fest\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not suprised. We could always go on Monday?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Although it might rain Monday\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No let's go today. The weather is lovely. Just take spare shoes?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, I’ll go in boots and take trainers\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Same :beaming-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: As long as I can get my car out I don’t really mind\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I did think about that\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm ready when you are\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok great. On my way.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: See you in a bit\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm just jumping in the shower and will get bits ready. I was thinking about stopping in Morrisons for some non alc tipple. Do I get anything else?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I don’t think so. We have pudding. Only if you want anything salad related\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I've got some tender stem broccoli :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've found a non alc martini at home.\\
Just leaving\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm home. The fox was sitting in the middle of the road again\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you so much for today and dinner. I'm so sorry I couldn't stay\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Silly fox. Must be last for his feeding.\\
Your welcome. It was nice spending time with you.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I like you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I like you too. Like scary amount\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ve woke up again with this odd headache fog thing. Very strange.\\
I was thinking, always ominous. I know you got really sad and frustrated yesterday and spiralled. I can only imagine the frustration but I was thinking about the start of the year. After you had all the time off from work you were able to do a lot of things that you’re not able to. You had your daily \/ weekly goals thing that you were actually hitting and able to do. Then school kicked back in and broke everything.\\That’s why I think the new job will be really good. You’ll get time back and mental space.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x\\
I couldn't really sleep last night so feeling a bit weird ane hurty still but not horrendous\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no. You're definitely coming down with something. Have you taken anything for the headache?\\
Yes, I did get sad and frustrated last night, sorry.\\I'm really hoping you're right and things will get better\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: “Not horrendous” isn’t the best description of a night sleep. Do you need anything? Other than sleep.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not taken anything. It’s not that bad.\\
You don’t need to be sorry. It’s the normal reaction when you can’t do things you want to do but that is why I have some hope as I have seen what happens to you when you’re not teaching.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: What’s double fristrating is just how long the body takes to adapt to change and improve. Negative things happen in an instant and takes weeks to wear off or fix.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You can gain weight in a day that takes a week to lose.\\
Muscle take forever to put on but the body will eat it in a quick minute if not used.\\Pull something in a second that takes weeks to fix.\\Cally’s adhd meds and your new ones prove the brain take ages to adapt. Makes you feel like shit on tablet one but need 3 weeks of them for the good side to show itself.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, not horrendous is a positive\\
Just need a cuddle :smiling-face-with-open-hands:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well at least get some water into you. But you could take an ibuprofen, you don't have to deal with a low grade headache all day\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've started noticing how bad things have been when looking at it from your point of view. When it was just me I just took it all as given and tried to deal with it, unsuccessfully\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully the meds should now start working properly in the next couple of weeks\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think the brain plays tricks on us. It’s easy to think something hasn’t been happening for so long or that it’s always been a particular way. Outside perspective can be helpful for that.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00014094-GIF-2024-03-31-09-25-14.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I can come with you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Has anyone in your fibro group had similar weirdness with alcohol?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You don’t have to come if your feeling weird\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That not me saying “I don’t want you to come” just if your not feeling good then being around children is 100\% not going to improve that\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'd like to come\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok. I’ll pick you up just after 11:30 then. Will say when I’m leaving\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. Do you guys dress up for Easter? What do I wear?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh good point. You’ll need you bunny costume\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-rolling-eyes::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00014104-GIF-2024-03-31-09-29-03.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: C'mon help me out\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Mine green\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :face-with-tears-of-joy: we just wear clothes\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Like you wore yesterday to the food place\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I mean I won’t wear that but I’ll wear what I had last night\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okay\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't know. Some families go all out with dresses etc\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Do they?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Especially at home. Suits and all\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00014115-GIF-2024-03-31-09-31-05.mp4>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Wouldn’t that be for church?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nah, just for family visits\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah we don’t do that.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: So jeans and jumper are fine?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah that will be fine.\\
We are going to be hunting around the garden\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm not Bridget Jones :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Last chance. Sure you’re coming with me?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes if you want me to\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yes, just checking.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: As I’ve let me mum know. As it probably means she’ll tidy a bit\\
More :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:. I don’t want to get in trouble for not telling her.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: My Mums excited your coming. It already carnage\\
Obviously not, they didn’t go to bed til gone 9, apparently Eleanor fell out of bed and so she went to wake Oliver. He’s very grumpy, 1. Because he’s tired and 2. We’re not doing the Easter egg hunt until lunchtime xx\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: The kids were UP at 6:45 this morning with the time change\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh joy!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh can you bring one of the brownies with you. I feel like I might fancy it with a cuppa in the evening :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep, would you like the other thing as well?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Maybe throw one of them in too :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: On the way\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okie doke\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Home.\\
Hope you have a good nap x x x x\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you for today :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm in bed but suddenly super awake :upside-down-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not sure what I did today but you’re welcome.\\
Of course. So that’s the trick then. Get you undressed and into bed :winking-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah apparently so :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You just being you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I went for a little walk with Katie after a half hour nap and when we got back to my car we noticed this!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: She had one of those car pumps so I got it back up to 30. But will see tomorrow if it was a one off or I need to get a new tyre :face-with-rolling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s a pain. Just have to see what it looks like. Could be a slow puncture, sometimes they can be prepared. Not the faff you need.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How was Katie\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I completely didn't notice it before.. will check tomorrow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: She's good. How's your afternoon been?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Been ok. Just playing game. They have gone from good to terrible. Last one and then hunting for food.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah, I need to have a look at this game of yours.\\
What's for dinner?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: CHEESE and brownie. Plus will find some protein\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: are you having dinner or still feel weird?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah of course, it's Sunday :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I might have a little cereal a bit later on. Still feeling weird\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You know I said earlier that it will be a while before I get my assignment back.\\
Got it back this afternoon.\\A gut punching 59\%.\\Feedback even said that I’ll no doubt be disappointed with that score. I apparently missed a bunch of guidance on how it should be written and have written it in the wrong perspective. Need to go through the full feedback but won’t make much difference.\\A stark contrast to do really well in the cosmology one.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh bubs. I'm sorry. What was this assignment on?\\
Hopefully going through the feedback with fine tooth comb will help you do the next one better\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: This was the exoplanet detection one. Feels like another example of where we are meant to read minds on what approach we should take.\\
I’ll go through it all but double frustration is that this is a one and done assignment. Next one is completely different\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Is it possible that some of you guys might have misunderstood the way they wanted you to do the assignment? What are the other people saying?\\
I know you can't redo it but the feedback and reflections will definitely help you with your next ones.\\I'm always happy to have a look at stuff for you if you'd like me to. If nothing else, teacher training teaches you how to analyse your work in super detail\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: No one else has said anything yet. It was crazy fast to get it back today especially given next week is the break.\\
No doubt if I ask the group this early people will lose their minds if they don’t get their stuff back.\\Thanks, I might take you up on that. I think the last 2 assignments are just questions and answers.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I can imagine they would lose their minds. Maybe wait until like Tuesday\\
Definitely ask me. I am here to help with whatever I can\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh my gawwwd. Baby Lexie :pleading-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How did it all go down with kids?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Seems to have gone down very well. Everyone was very calm.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aw that's good!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: She's so cute\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s how the get you :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha I bet\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I mean Eva is such a good girl\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Eva is a bit of an exception I think but she is very chill.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Was she always chill?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Eva had been but some of the past ones have been less chill. There personally does play a huge part as well as owner.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I can imagine. Bailey is a super chilled dog but he's also a bit older now\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: They definitely chill out as they get older\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was your cheese and brownie dinner?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just about to try out the brownie\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They are so nice\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Could you maybe do 11am for puppy visit?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I absolutely could :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok. Just waiting for confirmation.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oooh exciting\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ve made it to bed now so I’ll wish you good night for a change.\\
Night x x x x x x x x x x\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Me too, just now\\

Took me ages to fall asleep too. Yes, I'm feeling better, I'm going to try to make it to the gym\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: All good for 11. Pick you up 10:50.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: God I hope I'll manage to sort myself out :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You can do it.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: On the way\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hi Paul\\
Don’t know if you and Lucy were joking about petting Lambs but this place is worth a visit. Only at Chalfont and if I remember a decent cafe. A lot cheaper than Dodds  Farm\\Nathan's Farm\\07745 292807\\\url{https://g.co/kgs/e5yC7F4}\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: How was the nap? I've managed to get rid of the headache\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Took me ages to drift off but it was nice.\\
Oh that's good! What have you been up to?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I sat for a bit to drink and clear the headache. Tried to sort toilet but sort of forgot the silicone needs to set so I've only made progress. Just done a couple of games with Matt and now about to cook dinner. Then will do some robot club stuff before our meeting on thursday\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Very productive afternoon!\\
I'm glad the headache shifted.\\What are you making for dinner?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: making pizza. Which is a mistake as I forgot I had sausages in the fridge. So the sausages went in the freezer this morning as last night the pizza dough came out.\\
You up to much this evening?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah yes! I took away your pizza night on Saturday.\\
Well the sausages will be fine in the freezer.\\No not really. Had some pasta for dinner and will faff around with the crochet.\\How about you?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ve got some robot club emails to do and by the time I’ve eaten I think that will be evening done. Trying to get an early night again. Will see how successful that is.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope the admin goes quickly.\\
Do you have any of the melatonin left?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I do, have you run out?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no no. I was just thinking for you to take one to sleep better tonight\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, that makes more sense :face-with-tears-of-joy:. I could try one.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
How was the pizza?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good, as always. I nearly messed it up. Did something different when putting the base on the stone and the whole thing nearly went into a ball mess\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You do need to make it for me soon :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, we can do that.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did you manage to sort all your robot emails out?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No, they need a bit more thought than my brain currently has. I’m going to go to bed instead. Full rock and roll. Think this morning completely wiped me\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You did two big sessions this morning and had no rest before heading out again. It's quite normal that you're knackered\\
What do you need to do for the emails?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: The lack of rest in between makes a big difference. Like my Sundays used to be. After spin and a session the rest of the day was pretty much a write off.\\
I did do some boring stuff like recycling and emptying the dishwasher.\\Just need to review something that’s been sent for Thursdays meeting and formulate a reply about the proposal I started. I’ve found some schematics that might help. Just need to be carful on my wording to make sure it’s clear that I know that I don’t know what I’m talking about but my logic does make sense.\\A few of the people seem to have hyper focused on low level and need to zoom out a bit.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That seems quite complicated. Probably good plan to do it with a clearer mind.\\
Are you in bed yet?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep, in bed. Before 10 again!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah well done!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We're still on the couch\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Is that because it comfy and you don’t want to move?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm just finishing the bear's head :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh well done\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Brilliant, well done.\\
Just arms and legs left?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And ears :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh yes :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: He's still a bit wonky but much better than the last one :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m going to try and go to sleep now so I’ll wish you good night x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: Let’s see what spin is like today.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x\\
How are you feeling today?\\Hope spin is good!\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Broken this morning. Not sure if I’m slowly getting sick or it was just a rough class plus yesterday’s big push.\\
Back seems a bit better though. So that’s good.\\Still slept odd. Think I’m getting hot and it’s waking me up.\\How are you feeling?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's probably a combination of both. You really did loads yesterday.\\
I'm glad the back feels better.\\How about sleeping with the window open? Might cool you down during the night.\\I'm okay. Slept a bit weird again, but I think that's just the usual half term sleep.\\What's your plan for today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Might try window open but that does increase the noise. Think I just need to clean my fan or at least try that first and check when my heating is on as i should be able to turn in down in April!\\
Half term sleep?\\Plan today after I’ve had breakfast and shower is make more progress on cosmology chapter, sort out my robot emails. Might do then first so they are done. Shouldn’t actually take long.\\Silicone should have set so can have another go at fixing the toilet. If it still leaks then it’s onto phase 2 of glue everythey shut.\\If it doesn’t rain go for a walk. Might try breaking in my trail shoes as not really used them yet. Had thought of doing a little run but am currently knackered.\\Got my food stuff arriving this afternoon.\\What are you planning now your plans have changed a bit.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The night noise can't be much different to the noise of the fan, no?\\
I take my heating down to like 15 at night so it's not kicking in really. But it will be open windows soon enough for me.\\I've made an appointment for smart meter :smiling-face:\\Yeah, rubbish sleep until my body adjusts to not being at work.\\You're having a busy busy day. Can't wait to see what the food stuffs look like.\\I'm meeting Becky and the girls for coffee at the walled garden at lunch. I'm going to have breakfast and a slow morning and then clean when I get back. Super rock'n'roll day here\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: The fan noise is consistent and drowns out other noises. Outside could be anything, plus I have a blind and curtains in the way of air flow.\\
Well done on the smart meters.\\Lunch sounds good. Are they not at work either. Everyone a lady of leisure.\\It is first official day of your holiday so you should take it slow.\\Any residual pain from the gum yesterday?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That makes sense.\\
I did buy a fan last year but can't sleep with it. Even though I fall asleep to an audiobook\\They are working, just doing a lunch break catch up :smiling-face:\\Oh god, yes. I am definitely feeling yesterday's gym\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That will be something else you can do with the new job as well then. Lunch with people.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: \url{https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGea7h8Ac/}\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Brilliant :grinning-face:.\\
I think I’m looking after puppy for a day next week.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ooooh, make sure you let me know when :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Looks like Tuesday but not confirmed yet.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Brill. How's work going?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s going. Just took me ages to work out a quite easy calculation :man-facepalming:\\
Just out for a walk then will lunch.\\Have you lunched!?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But you worked it out :smiling-face:\\
Enjoy your walk.\\Not yet, Becky is picking me up in 5\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Enjoy girl lunch.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
It's just a coffee.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I did a hello fresh order for next week - it was 50\% off\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: it can still be enoyed\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh well done. That's shopping sorted then\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I found something to try in your slow cooker \url{https://www.instagram.com/p/C5CA8bcofSY/}\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It was very much enjoyed :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh nice!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well it's only 3(6) meals\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: dinners sorted then\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Meant to ask you over the weekend. Did you want to go to pub in the park? Not even sure there are tickets but I seem to remember you mentioning it a little while ago.\\
Only asking as I have the option to go and see Kate and Rich that weekend.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup.\\
Btw, I'm in Aldi do you need anything?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't worry bubs. The tickets are too expensive for what it is. Go see Kate and Rich if you have the chance :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
(Who's Kate and Rich? :grinning-face-with-sweat:)\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thanks but I think I have everything\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Rich is who I spoke to the other week. Him and Kate live in Wales.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aaah yes! Sorry, fuzzy brain\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah we can do that.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Any of your friends would want to come?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I can ask.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: More the merrier\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You okay? Did you have a good day?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah I’m ok. Uni work was rough but got stuff done.\\
Have eaten my first simmer dinner. Not terrible.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh you didn't say they got here. How's it all looking? What did you have?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: They look ok. I had the burrito but had to use a knife and fork as they put a sauce on the outside.\\
Lots of veg in all of them :crying-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How did it taste? What was the veg tonight?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It tasted really good but did have red onion and sweetcorn.\\
The sweetcorn is maybe acceptable but the onion is my worst.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I can imagine. Both of those are a bit :grimacing-face: for me too. How did you do with it?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just Ate it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well done! Trying new things\/bits you don't like is a massive achievement\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you up to anything tonight?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Probably just some games. See if we can do better than yesterday before the big update tomorrow\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What are you up to?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ears and limbs?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've pottered around doing some chores, not loads. The DOMS are properly catching up with me\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Limbs-arms\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: CBT bath for the DOMS?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I might have to\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Apparently did over 9k kgs yesterday :grinning-face-with-sweat:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Eh?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: OH\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, 9 tons is going to hurt\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did we have a plan for this week?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not yet as the assumption was you wouldn’t be free until Friday.\\
I’m busy Thursday evening. But other than PT and uni free Friday for us to do something\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I know, didn't expect change of plans :grinning-face-with-sweat:\\
I've got London and theatre tomorrow afternoon\/evening.\\And then the two GP appts Friday morning and seeing Mireille early afternoon so definitely up for something Friday evening\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well I might have super excited simmer dinner available for Friday :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: the best a microwave can do.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah, what a treat!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I do have gu pudding as well\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We could go for a walk before\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Or do something\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That would be nice. If it stops raining\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah yes\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I was thinking a lot about you today\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh. Is that a good or a bad thing\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good thing, of course. How could it be bad?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have no idea but the catastrophisIng can be pretty quick.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no, please no catasrophising\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You already said it was good\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Lexie has just learned that she can climb up stairs. Not down, just up.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, aww clever pup\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How are the games going?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Somewhere between not bad and OMG how are we so shit.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well doesn't sound like a too bad of an evening\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It could be a lot better. It’s just painful.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm just trying to be positive and supportive :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I appreciate the support\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm pottering towards the bed\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm glad you find me so sexy\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What time you heading into London tomorrow.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I do! That was just the first sneak gif\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not until 3ish\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Time for a nice slow morning then.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You're having a lay in?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is the plan. Have changed my heating times just in case it was waking me up.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah good. Hopefully that will work\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :crossed-fingers:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Shall we try a sleepover on Friday?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Then parkrun? We can try\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah. I'll be going into London on Sunday again\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Only if you want to\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah I’d like to. Shame we don’t get a proper lie in but would be good to do. I’m up super early Sunday as well.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh what's happening on Sunday?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: F1\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: 6am start\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah of course\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We wouldn't get a lay in until next Wednesday I think\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sounds about right.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well I'm off to bed\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night x x x x x x x x x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night x x x x x x x x x\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x\\
I was up at 4 because the toilet was so loud :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\Ah that's good, nice little lay in.\\What are you up to?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Doh :man-facepalming: I’ll message Dave today and try and get a day sorted for everything to get fixed \/ fitted.\\
After breakfast I’ll be back at work. Actually doing the assignment question but it’s stupid calculus stuff. I think I know what to do but we will see.\\If it stays nice I’ll do a lunch walk. Won’t be doing any games today so maybe try some robot stuff.\\What are you doing before heading into London?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
You can do it! Just take your time and don't rush yourself.\\Not much tbh. I still have to get out of bed. Breakfast, shower, hair, potter around. The usual\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you checked your car tire? Just thought of it before you need it for later\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I did yesterday, haven't gone down. Will check again today\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s good at least. Something to keep a check on. Very weird for a tire to go flat once and then be ok.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know. I also noticed then that there wasn't a cap on the little filling valve thingy (I don't know what it's called)\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The valve.\\
Not a bad idea to buy some valve caps. Just stops them getting dirty which can then make them leak. A missing one on its own won’t let air out as that’s the valves job.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll get some. Are they universal?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am still soooo hurty from the gym\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yes, all the same.\\
Did someone maybe push it a bit too hard?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Maybe\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I was just excited to be back :grinning-face-with-sweat:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: \url{https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGem1RCa7/}\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That one is brilliant. Triangles and only liking 2 people.\\
I would like one.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I love this account. They do a different doggo almost every day :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hope you have a good trip into London and enjoy the show\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm just getting dressed.\\
How's your day been so far?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Day is painful. Its taken forever to do one equation and I was completely blocked for ages. Think I have an approach now but this question is taken forever to try and do and I'm only 50\/50 that my approach is correct. Will see what the final answer comes out like\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sounds really complicated. Push through, I'm sure you get there in the end. I imagine none of these questions are supposed to be easy to do\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I'm sure there not meant to be easy but I'm sure they are meant to be easier than this. My answer is clearly wrong as I've come up with 115 billion years as the answer. Time to start again.\\
I really am starting to wonder if I am smart enough to do this stuff.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You can do it. Just take your time, look over your notes again if need be\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I found a mistake and get a slightly better answer. Still think it wrong based on the follow up question and the marks assigned per question dont line up nicely with the amount of work I have done. I did email my tutor. I might have part a wrong and its a question where each answer carries forward.\\
You made it to the train yet?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well done on finding the mistake. Hopefully your tutor will come back with some useful help. Are the forums saying anything?\\
Yup, just waiting at the train station\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Nothing on the forums. Which isn't a surprise as we cannot talk a lot about the assignments\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah bugger. Maybe looking at it with fresh eyes tomorrow might help?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Maybe. I'll see. Just going to leave it now.\\
Hope you have a good evening\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
What are you getting up to?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I might have fixed the toilet. Now to leave it to see if it leaks before I seal it all back up.\\
Cleaned the kitchen and about to have dinner. Want to see about some robot stuff later\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ooh, exciting. Hope it works\\
What's today's micro magic?\\We're just at Franca manca\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Micro magic? As in dinner.\\
Jerk chicken. Suprisingly good.\\They need eating by Friday so unfortunately it will be our dinner on Friday.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Really what I need are quick to make rice and protein with a sauce type meals plus the veg I can handle. Carrot peas and beans.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just checking with Dave but he might be able to do next Tuesday after 4pm?\\
Or any Saturday from the 20th onward and other Tuesdays.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, yes. I'm glad the two have been good so far. What is on offer for Friday?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We can have a look for those :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Next Tuesday would work. Are you having Lexie?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think so. I can always come over after she gets picked up.\\
Thought sooner is better and while school holiday. Even if it just gets the toilet fixed.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not very high up though. Looks you can see it all. Until everyone gets in front :grinning-face:\\
Enjoy\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Shall I book Dave for Tuesday?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah would love for the toilet to be done. And if he can do the taps and shower even better. Did he mention how much it will be?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes please x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: He didn’t say. I’ll ask again. Going to be within the £200-£300 range I’d guess\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. Thank you :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just at interval :sleeping-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I thought it was going to be a long day for you. Is it good?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm just hoping I'm making the train back. It's really well done. The songs are more modern than the film\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your evening been?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The last train is pretty late, unless they have changed it. Another hour of the show i'd guess?\\
Evenings been ok. Watched some TV and now trying to implement Bluetooth communication with my robot. As you do\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Dave is all set for Tuesday. Might be less than I though. He charges by the hour. Recons maybe £120 but obviously more if it takes longer\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m going to wish you good night x x x x x x x  x x x x\\
Hope the rest of the show was good. Message me when you get home.\\Like you loads x x x x x x x x\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm just out of the theatre. It was really good. Will text when I'm home\\
Night night x x x x x x x\\Like you super loads\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm home safe and sound. Hope you're sleeping well xxx\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x\\
It was, I had to wait at Marylebone for 40mins. Knackered today.\\How did you sleep?\\How was spin?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sleep only ok. Was wide awake 3 minutes before the alarm went off.\\
Spin was rough. Only 3 of us! And zero thought into the class. Mentally painful. Just doing a quick bench session.\\This is why I dislike public transport. Either loads of waiting or you rushing.\\A good nap on the table for today then.\\Did you at least have a good time? What was it like seeing your friend again?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I was up at 4 again too :face-with-rolling-eyes:\\
Oh no, Joseph is really slipping. Did Toria go?\\Yeah I just missed the train before as I walked into the station.\\There's definitely a nap in my future today.\\Yes it was really good. The show was brilliant and seeing my friend was really good as well :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\What are you up to today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: No Toria today. She really hates Joseph’s class and seems to have lost her mojo a bit.\\
Today will be just uni work. Got to make a big dent in chapter 2. Hopefully a walk as well if it is horrid outside. Suspect it’s all mud.\\Got my robot call this evening which should be good. Think I’m going to be coordinating the new robot project. It could be quite big, if I can find the right angle.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm not surprised if he's being such a crap instructor.\\
It looks lovely and sunny outside :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\Oh that's interesting. Who's deciding on who's coordinating the new project?\\Is it the school Collab?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It is nice outside just very wet.\\
The chairman emailed me and asked if I’d do it :face-with-tears-of-joy:.\\I did start it all by sending out a proposal document and it’s what I’ve been trying to build so I have a bit more invested in seeing it happen. Plus I’m not sure anyone else is that keen on paper work.\\Not that I like paper work but that’s the easy bit.\\Yeah it’s for a robot that schools should be interested in. Gives the club a few more routes to get people interested.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that's really cool! Should definitely be a good call tonight then :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hope so. It feels like there is a monetisation option here as well as getting more people involved. Just got to lower the barrier to entry.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: There should be one. But heads up, monetising stuff with schools is hard. If they can try to get it for free they will.\\
But robotics clubs are popular. Especially if there was an option for them in schools with a high pupil premium numbers\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m not expecting millions. Duncan has had success in selling to schools in the past.\\
It more a thought of creating a package people can buy with everything they need.\\Can’t see a school or club buying more than 10 kits a year.\\So not huge numbers\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that would be perfect!\\
You're a clever bunch you robot boys :smiling-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Other than a nap what are you up to today?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to get a pedi. Desperately need it. And will pop to Katie's for a coffee at lunch. And then should probably bring up at least one of the bags of crap from the car and start sorting it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: A nice relaxing day then\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: In parts :grinning-face-with-sweat:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: how was the Pedi and Coffee?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh it was all very nice. Love a nice pedi. And I've just woken up from a nap too.\\
How's your day? How's work?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Feel any better from the nap?\\
Work is hard. Think I found a mistake in the answer to an exercise OR I really don't know what is going on.  Certainly doesn't make it easy to understand the material with mistakes in it.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I'm feeling quite well today except being tired from the late night.\\
God it sounds complicated. You can get through it. Just take your time (I know that's frustrating but it seems this level work really needs much more time than you'd think)\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That's good news at least. Being tired is justified from a late night.\\
That is the paradox of this years work. It needs more time but the brain fails quicker when going through it. So I have to do it in small bursts BUT you dont actually have more time to do the work.\\Any thoughts on timings for tomorrow?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I can imagine. It's all very high level work. And I know it's been really hard too. But you are making progress, it just needs a lot of time dedicated to it.\\
I was thinking 5 ISH? How does that sound?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: *ISH*, so later then :face-with-tears-of-joy:. That sounds like what I expected and works for me. Your out for lunch anyway right?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm seeing Mireille in Marlow at 1.30. not sure whether it will be lunch or just coffee.\\
What's the plan for us for tomorrow?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: ERM,\\
Walk, if its nice.\\Dinner, which will take AGES to cook :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\Then I have some games we haven't tried yet or The gentleman or something else.\\Plus getting you setup in the spare room, assuming the plan to stay over.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That sounds great!\\
I'm really looking forward to spending some quality time with you :winking-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: me too\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What was for dinner tonight?\\
Are you already on your call?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Had the butter chicken for dinner. Lots of green beans in which I do not like. Otherwise it was nice.\\
Call is at 8. Just about to re read the stuff for it\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What carbs are they all coming with?\\
I'm glad you're liking it overall. And you're doing so well with trying all sorts of different veggies. I know it's not easy, I've got my own food things.\\Hope it all goes well.\\I have one more leg and ears to do and then put the bear together\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: The ones for this week are all rice but I've got some that come with potatoes and other options I've immediately dismissed.\\
OH, that great progress on the bear mk2. Finished today?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you going to order for next week?\\
I'm really hoping to. Or maybe tomorrow\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: already ordered for next week. You have to get your next week order in by Tuesday. Which is much further ahead meal planning than I'm used to.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah that's same with hello fresh and gusto.\\
Will you keep with it? Is it still discounted?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: the first 4 week are discounted. Will prob cancel after that if not before. I want to try out some of the slow cooker meals I found\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: they look good\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I can bring the slow cooker tomorrow if you want\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: if you remember. Not urgent\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: If I remember :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Aww, he’s had a busy day.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Calls done and I’m now on bed. Not sure what I’ve signed up for being a coordinator but we will see.\\
Hotels for mega con Manchester are a pain as well. Pick the wrong one and parking is going to be a joke\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Was it a good call?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Pretty good. Like calls at work it’s very easy to go way to deep into the technical too soon but I think we got there\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah that's good.\\
I'm just trying to finish the bear\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Much left?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just needs putting together. Bit wonky but decent\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Nice.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: He’s used to being bed time by now\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Definitely! I'm such a terrible mother :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll wish you good night.\\
Night x x x x x x x x x x\\Good luck with the bear. Looking forward to seeing you tomorrow\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night x x x x x x x x x x\\
\section*{Friday $05\textsuperscript{th}$}
Sleep well.\\Look forward to seeing you too :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Morning x x x x x\\
That looks amazing. Well done.\\You pleased with it?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did Spud have anything thoughts on it or was he still sleep?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x\\
How are you? Are you having a session with Hannah?\\Yeah I'm pleased. For a first one it's decent. Definitely need to improve on the sewing together and stuffing\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nah, he's not interested :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Am now knackered. Off morning where I snoozed for 30 mins by mistake. Was dreaming, which is odd and then immediately forget what the dream is.\\
Good session but was circuits again. Just brutal.\\I thought he might think it’s a new toy for him :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\How are you. Second late night in a row for you.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh well done for getting through it!\\
Are you still feeling like you might be getting ill?\\Yeah I know. I'm just having trouble sleeping this week. Will bring it up with the GP.\\What are you doing today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think the ill has either passed or was just tiredness. It’s also quite possible it the start of hay fever.\\
So you can’t sleep if you don’t have to get up at 5am for your highly stressful job? That doesn’t and does make sense :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\Got a call with my friend this morning. Got to finish off the last 8 pages of my chapter and see if I can answer any of the assignment questions. Might squeeze in some shit games with Matt before our date.\\Are you meant to be in London again on Sunday? Hannah said there are no trains from Wycombe to Marylebone this weekend.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yeah they were saying the pollen count was getting high already.\\
Haha yes. But it kind of always happens over holidays. But it could also be the nes meds.\\Ah nice. Is it the standing appointment friend today?\\Oh crap. Yea, going in on Sunday. Didn't realise that was the case. Will have to look for alternatives\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah this is my standing call with Chris. Been a few weeks since we last spoke.\\
Oh that’s good. Sunday might be ok then.\\If it happens every holiday then unlikely the new meds :man-shrugging:\\Maybe you have too much time to think and your brain is just flat out.\\This does happen every year. I think I’m getting sick and then I remember hay fever. I used to only get it every other year but now it seems to be every year.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah nice! What time is it?\\
Hopefully it will be. Otherwise I will probably need to go to taplow.\\Well it does sometimes. I don't know anymore what is the job and what is my body tbh\\I actually started taking treathay last year and have had a really low hay fever symptoms\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: 11am today.\\
Taplow isn’t too bad if you have to.\\This one sounds like a job thing. If it’s every school holiday. That is the factor. Be interesting to see in a months time though.\\I’ve got a stack of pills somewhere for the hayfever. Need to start today really as they take a week to kick in.\\What time you heading out for lunch \/ coffee\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah brill.\\
By next month the meds should have almost completely leveled out so that will also colour the comparison. As long as it's all better I'm happy\\Yeah I need to pop them in my ever growing collection of pills too.\\Meeting Mireille at 1.30.\\I'm waiting for my first gp app, already 15 mins late :upside-down-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Only 15min :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good luck\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: She's so brilliant. Got another check in booked in for next month\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s good. You might finally be in the system and can keep some momentum.\\
Any outcomes?\\Separate. Assuming it’s not super raining tomorrow and we do park run. What food would you like for the morning? I’ve realised I don’t have much :man-facepalming: but can acquire.\\I just have a protein shake.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully.\\
This was very much a how are the meds working\/do we need to change etc type of appointment.\\I've got the mental health lead at half 11 I think. And then the may one is catch up post my pain clinic appointment\\Ah don't worry. I can bring my porridge and bits.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sounds like progress at least.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes definitely\\
Fingers crossed it all keeps getting better\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is the plan. How has the second one gone?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's not until 11.44\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How was it?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not very helpful tbh.\\
Just got to marlow. how's your day?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s a shame.\\
Days ok. Longer call than I expected with Chris so delayed the day a bit. Good to talk though.\\Enjoy lunch.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Glad you had a good chat\\
I'm just about to head back. I literally have not stopped today\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You having a nap?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't think I'll get a chance now\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Is there any chance we could do the sleepover tomorrow instead of today? I'm just so frazzled. I'm still definitely coming over, but just been thinking about sleeping at home. I know you said you are getting up early for F1, but I wouldn't mind that if you don't?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah we can do that. Much lower risk.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you :red-heart:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: We still doing bingo tomorrow?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes yes :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: any of your friends want to come? Or parents?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Everyone said no. Didn’t ask parents but I can ask them tomorrow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No one wants to hang out with me :loudly-crying-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That wasn’t the reason at all.\\
Some army in country, some said no to bingo\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, okay then\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You still aiming for 5\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: If you still want to go for a walk Lester and Matt and walking to the pub\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You want to go to the pub?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Or we can just do our own walk\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Up to you if you fancied some socialising with people or not\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm really fancying some socialising with you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So just us then? Which is completely fine\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s is an annoyingly long walk\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just us would be lovely\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x x\\
I woke up a couple of times but not like properly so I guess that's better. Cat is sick of my nightly crap, he's still in bed :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\How did you sleep?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Surely if spud was sick of it he’d run off to somewhere else?\\
I slept ok. Feel tired this morning for some reason and I seem to wake up at some point before my alarm go back to sleep and then my alarm gets me in a REM cycle. Think something in the house is waking me up.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nah he's too lazy. He just gives me the side eye.\\
Oh that's no good. Did you have your fan on?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: So he’s just being a normal judgy cat then.\\
The fan is always on. Always.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy: Might be the sound of that. That usually wakes me\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The sound never changes it blocks all the other sounds\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know. But sometimes I can fall asleep to it no problem but it will bring me out in the middle of the night\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is odd. I’d blame the cat :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s how they get you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was coffee?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was good. Took ages to get served and there was free cake.\\
Have you found your stuff at the market?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Imagine everyone went.\\
Are you home now?\\Yeah she was there. I blew in, bought out the bath salts and just walking back to the car.\\When are you going to parentals?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: At my parents. Didn’t go home.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Awwww babyyyyyy\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Say hello from me\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::smiling-face-with-hearts::smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've just woken up thinking about the fact that I still haven't received the new v5 for the car. What shall I do?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: There will be some form on the DVLA website to request a new one\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: So do you think they've sent the paperwork or should I call the garage?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I don’t think there is any point phoning the garage. Just need to deal with DVLA\\
\url{https://www.gov.uk/vehicle-log-book}\#:~:text=You'll\%20usually\%20receive\%20your,25\%20to\%20get\%20a\%20replacement.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah okay. Thank you. I'll do that\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did you have a nice time at parents?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, still here :man-facepalming:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha enjoy! Have you just been chatting?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Always just chatting\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It sounds nice\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s odd. I guess into the next step of whatever that form is\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to try again in 10 but it's so bizarre\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Very odd.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Home yet?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, been home made an hour. Finally showered. Did more washing and sat down.\\
Got that lovely park run headache despite drinking like a fish at my parents.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no! Maybe take a med?\\
But you did well to run it even though it felt hard.\\I'm going to try Jeff next week\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Taken some meds.\\
Glad I did it but definitely the first proper run in a while.\\Oh, nice. I might step it down and go for 2:40-1.\\I once again did the first km way too fast.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah changing the splits might be the way forward.\\
Oh I used to do that so much , always killed me\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm running a bit late. I ate and got nauseous\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok, what time do you think? Still planning to stay over?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Maybe like 15-20mins late. Yes, definitely\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm just getting dressed\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok. See you in a bit.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: On my way x\\

\section*{Sunday $07\textsuperscript{th}$}
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Home?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup, finally :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone: I'm such a Muppet\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Easily done\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Enjoy vroom vroom vroom\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00014567-GIF-2024-04-07-08-03-17.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You all set?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am dressed and crochet bits are packed :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was vroom vroom?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done.\\
Bit of a let down in the end. Was all interesting in the middle and then the end was a bit predictable.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aaah well at least the middle was good\\
What's your plan for today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not sure yet. Probably going to have early lunch. I got some new resin for the printer to try out printing some maze walls for the robot stuff. So I want to get that going to see what its like. Might try and do some other robot stuff as well. No doubt some games as well.\\
Hope the train goes well. How long do you think you will be in London?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sounds like a productive day. What's the new resin like?\\
Omg, the whole station is already shambles. Parked behind it and had to walk aall the way round, and through barriers and security and police just to get on the train. It's going to be carnage later on.\\Not sure. Maybe like 3-4 hours. I guess we'll be limited by the little lady but definitely getting some lunch. Got on the earlier train you suggested this morning\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: The new resin is just white. Hopefully cleaning up the grey stuff isn't that much of an issue. Will find out.\\
OH wow. Add that to the reasons I dislike football.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: In Waterloo. I definitely overdressed, it's really warm on town\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It does seem quite warm today. Always worse in London as well.\\
At least you can take stuff off.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh no not more books :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I didn't buy anything!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But was definitely tempted\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Could always pick one up on the way back so you don’t have to carry all day\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh don't put ideas in my head :face-with-tears-of-joy: I've nowhere to put them. Will do the IKEA order tonight or tomorrow\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Then you’ll have loads of space\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just on my way back to Marylebone. How's your day going?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How was lunch?\\
Day is going ok. I've never actually changed the colour of resin before on my resin printer. It is not as easy as changing filament. What a MESS it makes and only need about 900 bit of kitchen paper. BUT I do seem to be creating some new walls. Good to get it going again.\\Have fallen down a rabbit hole on a possible upgrade for my coffee machine that looks fun but could also be very much over the top. Otherwise not much\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah, you get sucked down the weirdest rabbit holes. What's so fancy about the new coffee machine?\\
Well done on managing to change the resin!\\Lunch was so lovely. I haven't seen Georgie since October half term and she's had tough few months with everything. But the little bub is thriving now and cute as a button. Such a no fuss baby.\\Just waiting for the train to leave. I do have a massive headache so looking forward to home\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Its not even a new coffee machine. It modifying my current to super nerd status. A whole new automated control system to control temperature and pressure while the coffee is being made. Could go full mad and even add an inbuilt scale so it shuts off at the right time. Seems like a cool electronic project to do.\\
That's great you had a good time. It has to be a rough adjustment anyway let alone how extra hard it is when baby arrives early.\\The classic London headache or something else? You could have a nap or at least just sit in some quiet for a while.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh my lord. You're such a nerd :face-with-tears-of-joy: love it.\\
Yeah she's been massively screwed over by the medical staff, like long term effects screwed too. But they are doing better and George is resourceful so she will get through. Loved the bear and blanket :smiling-face:\\I think it's more lack of sleep\/bad shoulder pain headache. I've had it building since this morning. Will take some meds when I'm home and maybe do a half hour nap\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Your just figuring out the nerd stuff now :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Oh, that’s not good. Long term effects for her or the baby. Neither is good obviously.\\Glad the bear and blanket was well received.\\So have we worked out that you cannot sleep in my house then?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no, I've known it all along. You're just showing previously unseen depths :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Well baby is a preemie so there's always going to be that. She was almost 7 weeks early. But more so for Georgie\\I don't know. I'd definitely want to give it another go. Might bring my own pillow :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, I think there are more depth as well. Like your suggestion yesterday about curtains etc. I have already spent more than a few hours looking at ways to automate and build my own system for that. It's on the summer project list.\\
Ahh right. Kate (Wales) was a preemie and had a hole in her heart and some other stuff they had to fix.\\Both Oliver and Eleanor were undercooked but I think that was more due to Vicki's lack of eating.\\We can certainly try again. We might have to draw the line if you bring your own mattress though :face-with-tears-of-joy:. It didn't feel like we were able to take advantage of waking up in the same place\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Indeed, you are very in depth nerd :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Haha well I have already been looking at whether it's possible to get like a firm mattress topper or something :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\No it didn't. But at the same time you had vroom vroom to watch and I wanted to get home because I didn't sleep well. Hopefully next time we'll have a morning together\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you find anything for mattress toppers? The other problem is that my mattress is quite firm compared to hotel ones. They are normally marshmallows\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I just had a quick look to see whether it was even a thing. They are a bit pricey.\\
Oh no, I've slept quite well in places like premier Inn before.\\Just parked up at home and the headache is definitely migraine now :face-with-head-bandage:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Maybe it was a good thing you didn't sleep on my air mattress then.\\
That's no good. Hopefully now you can relax a bit\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's quite possible.\\
I'm going to take some drugs, put away hello fresh and lay down\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have you had hello fresh before?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ive never ordered it but have had a few meals from it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll pass thanks. I’ll stick with simmer for a couple of weeks then try batch cooking again.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki, no worries :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh did you have the scotch eggs?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Literally just finished eating then. They were very good. thank you. :red-heart:\\
How’s the head?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aw I'm glad they were nice!\\
It's not shifting. I've taken meds again and drowning myself in water\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s annoying. Hopefully it will at least clear overnight.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully. Would like to go to the gym in the morning.\\
When are you doing your PT tomorrow?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ve got spin at 7 and then PT at 10:30\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh big day again! Rest in between please :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That all I’ll be doing for the 2 hours :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good. What are you up to tonight?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Played some truly shit games with Matt before I ate. We had absolutely no rhythm at all.\\
Now just watching season 2 of Reacher. Think I’ve got one episode left. Then will see about an early bed.\\Have you been able to do much?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You and Matt really don't have much luck with the games :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
I've been sorting the cupboard under the sink in the kitchen and might have a look into the Monica cupboard :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah we really haven’t been having a lot of luck. I’ve no idea what Matt is thinking sometimes or even if he is thinking and half the time I just do the wrong thing. I either play brilliant or total crap. Nothing in between.\\
Oh wow. Well done. Is that in preparation for Tuesday or you just wanted it done.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ha, but at least you're having fun?or something :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Just wanted it done and feeling a bit better after the nap\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Or something. One of those silly things where it super fun when your doing well but the absolute worst when it going bad.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Make sure you show me when I'm at yours next :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: \url{https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGemsN1s2/}\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m in bed now so I’ll wish you good night x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
Hope you sleep better and the headache goes.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sleep well. Night night x x x x x x x x x x x\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x\\
Unfortunately it hasn't. Woke up at 4 with a splitting migraine so had to get up to have some meds. I'm going to slowly get ready for gym and see if it helps.\\Have fun at spin!\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh I’m sorry. That’s really shit.\\
Gym will kill or cure. Doesn’t the light make it worse?\\You think all from staying at my place?\\Spin was really good. Best turn out for a while. Super high energy AND cake. Not had it yet but will be breakfast after I’ve showered.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Don’t forget if you’re going out to get cash. I do have some if you need for tomorrow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yeah light usually makes it worse, but the meds are starting to work. It's definitely coming from my neck \/ shoulders so I'm thinking it's either pillow or the bed.\\
Oh I'm glad it was a good class. Shame she's not doing more of them at buzz.\\It's so warm in the gym\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going out today and tomorrow lunch so will stop to get some. I need some petrol too\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You in the gym already? It either too warm or too cold in there.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah just wanted to get it done and I've got eyebrows at 12 :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Full on sleepy afternoon then.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha no. I've got to clean the flat and then bookclub\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Didn’t you clean the flat yesterday?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No just the cupboards\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s still cleaning.\\
IKEA as well? Vanguard account.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah but like I need to do the bathroom and hoover.\\
Well I'm doing my life insurance with Katie today so will see if I have brain power for the IKEA\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think Matt is in the gym. But don't think he's noticed me\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: He might be and that doesn’t surprise me at all. He isn’t very observant\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I might have pushed it a tad again :grimacing-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’d already assumed that you would\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Am I that predictable?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Somewhat\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy: and I'm here thinking I'm all mysterious\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It seems a bit of a circular pattern. You don’t go to the gym when you feel bad. Then you feel ok enough to go the gym. By this point you haven’t been to the gym as often as you would have liked so you mega push the gym.\\
Then because you mega pushed at the gym your body hurts you 3x more than it should. So then you can’t go to the gym as often as you like because you mega pushed it last time and now hurt too much.\\<sarcasm>Oh yeah. Your super mysterious <\/sarcasm>\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't be mean to me :disappointed-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How am I being mean?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m not trying to be mean\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m just good at pattern recognition\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But you don't need to call me out like that :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I wore shorts for the first time and I am soooo pale :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Pale or just white\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Pale\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Erm, I think I am.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Meant to that is\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah I messed that up.\\
I think I am meant to call you out on stuff.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you???\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you not just supposed to indulge my fantasy that my body is working properly?:face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think there is some sort of balance that has to be found\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah, yes please :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How was eyebrows and how you feeling?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Painful as always :face-with-tears-of-joy: just got back from Katie's.\\
Migraine still there, might have a little lay down .\\How was your session?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Definitely have a lie down. Have you tried any electrolytes? Just to see if they help at all.\\
Session was good. Had to de load on a couple of things which was a bit of a pain. Think a few short night of stacked sleep haven’t helped.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've had some yesterday and I'm just making up a drink now too.\\
Good you had a good session. Why are you deloading?\\Did you not sleep well again last night?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just had to de-load as I couldn’t finish out the set. Just didn’t sleep for very long last night. All my own fault and it’s just stacked since Thursday.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll blame the back a bit as well but that is a huge amount better the last couple of days.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah okay.\\
Did you stay up late? Hopefully you can have a early and good night tonight.\\What are you up to today?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am really glad the back is better\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: <attached: 00014669-Lydia Casadei MT.vcf>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Later than I should have.\\
Just about to shower, again,  then a little bit of admin and got a chapter to finish. Got a tutorial today at 6pm. Then will try again at some games :man-facepalming:\\Are you going out for book club or is it remote?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good, productive afternoon.\\
Book club got cancelled. Some people had some life stuff to deal with so I'll have a lay down and then deal with the flat\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s a shame, will the book get covered in the next one?\\
When’s your pain clinic appointment? Just so I can add to my calendar\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Probably we'll just move onto the next one.\\
It's Thursday 9th may at 8.30 in amersham. I'm still waiting for the letter :face-with-rolling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: The guy running the tutorial is the lip smacker :man-facepalming::man-facepalming::man-facepalming:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh nooooooooo :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was the tutorial in the end?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was fine. A good recap but nothing new. He’s a slide reader as well. Will be useful for revision and a couple of good diagrams not in the book.\\
What have you been up to with no book club.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've pottered around making\/having dinner and then cleaning. Just sitting down to sort at least some of the stuff I brought back from school. Have you had dinner yet?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I had dinner before the tutorial. It had lots of green in it but was nice.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you get hello fresh?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh what did you have?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes. Had the prawn risotto tonight\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m not even sure what I had. Some turkey sausage pasta spinach thingy\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: From simmer?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What do you have for this week?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Something similar to Fridays one and burrito. I doubled each this week so only 3 different meals.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah cool\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Playing games already?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep and they are already going wrong :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
You two..\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: We did just have a great game and won. Now we are straight back to the blender of being shit\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: We spend more time loading into the game than playing :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha well done on the win\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: OMG\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've sorted and packed it all up!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done. I’ve just got into bed.\\
Mixed games. We did win another one in a ridiculous way due to everyone else panicking but a lot of truely terrible ones.\\Doesn’t make sense that we either win or come almost last.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well done I guess :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\

Did you sleep better?\\How was spin?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Didn’t sleep great but that because I got up.\\
Spin was terrible. Sound system didn’t work for half class and just drawn out.\\How are you feeling today?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no. That sounds like a horrendously rubbish class.\\
When's Lexie getting to you?\\Better now but again woke up with a splitting migraine at like 5 and had to take meds.\\What's your plan for today? (Except playing with the pup)\\I'm going for a walk with Agi at 12 so could stop by on my way back ?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Dog is already here.\\
No idea on a plan. Rain doesn’t help.\\Yes on the time. Might be hard for me to use phone while she is awake\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Heeey baby girl :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: She's got a little collar and all!\\
Are you working today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I will try\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good luck :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thanks\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s asleep!\\
Possible rough plan for Friday. Take away at Becky’s place and then walk to her local pub.\\Chinese or Indian are lane end choices or we could pick something up on the way.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Woo hoo, that was quick.\\
Yeah that sounds good :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It won’t last. Just trying to keep quite :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'd nap with her :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Awwwwwwwwwww\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't you dare move!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m trying :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: She has proper crashed. Meeting Matt must have been very stressful\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh did he pop around?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, I told him I had a puppy\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, that works on everyone\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep, much easier to get people round with the promise of a puppy\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: At least it’s stopped raining for your walk.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I mean I'd come round even if you didn't have her. BUT....\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sure sure :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I would!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What time is Dave coming?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know. But the puppy helps.\\
He said just after 4pm\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Will you pop round?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I was going to once the puppy is collected. Which should be before 5\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Brill. Is he just doing the toilet or the other bits too?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yes, plan is all of it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ooooooh\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’d probably ask him to do the toilet first\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Will do\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Left leg has gone numb\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's the price you pay\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No pressure but what time do you think you’ll get to mine?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We're still walking so maybe another 15-2mins before I leave Agi's\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Does that work?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah that works. I’m not going anywhere :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm bringing bread and butter pudding apparently\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just leaving Agi's\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: \url{https://www.tickettailor.com/events/stokenchurchdogrescue/1117071}\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Done\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yay!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Made the mistake of phoning mum. On my way now\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha. No worries\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: See you in a bit\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well dinner took bloody forever :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: what did you have?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: They do take a while to cook. Was it good?\\
I had what we had on Friday.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It was actually really good.\\
Oh nice, that was yum. Playing games tonight?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah playing some games. I’m really starting to question why. I really really like this game but holy shit have I got crap at playing it.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: We need to find a third player who isn’t shit that we can okay with\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh nooo :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:. You need practice I guess\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You should let me have a go\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It seems that practice isn’t helping :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
If you get a console Xbox one or ps5 you can play or a gaming pc.\\I’ll show you a video next time so you can see what you’d be signing up for.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I don't think I'd be able to be buying a ps5 anytime soon :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Will have to get JJ to get you one so you can work from home :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahahah. Sure\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I hope the games were half decent today.\\
I've pottered all the way to bed now. It's so beautifully quiet without the constant running water :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\Night night x x x x x x x x x x x\\Enjoy your lay in tomorrow :red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: They were half decent.

Oh I'm glad you had a nice lay in!\\Walk was lovely, it was crisp and sunny. Perfect.:smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\I've had breakfast and will have a little nap :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\What are you up to today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, so I’m getting up as you’re going back to sleep.\\
Today is mainly uni work. Will go for a walk at lunch and I have a hacker group meeting tonight I’ll go to. Plus need to pick up the car.\\What are you doing after the nap?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes but I've been up since 5 :upside-down-face:\\
Oh what's the hacker group?\\I've done the IKEA order before the walk so will be here on Sunday. I don't have much planned apart from the bookclub tonight. Will potter no doubt :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s that nerd group I’ve been to a couple of times. Duncan goes to it. Will make me to do some robot stuff.\\
Oh that is early!\\Well done on the IKEA stuff. A bit of building to be done then.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aaah cool.\\
I know. And for that reason I had a massive nap, but actually feel good for it for a change\\Yup, yup :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: hope uni work is going well\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Glad the nap has worked out well. Just managed to time my walk to miss the rain because of course it’s raining\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nice!\\
I literally walked into town as it started raining :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: For shopping?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Went to meet Laura for a quick coffee. But now I'm here I might pop and buy a new smaller belt :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, good plan.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've got two belts :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Are you at home for Dave to do your sink?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sink all done. It was £50\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh good.\\
Car collected and fuelled.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Brill! Thank you\\
When is your hacker group? Is it online or in person?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Starts at 7:30 up near TGI in Wycombe. It’s like a village hall next to the badminton place.\\
Just having food and then will get my stuff ready.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah cool!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm zooming with the bookclub so no need to leave now :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
What's the plan for tomorrow?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s easier.\\
Have you got a bag of drugs prepared for tomorrow?\\My thought are I’ll set my alarm for 5:50. Get up and try to be at yours for 6:30.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't yet but I will put stuff together. I'll take my morning ones before we leave.\\
Shall I make us travel coffee?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That would be good :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. I'll see if I have any snacks\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was nerdy group?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm off to bed now. Hope you're ok.\\

Really enjoyed today and it was really fun watching you have fun. I was checking you out quite a bit while you were watching the animals. You looked really pretty today.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, that's absolutely reasonable thing to do. Now I wish I did the same :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
I have such a wonderful, brilliant day today. Thank you:red-heart:\\And thanks for checking me out :winking-face: glad you like what you see\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: 115 messages :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: nearly vibrated onto the floor.\\

I don’t think my hair is that grey until I see a photo\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Your hair is salt \& pepper :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\

I've slept through the night but was up early. I haven't gotten out of bed yet so not sure of the state of things :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\How are you feeling? Do you have Hannah today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s good that you’ve slept through at least.\\
Just got back from Hannah. Brutal. Thought I was going to throw up at one point and have now just kicked the bed and then walked into a door :man-facepalming: a good setup for the day.\\Got a bit of brain fog or mild headache from all the travel yesterday but otherwise all good.\\How are you now you’ve moved around? What are your plans now you’re not going to school?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh well done for smashing the session. I bet it was so hard after the big day yesterday.\\
Hope you get at least an hour to relax before you do anything. Have loads of water today, we didn't get much in yesterday between the two of us.\\I'm actually good. I am fatigued a bit but surprisingly very little extra pain.\\I've just done the call with J\&J so that's all done now. Will have a little snooze if I can and then popping over to see Katie at 2. And a whole load of pottering.\\What's your plan for today?\\When are we heading to Becky's? Shall I drive?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: How did the call go with JJ?\\
I’ve got shopping arriving soon, my call with Chris, got to take the car back and try and do some work.\\As for tonight I think we’ll be leaving about 7 so didn’t know if you wanted to come here first for a while or just pick me up? Driving would be good.\\Glad there isn’t a lot of pain.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh it was super quick and was lovely. Just to check I look like my home office pic :face-with-tears-of-joy: she also said she only started in January and the role has definitely exceeded her expectations which was nice to hear.\\
Busy day! Shall I come around 6?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Aww, yes 6pm works.\\
Glad the call was quick. I’d thought it would be.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you go back to bed after the call?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, yes I did :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Still aiming for 6?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The children where at my parents :man-facepalming: so loud\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ish. I will hopefully leave here at 6. Got back from Katie's a bit later than expected\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh nooo. You're having a lot of children filled days this week\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, it’s a lot of children exposure this week.\\
Did see the puppy again.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well at least that :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: h\\
What did your dad say about the penguin?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: The penguin was well received. Bit of luck in buying the penguin and me making sure I refilled their car as my dad washed my car.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aw so lovely of him\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just leaving\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope parkrun goes well!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Went pretty well. Did 2-2. Which is quite good. Need to push it more in the run phase.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How was the gym?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh well done! What was your time?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It was good. I'm absolutely soaked\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Spicy :hot-pepper:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No idea. 47mins or something but did get Toria to run all of the run bit.\\

Are you going for coffee?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: No coffee, just got home. So I have half a chance of getting something done today.\\

I'll bring them tonight... If I don't get too tempted :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, I’m assuming you’ve bought enough so you could eat them all\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've bought one each and then one banana one for me :winking-face-with-tongue:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Guessing you’ve made it back home now?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes when I texted you and then pottered and went for a nap where I over slept my alarm :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: whoops, how are you feeling after the nap?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't know what happened here. Don't even remember switching the alarm off or anything :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone: really did not plan on this\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to take a shower and sort myself out to come over\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: sounds good. Let me know when you are on your way\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll have to pop into Morrisons on the way to pick up naans etc. you have rice?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: yeah I have rice\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm proper peed off with myself for losing an hour and half :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone::woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: do you feel better for it? It is the hour and a half you lost last night\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't feel horrendous but I had plans :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: oh, what plans?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Cleaning and sorting stuff :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your day been?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: the day has somehow been fast. Most productive thing I have done so far is clean my coffee machine. Currently banging my head against a wall trying to figure out how I can get a stupid number printed on screen to a lower precision.\\
I've had to write code to try and figure out how they got an answer to an exersice\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh wow, that's definitely a day.\\
Did the code work?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: it seems to and I get the answer in the book. I see where I went wrong. They have clearly used code to work out the book. Id just like to get the answser printed nicer. I dont need 6397394817947.437 as the answer\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: and I found another error in the book around exersices\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that's not good\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: that's why I've had to write code to see if I was wrong or the book was wrong and it turns out it was both\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah well done!\\
I remember trying to figure out the number thing in python but it was with decimals\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You're so clever :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've come on :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone::loudly-crying-face::loudly-crying-face::loudly-crying-face::loudly-crying-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: sounds about right\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What do you mean?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: its add to the comedy of errors for your day with you extra long nap and it has been about a month. The pill doesn't seem to be doing a very good job of stopping them.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And explains why I was such a horndog yesterday.\\
Yeah I don't know what's happening there tbh. I'm going to take a pill break to reset\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Any preference for sides for dinner?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What options are there?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm guessing naan, poppadoms, onion bhajis, samosas?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to feed the beast and then head to the shop\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: not onion bhajis :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: samosas could be good if they have some meat in and naan and poppadoms\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. I'll pick up we bits. And we have pudding. You've got the chickpeas?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I've got chickpeas and rice.\\
You've also got the box mix packet thing?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: the things from the food fair\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: or thing\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: yea\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: yeah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I didn't realise :face-with-tears-of-joy: I've already packed it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: you kept that a secret\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I didn't\\
I literally tried to get into your pants :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: when?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm the kitchen\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: well that does somewhat explain the weird interaction we had in the kitchen but if I had 100 guesses none of them would have been that was what you were trying to do\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahahaha. I'm so mysterious\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And what was so weird about it? :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: more confusing than mysterious.\\
You asked about what pants I was wearing, which were just by old ones as I really didn't think anyone would see them. You said something I didn't quite catch all of about me cockblocking myself and then you told me not to touch you when we were on the sofa.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh god. I was just joking on the sofa :grimacing-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I always want you to touch me\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just heading to the shop and then to you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: ok\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: its pretty hardwired in that if someone says "stop" or "dont touch me" then I'm going to stop.\\
I have no idea how men could actually do any CNC stuff.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know and it's a good thing. I probably should have said I was joking.\\
I don't know. I guess it's a kink like any others\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I can see why women would or could like it but for a guy to do it goes against everything we are told is ok.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Some men just want to do it to women and CNC provides "legal" way :woman-shrugging-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just leaving Morrisons\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm home!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done.\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Very much so. I've done a hair mask and will potter around.\\
I've pulled the couch out and laid the big bits along that wall for the moment, they are very heavy.\\Oh. You've had quite a few headaches recently. I wonder wether they are water\/stress\/weather related. Have you taken anything?\\I think I've had too many good days in a row and woke up to being really fatigued and in pain :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done for getting it all moved.\\
I suspect this is a water and or weather headache. Probably didn’t drink enough yesterday and the hayfever is kicking in.\\Taken all my hayfever stuff but no headache pills. Not that bad.\\Oh that’s no good. You should be allowed to have more than a couple of good days before being punished for it. Is this just the gym catching up with you?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I need to get you one of those bottles with the time marked on them :beaming-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
Hopefully it passes soon.\\It might just be a combination. My left arm was already hurting yesterday so I kind of thought it was coming, and the period won't help either. I'm going to take my meds and take it easy\\Apart from the lawn, what are you up to?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think I have a time marked one. I’ll just notice how much I should have drunk :grinning-face:\\
Good plan for the day. Do you have school stuff to sort as well?\\Lawn, food, games, maybe work or robot, food.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah. I'll just have to send you a voice note every hour to ask if you drank :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Yeah I do. I now understand why it's good to do a job switchover at Easter. I've got very little motivation for the next two weeks\\Sounds like a good Sunday :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think it’s just difficult to keep motivation when you’re leaving a job. Especially when you’ve had a break.\\
You’ve done it to help the kids with their exams. So that’s the only thing to focus on.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know and it will be all fine. Just having the Sunday scaries\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Scared of what?\\
It’s not like they can fire you :face-with-tears-of-joy: not the correct attitude but the truth.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's a very common term used to describe the feeling you get on Sundays when you're not super keen on the job on Monday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think that why people hate Monday’s. They don’t hate Monday they hate their job. If you started work on Tuesday you’d just hate Tuesdays\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was lawn mowing and Sunday lunching?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I forget how heavy my lawn mower is but got it done. Have filled the green bin. So that good. Would really like the garden to be nicer and not have  walls walling apart.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How’s your day going\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh well done for getting it done!\\
We can definitely get a start on the garden over the weekends :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: and hopefully the man will come back to you about the brickwork\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Day's been fine. Slowly pottering around clearing, cleaning, throwing bits out.\\
Made the HF pasta for lunch and it was really nice\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: found them\\
\url{https://www.themightyspice.co/}\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh amazing! How?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How did I find it? I use the google on the big computer\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What did you search for?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: theponopeople curry UK\\
Its the 4th link on google\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ooooh\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well done!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What have you been up to?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I had watched a bit of TV, just finished playing some games. I set the printers off to do stuff. I found an analog 7 segment display that could be used as a cool clock. So printing that out to see what its like and running a test on the resin one. Sorted out my Simmer order and will cancel after this week.\\
Now just checking the printer and will get food.\\Are you all set for tomorrow? Done much else?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh wow. You've had a busy day!\\
How does a 7 segment display look?\\What are you having for next week?\\I don't know if I'm set per se. I've pretty much done everything but school stuff :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: cleaned, sorted more stuff, washed my hair, cooked, eaten, repotted plants, laundry. Everything very slowly\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You’ve had a busy day as well then.\\
\url{https://www.instagram.com/reel/C5pRemVLhmv/?igsh=MWpzcmV5MGFhMmtnbA==}\\Not sure what I’ve ordered for this week. Will find out tomorrow. I keep trying to find their least vegetable stuff.\\Given that curry mix is £3 online I’ll be switching to that and the slow cook meals I want to try.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That is so cool!\\
Yeah it's all a very good price and there's discount for bulk orders too. I really enjoyed it yesterday\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll get the slow cooker to you this week so you can start cooking up a storm\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you okay?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah I’m ok. Why? Just eating dinner.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just getting ready  to go get  my cakes\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just checking. You know how I mentioned I'm sometimes not sure when left on read\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh let me know what you think of the meter one.\\
I had the swirly one after lunch today\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It wasn’t on purpose. No obvious or immediate question and I read it just as I got to faff with printers and start food.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's perfectly okay. I didn't mean it in a negative way. I just wanted to check <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know. I was just explaining.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
How's the cake?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just getting them now. I was finishing my port first.\\
Because I’m fancy.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well you are very faancy.\\
I always wanted to try port. Is it nice?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've set my alarm for 5am :nauseated-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I really like port. It’s just like fancy red wine. Stronger. I normally get a couple of bottle at Christmas. It’s also very much expected that you don’t drink the whole bottle or have too much. So it’s much better and easier to have a small glass.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :face-vomiting: :face-vomiting::face-vomiting::face-vomiting::face-vomiting::face-vomiting::face-vomiting::face-vomiting::face-vomiting::face-vomiting:\\
12 days and counting. Waking up is going to be harder than the teaching\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Does sound nice. Glad you enjoyed it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes it will. I'll get through it.\\
I'm going to read a little and then turn in.\\Hope you sleep better tonight. Night night x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You to.\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x\\
Just having my breakfast but it was definitely a struggle waking up :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\How are you feeling? Did you sleep better?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Feeling a bit weird this morning. Was awake before my alarm went off and just kept drifting and stomach is all growling. My own fault. Dinner was later than I wanted for some reason.\\
How the pain today compared to yesterday?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Feeling weird how? Just the stomach or something else?\\
Pain's pretty much the same today. Let's see how it gets through the day\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just a bit off. Not quite a headache plus the stomach. Probably still the hayfever kicking in.\\
Oh that’s a pain. Is today your short Monday or is that next week?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully it gets better during the day.\\
It is but I'll be staying to sort things out and intervention session if anyone turns up\\Have fun at spin. Hope it's good!\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: We will see. Spin was brilliant. Pretty much a full class which I haven’t seen since the gym opened. Absolutely knackered now. Time for a bit of breakfast and a sit down before Hannah at 10:30.\\
Hope school goes well.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh great! Glad it was a good class. Sets you up for the week.\\
What's your plan for the afternoon?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Simple plan today. Work. Want to finish my assignment question and get setup for the python work this week so I can do that tomorrow. Need to check on any tutorials as well.\\
Hopefully tomorrow and Wednesday will be the python work and the associated assignments question so I can finish the assignment this week. Then I can switch back to astrophysics stuff. We will see.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm sending you all the productivity thoughts x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thank you.\\
How’s the day going?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's alright. Bit of a shambles with scheduling as per but done with teaching for today so just working on sorting stuff.\\
How's the work?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: How’s has scheduling gone wrong?\\
Not done any work yet. Just got back from PT. Will have lunch then start.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I wasn't supposed to have form anymore but they buggered it so had to sort it.\\
How was your session?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not really a surprise on the mess up then.\\
Session was really good. Arms are dead.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not really a surprise, no.\\
Well done! :flexed-biceps:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I got an email for j\&j just to keep me updated on what's going on\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good that they are updating you. Couple of years to look at it at least. Will be interesting to see what the parking is like as that part of Maidenhead is a real pain.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, it's not something to worry about immediately.\\
I'm guessing if they will do a complex like here they might have their own parking. Hopefully\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You would hope. You have to assume someone has checked that the train from Wycombe doesn’t go to Maidenhead\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha, you'd think so. I'm sure I'll find out more when I start\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's boot :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: fixed it?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup.\\
Sorry I bugged you :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You didn't bug me\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's the work gone?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I want to smash something!\\
I've spent over 2.5 hours on a 4 mark question that should give me the same answer as I got on Part A. The best I can get is an answer that is out by a factor of 2. Which could be right but I think I've done something completely wrong on either part A or B or both. For Part C of the question I cannot even work out what equation I am meant to be using to even start the question. I can work out a couple of parts to it but no where near getting any sort of correct answer.\\Going to get dinner instead.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that sounds frustrating, I'm sorry you're having a shit time with it.\\
What can I do to help?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thank you but I don’t think there is anything you can do.\\
At the moment I’m just getting angry at myself. Feels like everything I try and do I’m either making stupid silly mistakes, fundamental don’t know how to do it or I can’t even figure out how to figure stuff out.\\How did your day turn out?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think you might be putting too much pressure on yourself. I've noticed you tend to feel like you have to get it done perfectly in a tight time frame (I know you have deadlines and completely understand that you are under time pressure). And I get this is frustrating, I'd feel the same. But at the same time this is really high level work and you are learning how to do it, so you won't be able to get it right the first, or maybe even the third time. Take a break and try to do something that will completely switch your brain into a different place.\\
It's quite pleasant outside, maybe a walk after dinner?\\Could you speak to your tutor to talk about how you could approach things differently? They might be able to offer you some hints and tips or some extra reading (that's what I'd do as a tutor and that's what mine did when I struggled with some bits at uni). They are there to help you, especially as you don't get f2f time with them to ask questions and clarifications.\\I hope this doesn't come across in any kind of way but caring and trying to be helpful. But please tell me if it isn't :red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thank you.\\
I can ask my tutor. Need to think about how to ask the question as I’m sure the bit I’m missing is the actual answer which he is not going to give me for obvious reasons. I have no idea when I might get a reply but I can switch to the next question.\\I do put time pressures on myself. Mainly as I need them to get stuff done but also because the deadlines are unmovable and after 3-4 hours of doing the work my brain is done.\\I’ll start again tomorrow.\\Need some of the emotion to burn off as well as I’ve proper spiralled.\\I know hard things are hard to do. Which is why people avoid them. Just be nice to get a few more wins.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know bubs. I absolutely get the frustration.\\
I really wish there was something I could do to help you.\\Try explaining where you are struggling. Maybe ask if there are other materials that could help you understand the 'how' a little more.\\Your feelings here are very valid - just let them all out and go through them as you need to.\\Would it be at all helpful if I sat with you and you explained to me the questions and workings through as if I'm 5 (because on this topic I understand as much as a 5 year old)? Verbalising the thinking process might help?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m really not sure there is anything you can do to help.\\
I will try “talking to the duck” to see if that helps. I do try and think out loud on some of these problems but will give it another go.\\I am also well aware these are problems of my own making and not real ones at that.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What is talking to the duck?\\
They are real problems. Please don't minimise your experience.\\I'm here for you no matter how big or small or of perceived importance anything is, I'm here\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: \url{https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber-duck-debugging}\\
This is the main thing I learnt at Uni.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aaaaah! I get it now :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I can be a duck :duck:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, if you weren’t at work then I would take you up on it.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, did you see the email about Wednesday. Do we need to do something to make sure we are on the right table?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I saw it come through but didn't read it. I'll ask Agi\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sandra sorted our table so no need to do anything\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh nice\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What did you have for dinner?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not sure what they called it but it was chicken rice peas and veg I picked out. Was pretty good.\\
You still got HF\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes I had yesterday's pasta for dinner and have new ones for this week but might see if I'll keep it longer. Honestly, I've only bought fruit\/veg and milk\/bread these last two weeks\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s good at least.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also, what veg did you pick out? :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was cucumber and big pepper slices\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yeah, absolutely the right choice\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How are you feeling?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok. Various levels of annoyed and fucked off.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: We have just done the unthinkable and won 2 games in a row.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh my god :astonished-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Feel them all and then let them go\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm sending you the biggest cuddle imaginable\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am really looking forward to not having to go to bed at 9pm.\\
Hope you won some more games.\\Night night. Sleep well x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x :red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That will be nice.\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x\\
I'm alright, same as yesterday.\\You can do it! Spin might help you out of the funk. What else do you have planned for today?maybe a walk?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, that’s a pain. About the pain. Is that because of the gym, period or just because?\\
Maybe, we will see. Just hoping for it to be better than last weeks class of shit.\\Obviously work today. Might just write down what I know and move on. Will go for a walk at lunch and am meant to be running with Toria this evening.\\Are you doing anything this evening? Book club?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think it's just a combination of things.\\
Hopefully it will be better.\\That might be good. Maybe an email to your tutor?\\Oh cool. Where are you running?\\No I don't have any plans today\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Cool double rainbow.\\
Spin was technically better than last week but still the wrong sort of pain. More people though.\\Once I’ve got it written down and had a good talk with the duck I’ll see what I can email my tutor with.\\We should be running round the rye. Her parents live behind it. You could join us if you like? (I’d have to ask first) think we are running at 5\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Stupid question. Why do you get up at 5 if you don’t leave the house until 6:50?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You'd have to ask first ?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Check with Toria if she’d mind you running. I’m sure she wouldn’t but best to ask than assume\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I get up up about 5.20, then coffee, then bathroom, then washing, then face, then dress, then breakfast, then potter, then leaving\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s why I don’t coffee in the morning. Adds the time.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Do you want to run with us?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well I don't have the luxury of having coffee after\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm not sure what time I'll be back\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Very true. 11 more days left.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Happy 5 months x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You beat me to it. I just remembered in the shower.\\
Happy 5 months x x x x x :red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think I worked out at least part of my assignment. After some head banging and a few wrong rabbit holes I noticed something on a table in the book. The math seems to work, so will run with it.\\
Still have no idea why my answers from A and B don’t line up but I’m pretty sure the approach is right.\\How’s the day been for you?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That sounds good\\
Well done!\\It's been pretty full on. Just about finishing\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's the rest of the day been?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Rest of the day hasn't been much. I went for a walk and got caught in the HAIL!, its April :man-facepalming:. Was good to get out.\\
Got all setup to do this week python work but brain is pretty much gone. Only got a few minutes until I'll get ready and meet Toria for the run.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah it's been weird weather here all day too.\\
Enjoy the run\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Whose cat is that?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Michelle's\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was run?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Run was good just on way back now. We doubled the week 3 of couch to 5k. Just under 4k but lots of walking. Good to get something done.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well done. Do you have a tutorial today?\\
I'm just about to go back home\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not today. I think I have one on Thursday but need to double check.\\
Just got home and “cooking” my jerk chicken.\\Any big plans for the evening?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh have you had that before? Is it nice?\\
No big plans. I'm thoroughly shattered. Took all of two days for me to start dropping again. Will make some food, shower and bed.\\How about you?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah I’ve had it before. It is good just not a lot of it.\\
The early mornings can’t help. Sounds like a good plan.\\Tomorrow could be a long day for you.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Tomorrow will be a killer.\\
What are you up to tonight?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I can drive if you like tomorrow?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Need to shower and then some games today.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hopefully we can be somewhat good like yesterday\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That would be great, thank you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah well enjoy and good luck\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh the bathroom stuff has arrived\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh nice. Just a few jobs for us to do then :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: My flat is just boxes now\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you want to try and do some of it on Saturday?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nicky is getting her keys on Friday so we're going to help her move on Saturday morning so it might have to wait a little\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok. Maybe we can tackle it in between jobs.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You were typing?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I was going to ask if that meant you weren’t going to do parkrun but then thought I could just ask about it tomorrow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah it will I think\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Can I ask you about something that's been on my mind?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sure\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Was there a reason you thought me joining you and Toria for the run today might have been an issue?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: no, I didn't think it would have been an issue at all but I would have checked because we meet at her parents house. We don't just meet in the car park. I dont think she or her parents would have minded but I wouldn't have wanted to assume that just turning up with someone else would have been ok\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ok\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: is that ok? I thought something was off this morning when I mentioned it\\
It seems normal to me that if someone else is going to join a planned thing you would let people know that someone else was coming\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah of course it's okay. You just said you needed to check which made me think something might have happened\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: ahh ok. It wasn't that anything had happened. Not with Toria anyway although there is always something happening with someone in her family.\\
I sometimes seem to overcheck things in terms of who is going where. Sorry.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's just that obviously I want to get along with your friends so got worried there might have been something\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was nothing like that. Everyone who you have met really like you.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How did the games go tonight?\\
I've pottered to bed. My brain is absolute mush.\\Night night. Hope you sleep well x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\I like you\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Very much a mixed bag but fun tonight.\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: After I’ve finished breakfast I can start on some work. Will go for a walk before lunch and then more work before our thing later.\\
What time did you want to get there? It says it starts at 6 but no bingo until 8. I’m assuming they want people to buy food.\\I was planning to eat first.\\No idea why I was waking up. When I did it felt like the covers were stuck or it’s just my brain worried I was missing my alarm or something.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope the weather doesn't go crazy for your walk again today.\\
I just asked Sandra and she'll be getting there between 6.30-7. shall we do the same? I'll also try to eat at home, just depends what time I can leave here\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: We can do that time. I’ll make sure I’m ready for 6:15 and you can let me know later what time works.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Brilliant. Thank you :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just getting home now. Fried brain, will get some food and get ready.\\
How was your day?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Was just about to ask how you were doing. Days been Ok, got quite a bit done but have had to stop to get ready. Should be able to finish up the whole assignment tomorrow. Which is good. Then can switch back to astrophysics.\\
Some quite fun code today.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: At least bingo doesn’t need much brain power\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well done on getting loads done today:smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: sounds like a productive day. Did you go for the walk?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully I'd at least will be able to hold a conversation.\\
What time shall we say?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah I managed a walk. Saw a super lazy duck just going with the flow.\\
Time is up to you. I’ll be ready to leave from 6 onward to get you.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Super lazy duck :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Shall we say you leave at 6.15?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep, I’ll message as I’m walking out the door.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. See you soon x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Should I wear black or blue jeans?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh. Are the black ones that make your bum look good?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have no idea I can’t see :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are they the ones I like?\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hope school is as easy at it can be today. 8 days left after today.\\

They were talking about the pillows on the radio this morning as well.\\I have the normal simba pillow and I really like it.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah boo. He's really not giving a shit on Thursdays.\\
A morning run might be a good idea. Could you run to the gym?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you. I'll have a look later :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That both is and isn’t a terrible idea. Not the nicest run route regardless of what gym I go to.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well I do have both terrible and not terrible ideas :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
The route is not great but it does get the distance in\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What are you up to today?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It would be a good \/ annoying distance.\\
Crazy crazy plans today. Want to finish my assignment. Will go for a walk.\\Got a tutorial at 7 probably some games after.\\Might try and sneak a few minutes to mess about with the resin printer. I ran a test print and not checked it yet. Trying to dial in the quality.\\You still seeing Patricia after work?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I haven't stopped today.\\
Sounds like a nice productive day for you. Hope the work goes well.\\Yes, just for a quick coffee\/walk. She's been out of the country for ages\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Does your afternoon look any better or is it just full speed all day?\\
I've ordered some more of that chickpea curry BTW.\\Do you need any shopping bits as I have an order coming tomorrow evening I can add to if you like.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's just a massively full on day today\\
Oh nice! We need to try the others still. Maybe next weekend?\\Thank you, I think I'm alright for bits :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\How's work going?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah we can try out a new curry next week.\\
Work seems to be going well. Just got a couple of parts of a question to finish off and then can let it sit for a while.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah well done! Good job getting it done.\\
My brain is absolute mush\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hopefully you can relax a bit this evening\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm just picking up some fruit from Lidl and then finally home. What time is your tutorial?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Mmmm fruit :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Have you seen Patrica?\\Tutorial is at 7. Hoping it’s good as not really in the mood for it.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha. You know I love it :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Yea, we grabbed a coffee and went for a stroll around the rye.\\Ah hope it's interesting! Enjoy\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Tutorial was actually pretty good.\\
Matt is playing cricket on Saturday :man-facepalming: so dinner won’t be until about 8pm or I should say we won’t be going to the restaurant until 8pm.\\Is that ok or should I reschedule\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I'm glad it was good. What was it on?\\
It's okay. Will give me a chance to have a nap :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\Are you okay with late dinner?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was on gravitational lensing.\\
I’m ok with a late dinner. Well not really as I might be chewing my arm off but I’m ok with late. 7 or 6:30 would have been better but these things are expected when Matt “plans”\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki, let's do it then :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm already in bed and hopefully will get some sleep.\\
Hope the games are going well.\\Night night. Sleep well when you do.\\x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good luck on the sleep.\\

It took me ages to get to sleep too. I feel absolutely broken :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\What time do you have Hannah?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: 7:30. So I’ve got time. Friday is the latest I have a fitness thing in the week and somehow the hardest to get up for. Doesn’t make sense.\\
Sorry you’re broken. Just tired or has the pain gone up as well?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's probably because it's the end of the week so it's the hardest. I struggle waking up on Friday and it's exact same time as every other day :woman-shrugging-light-skin-tone:\\
Very fatigued and half my body seems to be frozen and in pain.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Frozen and in pain. That’s new and sounds horrid\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m knackered\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Awwwww puppy :smiling-face-with-hearts::smiling-face-with-hearts::smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm guessing she's going to be picked up by the time I'll be getting back?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I bet. What's the plan for today?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Maybe. Think she is being picked up around 4\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Survive :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I'll still be here :confused-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha. And on top of that?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was PT?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Booooo\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: After surviving I will be sitting. She is either asleep or a crack addict but also seeing Chris this evening.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good and brutal. Deadlifts again. 3x8x150\\
Starting to feel strong again this week.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahahah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What time are you meeting Chris?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh amazing! Well done. And I'm so glad you're starting to feel strong again :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ve got shopping arriving between 5-6. Will head to Marlow after that and once I’ve eaten. I’m not expecting a late night\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Puppy is crazy\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh cool. Hope it's a nice evening\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: how so?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You doing anything later?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: She found a piece of brick in my garden, which I thought was a stick and was chewing on that. She now just spent the last few minutes chewing on her foot instead of the toys she has\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No haven't planned anything\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: the joys of puppyhood\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: She is very cute but I’ve no idea how you would have a puppy on your own. I guess you just get on with it but it would be very hard\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: CBT bath could be a good idea\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah it would be really hard. Definitely not going anywhere for a while\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I survived :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Woo hoo. I'm still at school\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Pics?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Me send you or you send me :winking-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Puppy pics\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Little crackhead :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Crackhead in the morning and after lunch she had 2 mega naps\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I was thinking about Becky and the situation.\\
If she's like I can have a chat with our safeguarding lead, obvs anonymous and all that?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I can ask her. Would this be you talking to them or for her to talk to them?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Me talking to them. Just to see or there are any things that a school should\/ could do\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok, I’ll ask.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. Please say absolutely no pressure but I thought while I'm still here I might get some info.\\
Just leaving now :sleeping-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I assume you’ve made it home?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah, took me like 45mins\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You're off out?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah just parked. Hope you get to relax a bit now\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x\\
Did you have a good time last night?\\I don't actually know - texted her yesterday but haven't heard back yet. Probably around 10.\\Are you off to PR?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was just a bit odd yesterday, felt like I was in the way somehow.\\
Bit of a chill morning until moving then.\\How are you feeling compared to yesterday?\\Just parked up, I’m guessing it could be quiet today with the marathon tomorrow. Will see\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that's weird. Tell me all about it later.\\
Nicky just texted and apparently she has enough people this morning so I don't need to go. So I'm still in bed. Will sort out the flat.\\Yeah it might be. But it's also a lovely day it seems. Is Toria coming?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Super so morning for you then.\\
Yeah Toria should be here, going to repeat last week. See how it goes. My legs are dead from yesterday\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope it's goes well. Apparently alternate course again this morning\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep and it’s currently fucking freezing\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh nooo :face-with-tears-of-joy: It looks so sunny through the window\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm in Starbucks with the girls\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: On my way\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Lovely seeing you :relieved-face:\\
What are you up to today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Same :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
Not quite sure yet. I’ve got some house jobs to do plus I’m delaying lunch a bit as we will be having dinner late. Probably try and do some robot stuff but got to put clothes away, tidy up my utility room a bit and got to try and get this damn toilet to stop leaking.\\What are you up to?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That is a lot of stuff!\\
I'm just having some food, then nap and then some flat stuff. Shower hair and get ready\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to (very) slowly start getting ready and be with your around 6.30?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is slowly. Sounds good.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You ok driving or do you want me to drive?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll drive :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I mean I just stood in my dressing gown for 15mins drinking water so yes, very slow :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to feed the cat and head over\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: ok, see you in a bit\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Home!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done. That was a fun evening.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes I had a lovely time\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Right. This might not be the best way to say this. But I've tried and chickened out a few times now :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I love you :red-heart:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: If you're not there yet that is perfectly fine. I just wanted to tell you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I thought you were sending me a “made it to bed” message :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
I can think of at least 3 times you’ve chickened out.\\I am there and have been for a few weeks. It’s been going round and round in my head. It’s not something I’ve felt for a very long time and it does scare me a bit.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I love you :red-heart:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, you see, I'm so easy to read :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
It's been going round in my head too but didn't want to freak you out if you weren't there yet.\\It's been a very long time since I've said\/felt it too and it is scary\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And I am in bed now :face-with-tears-of-joy: <This message was edited>\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x\\
How did you sleep?\\Almost - just getting dressed\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha enjoy!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Slept ok but woke up early. Clearly super excited about the race :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Good luck with the gym. Let me know what the new bit is like.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Clearly :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Will do\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's vroom vroom going?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just finished. Not a bad race. Bit dull near the end but some good action.\\
How was the gym?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Gym was good. Did arms and shoulders and then had a sneaky hip thrust sesh after I spotted a glute machine upstairs. Just making breakfast with the marathon on\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you do all the workout upstairs or is it better downstairs?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I did majority downstairs and just the last three upstairs (cable machine was busy down and then glute thingy upstairs) I was alone there for most of it, bliss\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Gym is always better when it’s empty. Only 5 of us in the gym on Friday\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Chris c and Sarah w have already set off\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That has to be one of the advantages of being quick. You can start early. I bet loads have to wait on the line for nearly an hour before they even start.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah Holly and Mireille haven't started yet but they are about 4 h 30 i think\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Which is still super fast. If you were doing your first and on for a 6 hour one you might not start till after 11. A very long day.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They are all very speedy\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Michelle did the night backwards one in 4.34\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Very much a hurry up and wait morning.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s insane\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: 6am bedtime :yawning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Literally\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: More impressive than doing it now\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Me and Katie got back at 8 am from ours\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Urgh\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's so hard overnight and without spectators\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The 2 all nighters I’ve done were not worth it. Hurts way too much to lose a nights sleep\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It completely broke me\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The wheelchairs look cool\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They do!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Must be so hard. Just heard the heart rate is 195\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ouch. Mine hurts at 180\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It must be so weird being all folded in that chair\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Only if they have legs\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well yes\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Otherwise it’s just leaning forward\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The amount of people\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Fuck the waiting to even start\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It looks like my London to Brighton event. 12+ hours to do a 5 hour event\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The elites are on track for like 2.15 :exploding-head:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I still don’t understand the pacers. Are they paid to run and then drop back. They are faster than the fast people\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think they must be\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: 2:15 is slow now isn’t it? For elite level?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So this one guy has 3 pacers around him\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I guess for wind\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't think the Pacers do the whole marathon\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah but how and why is he special enough to get the special treatment. Doesn’t that mean second or third place is harder to get\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I don't know\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good find\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I might have a half hour nap and then get on with cleaning\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Enjoy.\\
The nap that is. Cleaning is not fun.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you over napped\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes yes I have\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just went through my alarms again\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: As in you turned them all off or never heard them go off? <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Turned two off and didn't hear the last one :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: At least it’s only 1pm.\\
You probably needed the extra nap. Do you feel better for it?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I do feel alright but still can feel the migraine lurking\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your morning been?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Can you do anything to keep the migraine away?\\
It’s been ok. Watched a bit of the marathon after the race and have had lunch. I’m about to do something. I just need to see what that is. Hoping for some inspiration as I walk up stairs.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've been trying. I'm hydrated, I've stretched, it's just not budging.\\
Hahahah. Well let me know when inspiration strikes you\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Omg Kris finished in 3.17 apparently\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s insane\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: So fast\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What’s double crazy is that professional are an hour faster\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The professionals just blow my mind. I can't imagine that kind of fitness\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I can’t even see the path you’d need to take to get that fast.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Genetics for one and bloody hard work. At the beginning they said only Kenya and Ethiopia got London marathon golds ever\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: but in theory anyone could train to Kris's level and I dont see a path to that. Would have to be multiple years of singular traininng\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh definitely. And he has been training in a very focused way the last two three years. And he has a runners physique too. I don't think I'd ever be able to train to that level\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I'd certainly rather be stronger than faster. Would still like to be "comfortable" running a 10k. to the point that I could do it with the promise of a medal at the end\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We can get there. Once I'm out of the job we can go running together\\
I was talking to the girls yesterday and I said I might consider Oxford half as this year's goal\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sarah finished in 3.32 :exploding-head:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Whens the Oxford half? I don't mind 10's but I dont really want to do a half. I've not finished a 10 thinking I could run that again.\\
Amazing. I guess that is the reward for all the hard training\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's October. It's quite a nice flat one. I've been to cheer before\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well they don’t seem to have a 10k on the same day.\\
How’s the cleaning gone \/ going?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh boo. I'll see how I feel after Marlow and think about it then\\
Almost done, just bed and hoovering to do.\\What did you end up doing?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Marlow 5 should be a good benchmark\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh wow. Looks cool! Is it working and all?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah it work. You turn the knob on the top to change the number. You can also control it with a servo. It would make a very big clock.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's amazing. Well done :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thoughts while hoovering....\\
If you knew I chickened out 3 times , why didn't you put me out of my misery? :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I thought you’d ask that. I should just keep more quiet :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
I was only pretty sure what you were going to say and I didn’t know how it would go or what I was going to say.\\It’s happened before where I didn’t immediately react the way you expected and so I didn’t want it to be a thing where you ended up being upset.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: you're starting to knowe so well :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
That's why I chickened out - I didn't know what you were going to say...\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I learn eventually.\\
Objectively isn’t it an issue if you won’t say stuff through fear of my reaction?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Probably. But you did the same, no?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: well yes. I wasn't suggesting it something i'm good at.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well we both need to get better I guess\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: To be honest, I often don't worry about telling you stuff. Obviously I wouldn't want you to be upset about something. Just on this occasion I felt particularly vulnerable\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: There is some danger loop lurking somewhere.\\
I know you get defensive when vulnerable (no doubt I do as well) then I fear the defensive reaction is going to be some attack on stuff I do. With the end result (in my mind) being that I’m having to apologise for at least 2 things.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Do I get defensive?\\
Have I attacked stuff you do before?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: (genuine questions)\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Defensive yes. Attacked no.\\
As you’ll ask for an example. :grinning-face:\\The last one was when I agreed with you after you said you hadn’t  been all that helpful with my vasectomy recover work. You then got defensive, or that what I thought it was, as you pointed out you’d been sick etc.\\which of course I already knew. I’d just agreed with you I wasn’t blaming you. Then felt I should have said something or I’d somehow answered wrong by agreeing with you.\\The other Friday I thought you got defensive on the sofa after you told me not to touch you, which is why I shut down a bit.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You do know me :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Promise, on both of those occasions I did not get defensive. Or at least I wasn't aiming to come across like that. I think this might have been a misunderstanding there. I obviously am very aware that I have been unwell for a long time and we haven't had as much intimate times as either of us would have liked, so I worry about that which is where my saying that would have come from.\\And I have already said that I was joking that Friday and didn't think you were going to take it like that and I did apologise.\\I sometimes feel like you still attribute actions\/reactions to me that you've experienced in previous relationships which is why I am sometimes more hesitant to say or do something because I don't want you to shut down or spiral in your mind without talking to me about it.\\I think it would be good if we could go back to the complete cards on the table as in the beginning. I appreciated the chats we had the first couple of months :red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I might be misinterpreting situations then (pretty sure I am)\\
For me. If I say something and the response is an example of when I’ve done the thing or an example of something else I’ve done. Then I think that person is being defensive.\\I know you apologised for the Friday. I only used it as a defensive example. Nothing more.\\I certainly still predict stuff based on my past. I’d like to think that most people do.\\If you’ve always been told 1+1=3 it takes a while to see that isn’t the right answer.\\It’s probably as much if not more my overthinking than past relationships. My brain defaults to a negative reaction. So the safest way for my brain to not get a negative response is to shut down or just not say things.\\I like the cards on the table as well (apart from the heart rate spike). I’m not sure if this counts or just an overthink example.\\I would like us to be more intimate than we have been but I also know that you already know this. It was in your last message. I also know that we haven’t been because of how sick you have been feeling plus the drugs taking the desire away. So I know I have to wait until you say so. I can’t make a move or anything because you’d have already said if you felt ok. So I don’t talk about it because I think (this is where I am possibly wrong) this puts you under pressure and it creates a scenario for me to feel rejected.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Rather than defensive, I feel the need to explain myself so I'm not misunderstood (this does come from my childhood).\\
You are right, we all do it sometimes. But how can I reassure you of the opposite? That I'm not automatically going to have a negative reaction?\\Ha, the heart rate spike will calm down in time.\\To be completely honest, I'd love for you to make a move, it would make me feel wanted and desired. If I had the energy I'd jump you every time I see you and it's constantly at the back of my mind that I'm not meeting this need for either of us.\\And one more thing, I'm not going to reject you in the way you might think I would.\\I am in this from head to toes\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I don’t know the answer to those questions. I know I need to push myself to ask stuff.\\
I’m not sure how I can make a  move (I have no moves btw) when I know you’re not feeling good. Surely that just makes me selfish. Trying to put my needs above your pain and forcing you to either - go through with it (no thank you) or reject me. Which is what I expected anyway but now with the bonus of me being a dick for making a move when you know your partner isn’t in the mood.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m sorry I haven’t been making you feel wanted or desired. It’s was an attempt to be respectful.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Please do ask stuff. You know I'm never not going to be honest and transparency will help both of us to be the best versions :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
I'm sure you have moves. And I think by now you can tell when I'm alright and when I'm unwell. I don't know what to do with the fact that you expect my rejection. I love you and I want you - I don't know if I can be clearer than that :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know and I really do appreciate you giving me space to feel better and wait for me. It would just be nice to show me\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think I can tell when you’re alright vs unwell. Mainly because you say. Maybe I’ve been very wrong but in my mind the last 2 times we’ve had sex have been the only 2 times when you’ve  felt well and we’ve been together and not in public. The zoo would have been another day but I had zero expectation we’d have sex at the zoo :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You are probably right. I had plans for last weekend and this but this god awful period ruined them :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I was thinking about whether you've set up the app for that new toy you got?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm all tucked in. 2 more Mondays to go.\\
Night night, hope you sleep well x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah I set it up, charged it (I think). There a lost more modes in the app than I was expected. Could be hilarious for me \/ shocking for you. As the off button isn’t immediately obvious.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
Hope you sleep well.\\7 days left :partying-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Can't wait :grinning-face:\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x\\
How did you sleep?\\Almost, just having breakfast (overslept :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:)\\Normal day today and exams tomorrow, got so much stuff to do.\\The best spin class this morning?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You’ll get it done.\\
Slept ok. Longer would have been better.\\Did you miss your alarm again? At least you didn’t mega oversleep.\\Yep and then Hannah at 10:30. Switched up to do legs again today.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I did and apparently snoozed one and woke up to it at 5.45\\
So weird.\\Big morning for you again! Hope it all goes well :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s seems to be what I do on a Friday. Part of your brain is already done with waking up early and know the end is neigh\\
Another good spin class. Now the legs are completely dead for my leg session :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm glad it was another good class. How great would it be if she completely took over from Joseph.\\
What's your plan for today (except Hannah)\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It would be good. Trying to get her to do a Wednesday class. Will see.\\
Got to do some astrophysics today as I haven’t done any while working on my cosmology assignment. Will see how far I get with it.\\Won’t do much work tomorrow due to puppy.\\Have you got anything on after school today?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nice and productive day for you. How was session with Hannah?\\
Yes, probably y11s for interventions and then need to get my cover done for tomorrow and Thur\/Fri.\\But got told I can do parents evening from home because I only have like 10 booked in\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: The sweat hides my tears :loudly-crying-face:\\
Good session. Did some squats and then some horrid hyrox inspired circuit of pain.\\How have you still got interventions to do?\\Small victory for Wednesday though.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That tough eh?\\
Well the exams are Tue and Thurs so the good kids(who don't need anything) are trying to do better.\\Definitely a small victory. He booked out an hour for me to get home and set up. So I can potter in between. Just need to make sure cat doesn't show his arse\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: No point sessions being easy but the circuit are killer.\\
Oh it for the exams. I thought they were making you do detention or something.\\Spud could be the entertainment for people :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\Your out out Friday night? With school. Just checking my memory\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well done for doing it.\\
I mean they tried to put me on detention duty on Thursday but I was like nah\\Yup out for dinner in London with the department. Are you doing anything?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done for saying no.\\
No going out plans yet but I’ve got plenty to do and not spending money won’t hurt me.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh same. I need a couple of quiet weeks :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's work going?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not started yet. Just finished getting dressed and about to have lunch. Totally knackered now so I’m hoping it not super difficult\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sending all the productive vibes\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thank you.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: There is always something getting in the way. I thought I'd quickly print out the last assignment so I can reference it while working.\\
Short version. My printer is knackered and will not work even after spending over an hour trying to fix it. So have ordered a new one.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh bugger. Is it since you tried printing for me?\\
I just finished with y11s - they didn't want to leave :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: its seems that your form was its last "successful" print and few prints before that were a bit dodgy. A real pain but I've bought a laser printer now so hopefully it will have more life in it.\\
Aww, that's nice.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Do you need anything printed? I'm still at work\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thanks but its ok. It wasn't even urgent. Just turned into a whole job I didn't need. Seems like I do need a working scanner for my exams next month but think the phone will work as a backup anyway.\\
New printer should arrive tomorrow or Wednesday\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah cool.\\
I've just parked at home. So much traffic. I'm broken\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What are you up to tonight?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s a super long day.\\
Not sure yet. Just having dinner, jerk chicken. Might watch a film.\\Would play games but I suspect that won’t be happening today. Matt’s mum died last night.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no. I am so sorry, please send my condolences.\\
How is he doing?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: About as well as can be expected. More relief than anything mixed with the expected sadness.\\
It’s been a long time coming. Not that it makes it easier. I think on balance it makes it worse.\\The extra problem it has now created is Matt could have had the house sold last week but because Matt is Matt he didn’t and now they have to wait for probate before the house can be sold. I think there is now extra tax implications as well for all involved.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh it's a crap situation all around. Sending my love their way. Even though it was long time coming it must be so hard\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've had to put the heating back on, so cold.\\
How's your evening been?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s is freezing.\\
Have ended up playing games as Matt wanted the distraction.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's good. Hope it took his mind of things.\\
I'm already tucked in\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to say night night now in case I nod off.\\
Hope you sleep well x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night x x x x x x x x x   Hope you sleep well.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have a follow up question from yesterday. What do I need to do to make you feel more desired?\\
\section*{Tuesday $23\textsuperscript{rd}$}
Google was not very helpful and in my mind I thought I was doing it. When we are together we kiss, hug and i'm touching \/ stroking you. This is me wanting you.\\I did realise that I did completely mess up telling you how great and sexy you looked on Saturday. Your hair especially was super hot. I do like it with curls.\\I know I need to do more verbal compliments, they are still hard for me.\\:red-heart:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
Big question for a very early morning so please bear with me in case I don't express myself as well as I could.\\First of all you didn't mess up on Saturday, you did tell me I looked lovely.\\I think it might be the initiating things. Yes, we kiss and hug and snuggle and tell each other we like each other but I feel that often I tend to start it off - I know this is probably because you're taking into account how I'm feeling in terms of pain etc which is very sweet and I appreciate you.\\And you're right, I do need more words of affirmation - I like to be told all the silly little things, and how you feel about me, etc etc but I also know that you're working on it.\\I do know that you want me but sometimes it would just be nice to be told :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:. We'll get there, we're still working each other out on the more nuanced bits.\\:red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00015548-GIF-2024-04-23-06-17-37.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha don't worry. Feel free to share your thoughts later on in the day.\\
I'm tired, but more mentally than anything. Nervous about the exams today, it's my low ability lot and just hoping the brain fog won't fuck up my timings\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you got prompt cards for yourself with the exam?\\
I think it’s the kids that are meant to be nervous.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: If it’s a time thing can you have the stop watch running on your phone?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes we do.\\
But it's a lot of things to do at the same time - reading the prompts word for word, timing each segment separately and together, writing notes, recording, making sure they answer things, making sure I don't help them :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:, having the right combination of the 4 elements for each kid\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh crap.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I do. I've done these exams loads of times. There are just too many things that can go pear shaped :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s all sounds unnecessarily difficult for all involved.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Them's the exams :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We're the only department where we have to examine as well as everything else. I'm not even thinking about the admin I'll be doing on Friday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s far too nice of you to have stayed just to do this bit for the kids.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But I've been with them since y7 and it's less stressful for them to have me do the exam rather than someone they don't know\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That totally makes sense. Just add the stress onto you instead.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes :confused-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was spin?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Very meh. Just so mentally boring.\\
When’s your first exam? Just waiting for the monster to arrive\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh booo.\\
In like 3 mins.\\Send pics to keep me motivated :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Babyyyyy. But she's grown so much already\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh my goooooooood :smiling-face-with-heart-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I thought she couldn't go out until Friday? Or is it just meet new dogs?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Mark said she could go for a road walk. No meeting of dogs.\\
You do forget. You can go for a walk or you can take the dog for a walk. They are different :grinning-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: How have the exams gone?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha I can imagine, especially with a pup that's not trained yet\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: As expected. Had one breakdown already but they are all trying so that's all I can ask for\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Only one breakdown. That’s pretty good.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But they are all literally shaking with nerves\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That makes sense\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And I only had to chase one up who didn't turn up :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What was there excuse?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I thought it was later\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :man-facepalming:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What are you up to today except puppy care?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s pretty much it. Mum is coming over this afternoon and I have a tutorial at 7.\\
Don’t expect the puppy to be picked up until maybe 5 so won’t get any other work done.\\How many more exams do you have?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think 8 more but spread out.\\
Say hello to mum for me\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oof\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've already done 8\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Same number on Thursday?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes I think so. Thursday is a mixed group too and should be less painful\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: \url{https://www.instagram.com/reel/C5i7zXdICX3/?igsh=M2w4cTVwNmQxaHhl}\\
My day\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Oh dear. That brought back a flashback to my German speaking exam.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh you two. Having the best day while I'm sitting here\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Cutest little face\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: She has been knackered after our walk but it’s waking up.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Awewwww\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How many left?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 2\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Then your done?\\
See if they have an aquarium of tiny elephants as pets :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What???\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Isn’t that something they might say as a response. Like from the insta reel you sent me\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahahahah soz, mushy brain\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes..\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Might be something to star and read later but here is a bit more of a brain dump on the initiating stuff. Hopefully it makes some sense, I’m not sure it would make any more sense if I tried to say it out loud. These aren’t in any order.\\
I will say that if I verbalised all the times I want you it would  very much be the same answer to the question “Are you hungry” unless I ate 30-60 minutes ago the answer will be yes because I’m always hungry.\\In thinking about it quite a lot I think I have multiple thought loops that are working against me.\\A general low self esteem doesn’t help along with the overthinking.\\I’ve been trying to come up with some sort of coherent statement but I’ve not got one so maybe if I just throw out some thought processes. Might give you some insight that can then be picked at.\\I’m also aware of the different response desire models and even knowing that while someone isn’t currently “in the mood” they could quickly become so if prompted.\\I think I’m used to initiating either in the morning or in the evening when already in bed or just before \/ after bed. In thinking why it comes down to already having taken clothes off and not being in the middle of doing something else. Not really something we have had a lot of success with yet and bed time would probably be bad anyway due to the evening drugs you take.\\One of the main thought loops I have is that if we are together and you wanted us to be doing something sexual then we would be and if we aren’t then it’s because we are doing something else or your not feeling great or just not feeling it and I can’t change that. In my mind me suggesting anything will get a no response followed by some starting build up of resentment caused because I should have known better.\\Not sure if this is linked to initiation or not but you already know I’m not great at asking for things. But guess this is linked to initiation as it is me asking for sex or some sort of intimacy. For some reason this feels like I’m then forcing you or obligating you to do something you don’t want to do and why would I force someone I love to do something they don’t want to do. I think it also feels like a weakness, on me. Like if I have to ask then I don’t need or deserve. That I know is wrong but not quite sure how to reverse that. I think it’s one of these walls I need to knock down.\\Christmas Day is an example of where I feel I obligated you into it.\\Another thought process I can explain with a scenario. Takelast Saturday. You arrive, looking insanely good. Of course I want you but I know you’re on your period so nothing is going to happen. In my mind any suggestion I make is me being wildly insensitive. Same applies to the week before.\\Then if we replace you being on your period with a day you’ve told me you’re super tired, in extra pain, stomach pains etc. In my mind I’m just a jerk to suggest anything.\\I don’t know if any of that helps, hinders, angers, infuriates, etc but that what’s going on in my brain.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I read it and I'll reply, just sorting things out post exams :purple-heart:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Enjoy. At least the exams are done\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to pop to Aldi on my way back - do you need anything?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m good thanks. Puppy is still here though\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: <attached: 00015615-AUDIO-2024-04-23-15-39-57.opus>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Probably picked up in an hour.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: There is so much traffic everywhere :sleeping-face: I am pooped\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Booo,\\
Dog has gone now\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Boooo\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was your day?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Bit tiring. Not drunk enough.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh get that water down ya\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Right I'm finally settled. Sorry, just needed some food and decompress.\\
I might have to screenshot parts and reply to each so I don't forget anything :smiling-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s completely understandable.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think this might be the bit I’m either misunderstanding or just not getting and could be linked to me not being great at the words of affirmation.\\
What’s an example phrase? <This message was edited>\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think I half explain later in the book of a message that I’ve probably also pre-decided or workout that for some reason or another your just not in the mood anyway.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It might be to do with the words of affirmation. I don't know, just like you used to tell I'm I'm amazing and stuff :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: God I hope what I wrote makes sense :grinning-face-with-sweat:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Its seems to. Just in my tutorial so will give it a proper read after. Thank you for taking the time on in it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: If you dont know what you want to hear how am I meant to say it :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Concentrate on your tutorial!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But if I were to put words in your mouth it would defeat the point, wouldn't it? Just tell me your thoughts and feelings\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: True but an example could be helpful. I've thought of some things I could work on.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I really like having clothes taken off as well and I like taking yours off\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What did you think of?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It is unfair of me to put it all on you and I can see where I can do better.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: For clarification. does cuddle = hugs or are you talking more?\\
What do you mean by "check in"\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sorry, cuddles and more.\\
By checking in I mean to ask me\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: its more of an essence of an idea rather than a full on answer. I think I need to get better at flirting\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm just jumping in the shower so will catch up with the rest when I'm out\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: ok\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: this might be a stupid thing to say but when you say "ask me"\\
Do you mean just straight up ask "Do you want to have sex?"\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not a stupid thing to say at all. Maybe something more subtle, to see how I'm feeling. Because sometimes I might be a bit tired (I am always in pain) but still would like to get frisky :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: something like "Want a cuddle" "would you like to go upstairs (obviously not if we are at your place)"\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah those are good :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: sorry if that seems picky\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It does not. I love that we can communicate like this so please don't apologise for asking questions\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I just need to get better at asking this stuff in the moment and not spend hours thinking about how to work it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes please. I promise you, you can ask me anything\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm not going to revoke the promise\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know I can ask. It’s sometimes the answer I  fear <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm thinking that the answer in your head is worse than whatever I am going to say\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yes but what if there not :man-facepalming:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know that why I have to ask\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know myself quite well. I don't think I'd want to intentionally hurt you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Exactly\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I don’t think you would either and I have to try and remember a quote that I like\\
“What if it turns out better than you can imagine”\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :hundred-points: that\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: All of this, can turn out the best thing for both of us. You never know\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Indeed. I’d like it to\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Me too\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm glad we can talk about everything. And honestly please don't ever worry about an answer or whatever and just talk to me. It will save both of us a whole load of mental space :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll keep telling you until you believe it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That might be what it takes\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Then so be it. I'm here for it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was the tutorial?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Pretty good. It was a good tutor who explains well.\\
Now just playing a few games\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah that's good!\\
Enjoy the games, hope Matt is as well as can be\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm all tucked in and will turn in soon\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning :red-heart: x x x x x x x x x x\\
I'm tired, this week is definitely trying to finish me off.\\How are you? Did you sleep well?\\What's the plan for today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Slept pretty well. Woke up way before me alarm. The house is freezing :cold-face:\\
Plan for today is work, want to go over my assignment and make sure that is done. Have already hovered.\\Got my new printer to setup and might be having a catch up with Becky in between her work and a gym class she has.\\At least you still get to do parents evening for home. So a slightly early finish? Or an early leave school.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Saturday, did you want to build some furniture?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It was so cold at mine too I had to have heating on last two nights.\\
Ah sounds like a productive day. Say hello to Becky for me and let me know if she wants me to ask around (only if it's not overstepping)\\Yes at least that. Not early finish because I have 3 appts after 6 but I'll be going home at 2.15\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh would love that. I might be going for lunch though just don't know what time\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok, probably not then. Who you going to lunch with?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Should be Agi and the girls but not sure what's happening\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Will text her tomorrow to if there are any plans\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: ok, are we still making one of those curry's for dinner and do I need to order anything for them. I have all the stuff from last time minus poppadum's (which I can order) and I have chicken\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'd like that. Don't worry I can get all the stuff for the curry, will have a look what it needs :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have chicken in the freezer so dont buy that. Just need to know so I can defrost.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. Will have a look either today or tomorrow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, yes me.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well done! But definitely bigger!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just got home. Had my last y11 lesson. They made me a little card with messages from everyone :loudly-crying-face: and we took a class photo and I almost cried\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: awww, that really nice of them. A good memory to end on then.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Definitely :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm definitely going to miss the kids\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: you mean - the good kids when they are nice or all the kids all the time\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: but I get it must be nice teaching people stuff and seeing them get it and understand it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The first one :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It is. I've seen them go from y7 to y11 in my classes\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: are you all set for parents afternoon? comfy trousers on with business up top\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just setting up.\\
And yes, comfy on the bottom, business on the top :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your day been?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Its another day where I question everything. I've been stuck on what I though was an easy question. Had to take one for the team and ask the dumb question on the forum. Got a great response that still does and doesn't make sense.\\
My mind just cannot get fractions and rearranging forumula's. They dont click at all\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh bubs. Fractions are hard and I can't even compute formulas.\\
You'll get it\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Of course it is given explicitly :face-with-rolling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: the question appears SOOOO simple\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: My brain is not even computing this\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: X is hydrogen and Y is helium\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I still don't know what they want :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The whole question is trying to get you to work out how much heavier a star would be it had 70\%\/30\% hydrogen helium vs a 75\%\/25\% star.\\
This is also assuming its a mythical star with no metals\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: how many more parents have you got to see\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Apparently loads. Quite a few booked in today. My computer is so slow :loudly-crying-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: typical parent planning then. Work computer? only 4 days left and you can throw it off a bridge or give it back\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nope my own, can't afford to chuck it off a bridge :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Also how optimistic thinking a school would give me a computer\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Do you not have a school laptop then?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nooooo\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: EH! how are you meant to do stuff then\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: On my own or at school\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: well that's mental\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Very normal in the education sector :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: not from the other teachers I've seen. The last place I think I went to where people had desktops was a secure facility where you couldn't take work home\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah desktops everywhere, offices, classrooms the lot\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: its like going back to 1998\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Maybe you've only dealt with posh school teachers :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aw a retriever puzzle\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: She is absolutely living the best life\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also she's huuuuuge\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: she could end up being quite big and Eva is already pretty thicc\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Definitely. Another bear for the family\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am pooped\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You all done?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup. Just closed the laptop. But the fact I don't have to drive home now is glorious\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What are you up to?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done. That’s the last one ever done. Amazing.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just having dinner. I’m absolutely starving and it’s freezing.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Didn’t see Becky in the end as she left work super late.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Scary! But feels good. Just the exams tomorrow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh what are you having?\\
I might put the heating on again, I'm so cold\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh booo. Hopefully soon?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was the katsu curry. Really good but I could have eaten 4 of them.\\
Becky has her kids next week so will be the week after. Did have a min catch up at spin yesterday.\\She is going a date with that Nick guy who’s profile she showed us tomorrow. That will no doubt be a story.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I love katsu curry.\\
Was it super small?\\Ooh okay - I wanna hear about it. He sets off my Spidey senses\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep, I mean it has to be for it to be less than 500 calories. Good sauce.\\
Oh yeah. He looked like a right dick head. Zero effort profile because he’s skinny and he hasn’t even set a time or place for tomorrow.\\So the whole thing might not even happen.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Random thought. Is it Marlow market this week?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that's bloody low effort. She should bin him\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Uhmmm not sure, lemme check\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: She should but I think she uses it for a distraction as much as anything else.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No, it was on on the 20th\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah but he's going to be a dick\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I bet he'll ask to meet local to him\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: They are meeting in Marlow but I’ve no idea where he is from\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-rolling-eyes::face-with-rolling-eyes::face-with-rolling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: At an undetermined place and time\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Correct\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You very much won me over with having arranged time and place within a day of talking :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was a lot easier as I knew where we both lived (Wycombe) so easy(ish) to think of a few places we could go.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And there aren’t or wasn’t any good places in Wycombe so Marlow is the obvious choice add food into that mix and the options jump out\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You'd be surprised how hard some people find it :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I found it very hard if I would meet people from further away. Do you pick a place you know and hope they drive, do you get them to suggest a place they like near them, do you find some random place in the middle and hope for the best. At least in the middle it adds to the adventure a bit.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just take the compliment :winking-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, thank you.\\
Yes I am very wise. :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll speak to my safeguarding lead either tomorrow or Friday. If there's any other info she wants to share that could help I'm happy for you to give her my number\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok, thank you.\\
I think she has tried to not think about it while at the same time not really knowing what can and can’t be done. So I think any sort of starting point will help.\\In a different world if she had £50k no doubt it would all be different and a lawyer would be doing it all.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: What are your plans for the rest of evening?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I understand. I'll see what I can find out\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't have a clue. Might watch something and then maybe read. I am really fatigued and achy. They are definitely getting their money's worth this week.\\
How about you ?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Are you reading the Project something book for your club?\\
Think I’m just watching TV. Brain is mush. Maybe Games if Matt fancies it\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, project hail Mary. It's really good, I think you'd like it. It's all about science and stars and clever things\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Y11s just sent me the class picture and I look huuuuuge\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ve read it. It’s good.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What do you mean you look huge.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I didn't realise you have\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Big\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thanks I wasn’t  really looking for a synonym.\\
But you’re not huge or big.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Children are small\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not this lot. Everyone is taller than me :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just look puffy\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :face-with-rolling-eyes:\\
Hormones and stress if you even look puffy at all.\\Last time I saw you you looked super hot.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm just not a fan of pics I guess\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But thank you :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: But I have and I have seen some *great* pics of you :winking-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: A well curated selection :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
I need to get better at liking candid pics\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Candid are hard, as proved by me in the zoo\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I love that pic\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And also. I tried to pose! :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Your a lot better at it than I am\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah well, the y11 now just have a bloody awkward photo of me :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Surely there are year book ones as well?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No year books\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did you end up playing games with Matt?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No, been watching fallout instead.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It is frustratingly slow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh how is it? I wanted to watch it?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh you answered that :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just started episode 7 and so far I only have questions with no answers\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Episode 7??\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How many are there?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: 8 in total\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m going to be annoyed if the questions don’t get answered.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that would be crap\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: They have clearly spent a LOT of money on the show\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I might give it a go if I have time. Started baby reindeer yesterday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh nice. You been doing that instead of reading?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No... I watched bones :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But I'm all tucked in now!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Haven’t you finished bones yet?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nooooooooo :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Will try get some sleep into this tired body.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well good luck. Only 4 days left to go.\\
Night x x x x x x x x x x x\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night. Sleep well. X x x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
\section*{Thursday $25\textsuperscript{th}$}
Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart: <This message was edited>\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x\\
Are you okay? Did you go to spin?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Morning x x x x x x\\
I didn’t go to spin. Just woke up. Do have a headache which I  could do without. Otherwise I’m ok.\\You all set for the exams today? Same number as Tuesday?\\:red-heart:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I got a bit worried there. Did you oversleep or didn't plan on going?\\
Hopefully loads of water will shift the headache\\Yeah just setting up for the first one. Little bit of a lighter load but longer individual exams\\What are you up to today?\\:red-heart: <This message was edited>\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I planed to not go, going out for a little run with Toria later and I thought the extra sleep would be a good idea.\\
That’s good that it’s less exams today.\\Just more work today, walk at lunch, but if a run. Think we are doing week 4 of couch to 5k. Then I’ve got that hacker group meeting in Wycombe.\\Should be a good day.\\Just need to get moving and have breakfast.\\Good luck with the exams. Hopefully you get better answers from the kids.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah cool. I'm so used to your routine in the morning I worry when it changes :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
It does sound like a good day. Hope you manage to get everything done?\\When and where is your hacker group?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sorry, I thought I’d said I was skipping spin.\\
It will all depend how much work I can do. It was all a real struggle yesterday. I’ve got to submit my assignment as well. Must not forget.\\Hacker thing is 7:30 up at the multi culture center near TGI.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll try to remind you about the assignment.\\
Do you know what you'll be doing with the hackers?\\It's so emotional today. Literally cried with every kid this morning. They are doing so well and I'm so proud of them\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Assignment submitted.\\
No idea this week. Will try and get some robot stuff done but probably not. I have 2 different mechanical 7 segment displays to show off. As you do. Will probably have a chat to Duncan about MegaCon and I need to book hotel for that.\\That's really good the kids are doing well. Just shows how amazing a teacher you have been.\\You said JJ had some sort of link \/ program. There are lots of way you could still help kids \/ people with the new job. Just imagine, you might actually have the energy for it.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well done! Hopefully you'll get your results back soon.\\
It's going to be a full on nerd evening for you :smiling-face:\\Yeah. I think that's why I'm getting so emotional finally - I know I'm really good at my job and it does make a difference. But onwards and upwards I guess\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh yeah. FULL NERD.\\
As I've said before. It was never a case that you didn't enjoy your job (or at least this bit of it, the teachy bit) or that you weren't good at it. The problem was all the other stuff of being a teacher and the very obvious fact that the job completely breaks you. Like every single time and the effect is instant.\\You have 2 weeks off, 10 days in you start to be a real human again with hopes and dreams. You can do stuff, plan things. Enjoy things. Day one of being at school. BANG, ruined for a week.\\You cannot help anyone if your broken.\\*Rule \#1*\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know, it's just these 4 days will be very emotional.\\
I'm definitely going to try to be less broken :smiling-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Love that!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What I want to do is find a way to make one about 3\/4 the size of the smaller one and then turn it into a clock. If it can be quiet enough and easy enough to build i'm sure its a money maker. More so that the dial clock I tried to make a few years ago.\\
TOO many idea's\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh it could definitely be popular. I'd have one of it was smaller and quiet :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oooooooooh niiice. All stocked up. Are you giving some to mum?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll probably give her a chickpea one to try out. Might make one with 2 tins and use it for lunches next week.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's a good idea.\\
Which one are we making on Saturday - the butter chicken?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Totally up to you but we can try a chicken one.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll have a look tonight.\\
I am so tired :sleeping-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have chicken but it’s more than the 250grams on the packet so if we do the butter chicken maybe we double up.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I can't remember what the third one is\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Nor can I.\\
How many more exams left to do?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just 2 after lunch\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They've all been so so good\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Then your done for the day?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah will hobble over to the other site and get stuff ready for tomorrow\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hobbling isn’t good\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm hurty\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Bath tonight I think\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Definitely a good idea.\\
Do you think the new drugs are doing anything? Other than the side effects.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh definitely. Overall I feel so much better. It's just these last two weeks are so so full on which is having an impact\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok. That’s good. Just thought I’d ask.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You can ask anything\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Do you know what you’re doing for Saturday lunch yet?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I haven't had a chance yet\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've texted agi.\\
Do you have any plans?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: for Saturday? Not really. Not doing park run because of Sunday. Really need to do some Robot stuff in prep for Wednesday (meet up with Duncan) and then seeing you.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Is Sunday the wolf run?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, more people going than I thought. Think its a 12pm start\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Who are you going with?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh wow\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: yeah, more than I thought.\\
We have to be there for 11:10 at the latest so lets say 11.\\90 minutes to get there. 2 hours I think for the event maybe 2.5. An easy hour of faff after and there was talk of a drink. Might be home for 6. Will see.\\You back home now?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Long day for you. Where is it?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah home now. Took me over 45mins to get from handy cross home\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: north :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: Warickshire somewhere\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: DOH, that sucks.\\
3 days left.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: The Offchurch Bury, Offchurch, Leamington Spa, CV33 9AW\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: hmmm, I really should have looked at these sooner \url{https://thewolfrun.com/info/obstacles/}\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy: bring a lot of warm clothes to change into\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Is Cally well enough to do it?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Leg wise yes. She has some issue with her feet but they aren't new\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well please don't break yourself\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: that is the plan\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i dont have time to be broken again\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to get myself some food and throw myself in the bath\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: good plan. Could i suggest that you the just gently step into the bath rather than take a running leap. Throw in a kettle or 2 of hot water though\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh good point, I'm going to boost the water\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: and or use the shower to add more hot but get its blazing\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm so cold today\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: its freezing again. I boosted the heating already\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've just put my on\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's almost may!!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Btw just got a j\&j email with my first two week onboarding schedule\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i think this is the longest i have needed heating in the last 20 years\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Literally\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: oh nice\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: or has it terrified you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Slightly :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But Wednesday is 100th anniversary bash and then team social after work\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: the first Wednesday you start?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That will be really good\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah, I'll literally meet everyone\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll be pooped for Marlow 5 :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: yep, but that is on the Sunday\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You might have to just gently pat me and feed me Friday and Saturday :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :face-with-tears-of-joy: wont Friday be a WFH day? you could nap and Thursday is hospital as well\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thursday is WFH and Friday apparently TBC\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: easy\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am very emotional today and swinging wildly between being very sad leaving and starting to get excited about the new start\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: that sounds about the right balance. You should take a moment (in the bath maybe) to be proud of what you achieved as a teacher.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Today really made me feel like a good teacher. I know they were the "good" kids but they did everything I told them to and they were just so brilliant\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That's a good note to end on as well. You made a point of staying to help with the exams and it has clearly paid off. For the kids at least.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes it is. It's going to be cry fest next week :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also I keep getting chocolates so you're in luck\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: oh god\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not loads, just a few. But the cards from kids are so lovely\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And some shells for your mum :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: brilliant\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, at least he is awake\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: He's not\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, might just have to make a  noise then\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What have you got for dinner tonight?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :face-with-tears-of-joy: silly cat. You’re going to have to dig deep and move him. I think you need that bath.\\
Jerk chicken tonight. Was good, I cannot place what the main spice is but I do like jerk seasoning\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I managed it, he's giving me the stinkiest of eyes\\
Oh that sounds good!\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Normal cat behaviour then\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Very much so. Bath is being prepared\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have fun at the nerd group :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Enjoy the bath.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Pictures, for later obviously :winking-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Omg I've been out for ages :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: sorry!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Damn :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Bra and pants it is then :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Promise next time\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh god I'm such "sexy" girlfriend in my leggings, wet hair and hoody :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not quite the photo I was expecting :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Erm leggings (tight) = sexy\\Wet hair = super sexy\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Enjoy the book.\\
3 days left.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 3 days left :exploding-head:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to night night now in case I pass out.\\
Hope you're having a good evening and can't wait to hear about it tomorrow x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\Love you :red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night night x x x x x x  x x x\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x x\\
How was nerd night?\\It helped in getting some spoons but I feel like I've ran out on Tuesday so working on deficit :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s good that it’s helped but no so good if your still in debt.\\
You out to dinner straight from school?\\Nerd night was on. Not quite as good as last time. It was quieter, so that was good.\\Duncan had made more progress on a small little line following robot he is building for megacon. It something relatively cheap that we can have running around a track so that there is something moving for people to see.\\My 7 segment displays created some conversation.\\As always it’s interesting to just talk to people about nerd stuff.\\Like with the robot stuff it’s a shame there are so few people doing it. Needs a bit more energy or the group need a bit more of a goal.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, dinner straight after. It will be a late one.\\
Oh that sounds like a productive evening. Glad you had a good time!\\Do you have Hannah at 7.30?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Shouldn’t be mega late for you though? Is it somewhere you’ve been before?\\
Yep Hannah this morning. Arms today so that should be less painful than legs. We will see if she makes me run again.\\Do you know where you’re going for lunch tomorrow?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Probably 10ish. No we haven't been there before - a Peruvian in carnaby street.\\
Hope she doesn't break you too much.\\I have no idea what's going on. I've texted but haven't heard back so don't even know if anything is happening. I'm probably just going to do gym in the morning\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: What would I volunteer at? (Todays paired question)\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't know :face-with-tears-of-joy: I just remembered our conversation from ages ago about winning lottery\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How did I do with my answer?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You did very well. Definitely would love a small holding to potter around.\\
Ho about my answer?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Pretty good, I do think teaching spin would be fun and doing research would be fun. It’s a whole thing I’d like to chat about as I need to think about what I want to do.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Chat about with me?\\
We can definitely do that!\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yes with you.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Definitely! I'm here for it :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You done for the day now?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just about. We're leaving in a min\\
How's your day been?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I hope you have a good time.\\
Days been ok. Not much work has been done but spoke to Chris, went for a walk, cut the lawns, done 2 loads of washing. Just about to see what I might be able to answer on an assignment question\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that's been very productive! Well done. Are you doing anything tonight ?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not doing much tonight. Certainly not going out. Maybe some games or something else. Not worked any of it out yet.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope you have a nice evening :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: what's for dinner\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Its my last pre made meal thingy. I think its turkey sausage Gnochi. Actually quite good but i'm pretty sure yours will be better.\\
Do you have a discount code for Hotels.com?\\I've got complete analysis paralysis trying to pick a hotel. The one a few people have picked doesn't have AC. In JULY!\\The cost of parking is making me consider the train. the TRAIN!!!!\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll send you pics of the food :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't think you'd like it. Very soft crunchy\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: hmm, looks a bit healthy to me\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i'm also not a fan of sea bacon\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's basically raw fish cured in lemon and lime juice\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also what is sea bacon?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Octopus\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aaaaaaah\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That looks better :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Omg it was sooooo goood\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Glad you enjoyed it.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What are you getting up to?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Full rave. Sat watching a film (the draft) in my comfy clothes.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Are you still out and about?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh any good?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah still Oxford Street way. Would love to be snuggled up watching a film right about now\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Suprisingly given I know nothing about the NFL. The moment the NFL generates has to be insane. I seem to like the odd sports movie.\\
Oh you’re deep in London.\\There might be time for a snuggle tomorrow.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No might! There will definitely be time for a snuggle\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just on the tube to the car. Did you end up playing games?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No games, just watched TV.\\
That has been a long day for you. Have you had a good time?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you found out any more about lunch?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just about to drive home. Will text when I'm back x\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Home!\\
I am absolutely pooped and definitely aiming for a lay in tomorrow. It's been a big ol' day\\But yes, it was really lovely\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes and no :face-with-tears-of-joy: agi has had quite a bad week with some stuff so hasn't arranged anything but it should be when Andy goes to football tomorrow\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Glad your home safe and had a good time.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did you have a nice chilled evening?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was chilled, ended up making some popcorn as I had a hankering. Still easier than I remembered may have been slightly out of date.\\
Just got into bed. Bit knackered today.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you pottered straight to bed or is pottering required\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ooh nice. Love popcorn. And also the word hankering.\\
You've had a long day too. Lay in tomorrow?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Pottering always required. Feeding the beast who's giving me the stink eye for the lateness of dinner\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh that is late for the beast.\\
Bit of a lie in tomorrow. Will get breakfast and then I need to go to Morrisons for some food and fuel. I’ll grab the missing bits we need for dinner as well.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh don't worry, I will grab the bits for dinner :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Are you sure? I will be in the shop\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes of course :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: if there is anything you fancy, let me know\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll get pud too\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The selection thingy from last time was good.\\
You’ll have to remember the spice mix packet :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\Chicken is being defrosted and we have naan and the sauces from last time\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I already put the spice mix on the counter yesterday :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Oki I'll get the selection bits and poppadoms\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think the butter chicken needs some sort of yogurt as well.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup yup, I've got the list from the packet\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The real question is will it make it from the counter to the bag\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah, it will!!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll try my best\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well I’ll wish you good night while you potter about.\\
Looking forward to seeing you tomorrow. It’s been AGES x x x x x x x x x x x\\Love you :red-heart:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just about in bed.\\

I did sleep quite well. Woke up really early but managed to fall back asleep.\\Oh what's happening with the parking?\\I'm a bit hurty this morning from the week so will take it easy and go tomorrow morning.\\Did you sleep well? What are you up to today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Saw on Facebook that the pay machines for the car park and the app are all broken. So you have to pay in the lido.\\
Slept ok. Going to have a bit of breakfast then go to Morrisons for fuel and some shopping. Then want to do some robot stuff. Plus seeing you later :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\What are you up to? Pottering, lunch, nap, shower?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh boo that would have been such a hassle.\\
Sounds like a good day! Can't wait to squeeze you!\\Haha, how did you know? I'm becoming so predictable :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Pottering is where the mystery is. I don’t know what it is but I know you do it.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahahaha.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: <attached: 00016014-GIF-2024-04-27-09-26-10.mp4>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: very\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Are you sure you don’t want me to get the stuff from Morrisons? I can get what ever else you need as well if you want?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't worry bubs, I'll go just before heading to you. Thank you though :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Every time I go shopping I'm reminded why having it delivered it SOOOOOOO much better. The thing they want they dont have and you have to interact with PEOPLE who are just experiencing the outside, shopping, self services tills and other people for the first time in their life.\\
In an additional sad moment I realised it might have been cheaper in Lidl as well\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, Saturdays are horrendous for it. That's why I do food shop after work on a Monday. And the Lidl thought is most probably right.\\
Do you need me to pick up anything they didn't have?\\Oh and lunch is not happening so I've had a nap :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I'll send you a pic to see if they have more by the time you go.\\
Sounds like a lot of faff for no lunch. What does that mean for the timings for the day?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yea do. I might go Aldi or something.\\
Yeah it's not great. I'm giving this a pass this time because I know the week has been challenging for her but :face-with-rolling-eyes:\\What time will you be done with robot stuff?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: The robot stuff will never be done :face-with-tears-of-joy: but i'd like to try and give it a couple of hours and I've got some jobs to do so I can avoid judgment as I'm sure tomorrow will be a "nothing gets done day" but I really want to see you as well.\\
3:30?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Can we make it 4.30?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: yeah that works\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha thanks. Because I'm still laying around having Spuddly snuggles\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okie, will have a look :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Your paired answer was much better than mine.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I loved yours. I think we just did the meaning of staycation differently :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Do you have butter?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, got loads.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Brill!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you still roboting? I could come earlier if it works for you?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Haven’t even started :face-with-tears-of-joy: been doing jobs. Just got out of the shower. You can come over earlier.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. I can leave in 2 and do shop and then to you. Probs 4pm :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sounds good.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Shopping\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Obviously really enjoyed this evening. Just a lot of fun spending time with and cooking etc.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, me too. I love just hanging out with you and doing normal bits\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And very much enjoyed the "etc'"\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I enjoyed the etc as well.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done. That’s a lot of light have you got to love again to turn it all off.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No it's just my bedside lamp :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope you sleep well tonight.\\
Night night x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\Love you :red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hope you sleep well too. Really need an opportunity for you to get a couple of rounds in during sex and see how that helps with sleep and the new drugs. All for science obviously.\\
Night x x x x x x x x x x\\Love you :red-heart:\\P.s. I thought it might feel weird saying it out loud today but it really didn’t.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We will definitely try it out next time. For science of course.\\
\section*{Sunday $28\textsuperscript{th}$}
Yes, I was wondering how it would feel out loud. It felt very nice :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Morning x x x x x x x x\\
I think I hear it raining :man-facepalming:\\You up early?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
It's been raining so hard all night, woke me up about 4am. It's going to be so muddy for you :face-with-open-mouth:\\I'm going to try gym and then need to go into town for bits for school\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: And cold. This isn’t really what I signed up for.\\
I did wake up at 6 in a mild panic but had an extra hour.\\Enjoy the gym.\\I don’t know how much I’m going to have my phone today but will message when I can.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki, thank you.\\
Enjoy it as much as you can and please look after yourself and don't break yourself :growing-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Same to you in the gym :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: hopefully it will be much less muddy and slippery for me\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: \url{https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGe9o4apW/}\\
:eyes::eyes::eyes::eyes::eyes::eyes::eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I can get one printed\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :smiling-face-with-hearts::smiling-face-with-hearts::smiling-face-with-hearts::smiling-face-with-hearts::smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
Thank you\\Are you not on your way yet?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just picking Cally up now\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have a safe journey\\
Love you,:red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Finished an half dressed. Amount to go back for drink and snack. Full details later.\\
How’s you day been?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well done! Can't wait to hear about it and the half dressing. Enjoy drink and snack\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Home!\\
There is mud, in places! On the plus side I can feel most if not all of my body again. So that’s a bonus. I got more cold after I changed and we were sat with chips and a drink\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah welcome back. Tell me everything!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s kind of insane what we just did. The cold and the mud were mental. People saying it was colder than the winter ones they have done. Water levels higher than ever.\\
All of the water obstacles were brilliant. Super good fun. The river was fucking cold. The river swim is where I think my balls just left.\\No need for any ice baths.\\The crawling through a tube I noped out of including the craw through some tarp thing. A couple of the crawl things I did. The trick is to be on your back and just pull yourself through on the mud. Easy.\\The slide was horrific. I get a bit more of a speed boost than most. You go down head first arms out like superman. I couldn’t really see the end to guess when to hold my breath. Just about did it. Somehow banged my shoulder and knee so only did it the once. A few others did it twice.\\Last 500m had 3 obstacles :man-facepalming:\\Nearly kicked a guy in the head on the a frame as he just wasn’t looking or thinking.\\At the end they get you to jump into a mud pool. It was the muddest we all got the whole thing.\\First few km were good. Lots of people and things. Seemed to take an age to get to 5km then all of a sudden it’s 7km but the last bit was a slog. The 5km route would be super fun but I’m not sure obstacles you miss.\\Thinking about it it all happens quite fast. You don’t really think what you’ve done.\\New shoes worked brilliantly. Super high grip. Some people were in trainers! Nearly dead from slipping everywhere.\\3 hours in total.\\Had to have a cold shower after. They have hose things all in a line. Just to try and get the mud off. Washing machine is running already and I’m about to shower my shoes.\\Really good to do it as a group. Would be less fun as a couple of only 3-4 people. Well paced runs as well.\\Just didn’t really expect it to take 3 hours.\\Going to shower now and get food. Once I sit I think I’m done.\\What have you got up to today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Friday - not sure when your leaving but we have been invited to my parents at some point in the day for tea and puppy.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: This sounds brilliant. I'm so glad you had a good time!\\
Will there be photos? Did everyone survive? What did you do after?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh we'll be going before\/at lunch I think. Not sure about the plan yet\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I would have loved to see the pup\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: There will be photos somehow. We all survived. Some people were very cold throughout. I got lucky I was really only cold after getting changed. I did have to run a  bit to keep the heart rate up.\\
We just grabbed a bit of food (just chips) and an overpriced hot chocolate.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully your shoulder and knee don't hurt\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Car park was a disaster. Total mud fest at the end. Just about got the car out but that is now covered in mud as well.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I can imagine!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you having a proper dinner now?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Once I’ve showered. I don’t know how proper it will be. Need to find something hot then it will be a mix of everything I have left over. Full snack dinner\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Snacky bits! Yes!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How was the gym and shopping?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Gym was good but I almost folded under a squat set :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:.\\
Hated being in town as usual so was in and out in an hour. Popped to see Nicky's new flat after then nap then wrapped all the biccies and stuff for work, wrote out thank you cards and now just threw in laundry\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was shower?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Took forever to clean my shoes :face-with-tears-of-joy: otherwise a good shower. Sharpie does not come off easy.\\
Is Rebecca dropping off brownies to me tomorrow?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I bet! Hopefully you'll warmed up now.\\
Yes, should be with you around 9. Is that okay?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That works. I assume you’ve given her my address. Are you going to pick them up after your work drinks or do you want me to drop off once you get home?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I can swing by on my way back of that's okay? Do you have anything on tomorrow night?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Can I give her your number too?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I don’t appear to. My brain is a bit broken with what I do and don’t have on at the moment.\\
For Wednesday I now have Hannah at 4pm instead of Friday. So I could come to you before that to say hello? Isn’t Wednesday the day you also wanted to have sex under a cherry tree?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: A kiss! I wanted a kiss under a cherry tree :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I knew it was something :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:, gotta try my luck.\\
For that then did you want to come over before your massage\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha\\
Yeah I could come over and bring breakfast?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sounds good.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh btw, had a phone call with mother :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: As expected she waited all this time to ask me half way through the call about our photo :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh. What did she say about the photo?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Said she zoomed in three times to ascertain if you were nice and then went through my whole Facebook because she remembered seeing you somewhere else :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Is it the 3 zooms specifically that mean I’m nice or that just how many times it took.\\
Then after she has cyber stalked me what has she said or I guess more importantly what did you say?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: At least I know who it is when I get a new friend recommendation on book face.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You definitely won't because A) she doesn't speak English and B) she's so technophobic that she was too scared to like that photo in case she did something else :face-with-rolling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm not sure what the 3 zooms were about :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
She cyberstalked me!\\I said that you are very lovely and I am happy\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s good. Was the news received positively?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Of course it was!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You never know with these things and I can’t claim to understand the relationship you have with your mum.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know. I promise I'll tell you about it at some point. It's very complicated\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know and I’m pleased I was received well\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I always receive you well :winking-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, yes you do.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: \url{https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.teamup.teamup}\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How about this for shared calendar?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: We could just use a google or Microsoft calendar?\\
I’d then probably nerd something to copy events in and out of the calendar I use.\\Not sure it needs a whole different app\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah Oki. How do we do that?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I was just thinking because I'm android and you're iPhone we might not be able to sinc them\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Needs more research but definitely a solvable problem as I have 3 different calendars I can access on my phone although I really only use one.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. Just let me know what to do :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Will have to get the brain juices flowing. I know I’ve solved this problem in the past with clients.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh absolutely no rush for tonight\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: In bed, tucked in in preparation for my last Monday\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How are you feeling?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh well done. I think I might go to bed soon as well.\\
Only 2  more days :grinning-squinting-face:\\Legs are sore but not crazy bad. Surprisingly horney.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Surprisingly?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Maybe you could replay some lovely memories from last night in your mind in my absence... Maybe I should have taken that toy home :winking-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Suprising for me at least. Been pretty horny the last 3 days.\\
That will be what I have to do.\\You’ve got your own toys (apparently). I want to see what effect it has on your first. I’d miss out if I’m not there.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well I wish I could help!\\
That's very true. We do need to try it out\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yes it does need testing. I’d though we might try it on Saturday but you attacked me as I stepped out of my office :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Attacked????\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I distinctly remember you enjoyed yourself\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh yeah. I very much enjoyed myself\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I didn’t say attacked in a bad way\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Right. Nighty night.x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x Hope you sleep well and don't hurt too much tomorrow.\\
Love you :red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night x x x x x x x x\\
\section*{Monday $29\textsuperscript{th}$}
Hope you sleep well. Enjoy your last Monday.\\I’ve just made it to bed as well. Knees are knackered\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00016131-GIF-2024-04-29-06-07-40.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x x\\
Oh that's not good, hopefully you managed to get some rest\\How are you feeling?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Knees and right ankle are a bit sore but otherwise pretty good.\\
How are you feeling? In general and  about today.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm tired and achy but I think it's the stress. And I'm starting to feel anxious, I think it's finally dawning on me that it's the last two days\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It will be the stress \/ anxiety. Not sure knowing that helps.\\
All you can actually do is just enjoy the last 2 days as best you can. People will say nice things and you have a whole bunch of new people looking forward to you working with them next week.\\The reality is that the decision was made weeks ago and now you just have to sit back as it plays out.\\Just imagine, in 2 weeks time this could be the time your alarm goes off and you won’t have work hours need to do in the evenings or at the weekend\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think it's helpful to know, at least I can mitigate it a tiny little bit.\\
You are right and I'm going to try my best to enjoy it\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I survived spin :weary-face:\\
Somewhat surprised by the body. Managed to push it like a normal spin class.\\Enjoy the day. I’ll be getting the brownies at some point. I’ll let you know once I have them.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Wooo hoo, well done. Please rest before Hannah - you're having a very full on fitness day after yesterday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Don’t worry. Full on sitting before Hannah. Probably a lot of sitting after as well.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, what's the plan for rest of the day?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Might skip spin tomorrow as a rest day then do shit spin Thursday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I need to do some work and some robot stuff but will see after lunch what the brain can do\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That is a very good idea\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sensible plan, well done\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m nothing if not sensible :man-facepalming:\\
How many lessons have you get left today?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 2 but last one with my crappy one first thing\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: At least that gets it over with.\\
Consultant question for you.\\The shared calendar idea.\\What problem are we trying to solve?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00016148-GIF-2024-04-29-09-40-14.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope session with Hannah was good.\\
Just got a call that Ofsted is coming tomorrow. FML\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't be tempted!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: They are now being held hostage :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am so stressed\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: About? OFSTED?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm the only person from the dept teaching tomorrow, everyone else is doing exams\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: So they will definitely come to me\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m not sure I have a very biased view to give you as I have had more weeks of my life ruined by OFSTED than most given I’m not even a teacher.\\
While I agree with the sentiment of what OFSTED is meant to do. Which I believe is to see how a school could be made better and then help the school resolve those issues, what it actually does is make people do work they never do to create some false picture all to try and maintain budgets.\\Given it’s you last day my view would very very much be that you just do a normal day.\\I’m pretty sure you won’t but you don’t owe anyone anything.\\If it hasn’t already getting any more stressed about anything is just going to cause you pain.\\It’s not your problem everyone else knows the department is doing exams. That is the schools problem. If they view your class. So what. You’re a good teacher. If they do view your class tell them it’s your last day.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you :red-heart:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You’re still going to stress about though?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: A bit, definitely\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: There's an after school meeting and all\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: This is partly why it the whole thing really fucks me off.\\
So now what. Every teacher is going to be briefed on the false impression they need to prepare for tomorrow. Adding stress to everyone. Ruining everyone evening at minimum but whole week most likely.\\Fuck that.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes exactly\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not that it helps. It’s just dumb.\\
They should just turn up on a day. Spot check what they want or can. Then come back a week later to meet with leadership and work out how everyone can help everyone make it all better.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That would be a much better way of doing things\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s literally how every other sector does things\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well that would make too much sense and we don't do that in education\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Either way, none of it is your problem now. It’s the schools problem. And you don’t need to feel guilty for that either.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00016171-VIDEO-2024-04-29-12-34-23.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly, it's like no good deed goes unpunished\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aw she's living the life\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is true. That why you do sometimes have to be selfish.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Are the classes you have tomorrow with good groups? Behaviour wise?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's only my little ones tomorrow which is good and bad. They work hard (some) but there's too many of them. And I'm doing two computer lessons :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: I'm not cancelling those and planning some brand new stuff\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just teach it all as normal and they will see what they see. You don’t need to hurt yourself over any of it.\\
Rule \#1\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, my head is getting there. Just needed to freak out first :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No, stop it :stop-sign:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No freak out needed\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've already done it :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Nothing to freak out about out\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well at least it’s done\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm calming down now\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You helped. As per usual :red-heart:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: CALM DOWN :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But had to cancel my after school drinks\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It always helped to calm down when it’s yelled :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy: not\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :man-facepalming: or is cancelling drinks a good thing overall?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just take the bloody compliment\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No I did want to see people and say goodbye\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Can you not just go after the meeting? At least everyone will be there.\\
I guess half will be in tears and racing home to fake paperwork\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nah I do need to tie up some bits for tomorrow. But it won't be a late one\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll text when I'm leaving\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hmmmm\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Printing and stuff\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok, any guess on the time?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not before X type thing\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Maybe leaving here 4.30 - 5.00\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Only because my brain doesn’t do well when people say “I’ll come over later”\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Same. Don't worry\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Does this work?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah that fine. I’m not going anywhere\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope work goes well\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: We will see. Need lunch first and my 4th shower in 24 hours\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy: enjoy\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll be leaving in about 10. I  yukky just to warn you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: ok, see you in a bit. To warn you, I'm in comfy clothes\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: All fed and watered.\\
How's your evening going?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I lost 40 minutes somewhere.\\
Think I made a mistake on the very little amount of works I’ve done but also think I now have a direction for it.\\Just finished dinner. I think games next but will see.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: How are you doing now?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's hard work. Mistakes are expected. But good progress on the direction.\\
Definitely do something to switch off that wonderful brain of yours.\\How's Matt doing?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Absolutely pooped. Took drugs and will go lay down with book I think\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think Matt’s doing Matt. Although I think he did he self destruction and now back to normal. Funeral is next week or week after. It will be good to get that done but he is such an idiot for not pushing the house sale through.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Everyone deals with hard stuff differently. As you know I can be a very freeze in the moment type of person sometimes too\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Great plan, as hard as it is you need to try and limit your level of caring for tomorrow. Maybe some sort of level of disassociation. Not sure how to do it but work (generic) will squeeze every last thing out of you because work doesn’t care.\\
Stick with the big picture thinking.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to try but it will be hard. When you're at school you get so swept up in everything\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s super easy to get swept up. Especially because you care and you like your students and your colleagues. They all benefit from you going above and beyond.\\
If the school management told OFSTED to do what they should then that would be all be better.\\The only silver lining is this proving why your doing what your doing.\\Today is the most broken  I’d seen you in a while.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I honestly feel so broken today - definitely not have had this for a long while, maybe even since I've been signed off.\\
I just want to be better and the new job must be easier\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It shows how quickly your brain converts stress to pain.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh so quickly. I literally felt it spread through the day and by the end I was barely walking\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The terrible plan that could help that is to find ways to not care about things.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You know that's not me. I care a lot about things\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know. I did say it’s a terrible plan.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm falling asleep reading so I'm going to say night night now x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x hope you sleep well and enjoy the lay in tomorrow.\\
Love you :red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night x x x x x x x\\
Hope you sleep well.\\Try not to worry. None of it is your stuff to worry about anymore.\\Love you :red-heart:\\I’m not doing spin tomorrow so not sure when I’ll be up.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Don’t forget cakes\\

You’d have to ask that question to the leadership team”\\“I’m not entirely sure of the most up to date process for this but I would check on it here (say where to find) and then follow the steps”\\“I have a chronic condition and I know my memory isn’t the best so I think it’s this (what ever) but I would double check first before acting”\\Or my favourite phrase for the day.\\“It’s my last day. Ask someone else”\\Even I’m too professional to actually tell someone to fuck off.\\Remember, just think. “What would Paul do?” Then remove the swearing\\You got this. Fuck OFSTED\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00016232-GIF-2024-04-30-07-48-49.mp4>\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: God I love you :red-heart:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Aww.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
Thank you for this.\\Y13s are already in my room decorating :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\I've just been told I have to go to that ect mentor meeting with the inspectors after school so will be a late one.\\What are you up to today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I would be very half seriously telling them to professionally jump off the nearest high bridge for that after school meeting. Refer to above phrases :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
There is no benefit to you at all and it’s not like your around for follow up questions later in the week.\\If you must go I certainly wouldn’t worry or put extra effort in.\\I know a bang on about trying to care less at work and it’s not that I think people shouldn’t care about their job or take pride in their work. It’s about the right balance.\\I’ve ruined enough holidays, evening and weekends doing that little bit extra or going the extra mile to help a customer or a colleague or the company.\\Looking back all it really got me a lot of was extra work because I was the go to guy for stuff, the customer got stuff for free or I simply wasted my time not getting paid on something that could have waited. Then when the end of year rolls around. I got a lot of “well done” “great work” but there’s no money for a pay rise or sorry you didn’t do X (which I normally had done) so no bonus.\\That’s why I think I’m much more tempered with what level of effort work gets.\\Today will be work and robot. Going to try the assignment question. At least get something on the page. There isn’t any math so it’s just all writing. The question isn’t graded so I just need to have a good attempt.\\Then start the next case study reading thing.\\Want to see if I can get robot responding to the phone today. Either it’s nearly done or completely broken.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Let me know if you want to drop in your way back to celebrate unemployment or I could pop round to you.\\
Or you can just go back to cry and squeeze the cat.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I do have to go to the meeting but I'm not really fussed about it. It's just so ironically funny that I'm fully in it till the very last minute .\\
Sending you all the productivity vibes and hope the robot works\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I will do. Hopefully I am not completely absolutely knackered\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Does spud like balloons?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00016243-GIF-2024-04-30-09-01-56.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Very much. I once got one like this for birthday the first year I had him. Left it in the living room and woke up to it by my bed in the morning :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: This is how it feels. And literally everyone is like "what a way to leave"\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Maybe the best way to do it. You get to remember the crazy your leaving\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's just a shame I won't get to say proper goodbyes as everyone is mentally running around\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah that is a real shame. Maybe you can arrange the after drinks for a few weeks time.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's what I was thinking :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Almost afraid to ask but are you surviving?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Surviving :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: how's your day going?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done.\\
Going ok. About an hour later than I’d like it to be. Just about to cook lunch. I have produced some spectacular bullshit of a write up to my assignment question.\\Can’t be too long left to survive now.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm just leaving.\\
Can I pop by for a cuddle...even though I'm yukky?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: sure, see you in a bit\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I went home through Downley \#sobrave\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So brave. Well done.\\
\#newyou.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha, thank you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What are you up to tonight? I forgot to ask\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well you were itching to escape :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Just having food then will be doing some robot stuff. Not sure how it’s 7pm already.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I wasn't!!!!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I thought you had work\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: There is always work.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sorry!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It completely fine. You wanted food and needed to unpack and start to decompress\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :smiling-face-with-hearts::smiling-face-with-hearts::smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh nice.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It looks so simple but she put so much taste into it. What are you having?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I had a chilli that I made a while ago. Working my way through the freezer.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I need to do that!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I got some thought from Hannah and a calculation she did says I should be trying for 250g protein a day!\\
So I need some 100g ish protein meals to try and batch out.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Omg that's soooo much!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I struggle with hitting my protein\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah it’s a lot. Needs some lunch that I think is 2 tins tuna with eggs plus something.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh wow!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm sure we'll be able to figure out some good meals\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You’ve clearly made a positive impact. You can be proud of that.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Wow, I count 8 boxes of chocolates\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha pretty much. And a massive banana cake\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, best teacher squared\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy: nerd\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: God I'm so emotional\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
I think I said before but it is a real shame that you only find out this sort of stuff at the end.\\This is a nice way to move forward though. It’s great knowing you’ll be missed and better knowing that both teachers and students liked and valued what you did.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It is. Honestly I felt so loved yesterday and today, by everyone. You don't realise the impact you're having in the moment and then stuff like this hits you like a train\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: All tucked in and ready to get some alarm free unemployed sleep :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did you have a good evening?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No alarm at all?\\
Been a fast evening. I have forgotten just how painful string manipulation is in code. Doesn't matter what language. It is just pain\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well... 8am one so basically none :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Oh were you working late?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: its robot stuff. So not quite working\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: plus the code isn't working :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aaah oki.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What needs to be done?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: needs to work\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh really :face-with-rolling-eyes::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: When I send a command from the phone I get unwanted crap at the start and end of the string\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: so I need to strop that out before processing the string\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: strip\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I wish I could help\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: one of the problems I have is I cannot replicate the string in a test because it uses ' and \\ charaters which get interpreted funny\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: so not only does the code not work by test code doesn't work for a different reason\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: by = my\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well that sounds complicated. Hopefully you'll figure it out\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: hopefully. As always this isn't even the bit I want to be fixing but I need this to work so that I can send commands to the robot\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Of course. Fix stuff before you can fix stuff\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: the fact that I have your old phone bluetoothed to my robot is somewhat mental and I can send and receive data between the 2. Just not well\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That is impressive\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You clever clogs. You'll figure it out\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i'll find a way\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You always do\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to try to get some less anxious sleep\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: why only less\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: should be non anxious now\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well yes .\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: its all done now. Nothing to be anxious about\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just the new job :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But no point worrying about it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: even what that. You have your timetable which looks nice and simple. Its all just learning and asking question and talking to some new people. No one is going to be trying to catch you out\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: my typing today :man-shrugging:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know. Just new chapter in life. However good it is it's still a bit scary\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: replace scary with exciting. They are the same feeling\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki I will :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: good things come at the edge of discomfort\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh you wise one :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: at least you didn't say old\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaahha\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I'll wish you good night and i'll see if I can get some code to work.\\
Well done on your last day.\\A new chapter awaits\\x x x x x x x x x x x x\\LOVE YOU :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night. x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\

Hope your code works and you get some good sleep.\\I'll see you in the morning.\\LOVE YOU :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00016334-GIF-2024-05-01-07-52-58.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x x\\
I woke up at 5.30 in panic that I overslept :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\You're up early too\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: 5:30 wouldn’t even be that bad would it?\\
Yeah, went to sleep late and then up early. Brain was all over the place yesterday and this morning I have no idea. It’s starting to get warm.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No it wouldn't but obviously my brain is still very much in work mode.\\
Is it the code\/work or something else?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Mainly code and work mixed in with my current fitness level.\\
You need to tell the brain shhh. It’s an early half term. Work mode is next week and it starts later in the day.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What do you mean with current fitness level?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just that we are 12 weeks into the year and I’m not as fast, strong or light as I was at the start and progress is either very slow in some areas or going completely the wrong way.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We might be, but also remember you had almost two months off between US and recovery. And you have been working hard all the other times. It's not like you're skipping classes\/sessions and lounging around. Sometimes progress plateaus and then gets moving. I know it can get frustrating, I definitely get frustrated with my progress or lack of.\\
I am more than happy to sit down and have a look at things with you or look into some high protein food choices etc. any help I can give\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thank you.\\
The 2 months really didn’t help but that’s done now.\\Just all so frustratingly slow. I think stuff will click better once uni is over.\\You still in for 9am\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup just jumping in the shower and hoping to leave here at 9. Will text\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Spare flat keys. For both doors.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Omg of course!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Omg :frowning-face-with-open-mouth: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just leaving\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Dont forget to pick up drugs\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just on my way\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Apparently there is a national shortage of my evening meds\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :man-facepalming:\\
What does that mean?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I need to speak to the prescribing nurse this afternoon for an alternative.... But I'm going to have withdrawal side effects and new med side effects\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well that all sucks. How many do you have left?\\
So not really a shortage more of a none available at all.\\I know there is similar with ADHD meds. Can you phone around and see if other places have them?\\What’s the name?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Stupid question. Are the evening meds still needed now you have the morning ones?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I have a week left ( including the ones in the handbag case). I thought I was so well organised, ordering them on Monday :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Yeah none available. I will need a new prescription but I'll try after I see what the nurse says.\\It's nortriptyline\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I do. They kind of work together, one on top of another\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you explicitly asked the people behind the counter if there are any at another pharmacy?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes I have\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: At least you found out now. That is beyond a pain.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm really hoping there will be a solution\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: When are you speaking to a nurse? I’m assuming you’ll need a doctor for a new prescription?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: So the prescribing nurse can do prescriptions. They reopen at 2 so will call then\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok, you might have to become that arsehole customer who keeps going on and on until something gets done.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I will\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s in stock here\\
\url{https://www.speedsmedical.co.uk/nortriptyline-10mg-tablets-100-tablet-s.html}\\So someone can get some somehow.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: There might be the same med under a different name available which I'm hoping is the case\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And here\\
\url{https://www.dockpharmacy.com/product/nortriptyline-10mg-tabs-100/}\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh maybe boots or super drug will have it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Phone everyone :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Seems like they are available on some online stores. I have no idea how that works with the prescription. Need the big computer\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I don't know either to be honest\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Will call after the GP. They might have an in somewhere\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00016375-GIF-2024-05-01-13-22-45.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's work going?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s hard.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Interesting but hard. Learning how we can work out the rotation speed of a star based on the Doppler shift of the light that comes off the star as it spins.\\
Which is a stupid crazy concept on its own given when you look at a star it’s a tiny point of light.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sending you all the learning and productivity vibes! You can do it!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: <attached: 00016381-GIF-2024-05-01-13-26-09.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you :red-heart:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Meter man is here\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: that's good at least. Have you spoke to nurse?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No because he's been here since 2\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: isn't he just in the hall way thingy just installing a meter\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No because we've been trying to figure out how to switch my power off because my fuse box is apparently a little unusual :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And I don't want to be on the phone in case he finishes\/needs something\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I get that but I think you just need to do it. Don't need the risk of someone on the other end finishing early and not being available. You dont have Friday to do anything and it starts to cut things real fine if it all slips to monday\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll do it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Or phone Boots in Marlow \/ Beacosnfield to see if they can fill the prescription you already have\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: as getting what you already use has to be the quickest before changing brands etc\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't have the prescription because I was only given IOU from the pharmacy\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hence needing a new one\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: but a prescription must exist for the pharmacy to not be able to give it to you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It did. But it had both my meds on it and because they dispensed one med I can't use it anymore\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: well that all seems unnecessarily complicated for everyone\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well it is what it is\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: back to plan A then but from the screen shot you can see what tablet sizes are in theory available at boots\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I appreciate you having a look for them\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know how much pain Cally and Becky have had trying to find ADHD drugs so I know its not a super quick problem to solve. Added with the NHS being slow and people in general not caring about things. Plus the hold time every time you make a phone call.\\
And I don't like problems\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know you don't.\\
I only need the oral tablet 10mg so they should have it in Eden and could pick it up when I have a new prescription\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: when you talk to whoever see if they can get you a 2 month supply.\\
My mind is screaming to get this fixed.\\If you can get the prescription I can always pick up from eden if you need\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you :red-heart: I know you want to help. And I'll get it fixed - concentrate on your work. I feel bad for distracting you again\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Dont feel bad. Just phone everyone that needs to be phoned\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I will\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well I need to call back tomorrow afternoon and something should be done about it :upside-down-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hmmm, upsettingly vague.\\
Meter man done?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup all done. Had to change some bits so took longer. Just waiting for the meter to sync up and all.\\
How's work?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s good. Something crossed off the list.\\
Made progress with work, just a hard concept. Not got as far as I would have liked but that’s normal. Will just keep going tomorrow.\\Just finished my session with Hannah. Arms dead.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well done on making progress, that's the important bit, not how fast you got there.\\
I've ended up going for the walk with Jenny. Just about to head back home.\\How was the session except not owning arms anymore?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Other than now having working arms the session was good.\\
I do feel delicate today though.\\Just about to head off to Duncan’s for robot chat.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Delicate how?\\
Enjoy your nerd time :beaming-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just feeling sluggish and achy\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You've done a lot of exercise in the last 4 days\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope you had a nice and productive evening\\
Night night x x x x x x x\\Love you :red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night x x x x x x x x x\\
\section*{Thursday $02\textsuperscript{nd}$}
Was a nice evening. Longer than expect but good.\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Morning x x x x x x x x\\
Been a while since I’ve  heard thunder.\\Did you wake up in a panic again or just thunder?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x\\
I think just the storming woke me up.\\You got home late. Did you sleep well?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah it was a late night. Slept ok just not very long. I can have a lie in tomorrow.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What are you up to today?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm meeting Katie for a coffee this morning, then hair, then therapy. And then I need to sort stuff for Brighton and pack bits. How about you?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That was it. I knew you had a busy day. Plus harassing people for drugs.\\
Got my shit spin class then want to finish of the astrophysics for the week.\\Got my robot club call this evening. Hoping for a bit of time in between. Will go for a walk if it’s nice enough.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes yes, harassing people for drugs.\\
You've got a few things going on today too!\\What fun things did you get up to with Duncan?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Definitely yes yes on the harassing. You don’t need to be suffering any more than normal because other people can’t be arsed to do something or because the system is shit.\\
Lots of interesting chats with Duncan and Andrea (guy from Malta). Duncan’s new mini robot has made progress.\\Andrea and Duncan talked a whole bunch about stuff I have no clue about as they are both electronic super nerds.\\Had a little demo on my robot to get some idea why it drives like a drunk old person. Was cool to send it commands from the phone to make it work. Some other chats about making a spinning laser sensor. Went through how Duncan’s club do their walk following robots and logic. Bit of Mega con stuff.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: From Paired you really haven’t don’t that many holidays then.\\
I had a little look the other day when you said. Some sort of all inclusive something in November is around the £1100 mark. Each.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh sounds like you had a nerdtastic evening! Glad you had fun\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No I haven't really done many holidays.\\
Oof that's a bit pricey. Where we you looking?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That looks good\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was spin?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Only looked at some holiday site. Wasn’t a real deep dive or anything. Just was trying to get a feel for destinations and prices.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was one of the better least shit ones for a while. Had 6 of us as well so that helps.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh at least that\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you seen katy or is that later?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup, just got home. Might have a quick half an hour nap before heading to get the hair done\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sounds like a good idea\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So busy being unemployed :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha isn't it just\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy: don't threaten me with a good time\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Hair done?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup. Just on my way home. How's uni work?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Pics!\\
Urgh, it’s ok. Struggling to see why they are making us do this but if work and the assignment question for this section is super long.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You can do it!!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Are you taking your pic for JJ? When therapy? <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I will at some point today.\\
I had a voicemail while I was at the hairdresser that apparently therapy appt needs postponing and she'll call me later to rearrange\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: :man-facepalming: that’s a pain. You get all psyched up for it and then it changes\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah but what can I do\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: There where the annoyance comes from I guess.\\
Have you got to phone back to harass for drugs?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Will be calling after 2\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's with the pharmacist and they are dealing with it. I will get a call back :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did they say when or what “dealing with it means”\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Of course not, I didn't get past the receptionist. I'm assuming either sourcing the medication or getting me a new prescription\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’d phone back and get more info. WTF is the receptionist going to know.\\
It actually the thing you’d tell a client when fuck all has been done.\\“Oh yeah, he’s dealing with it”\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The note on my file says it is with the pharmacist. I asked for her to be contacted for info, they are contacting her and giving me a call back when they have more info. I've been dealing with these things for years so I do have an idea what to do\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know you know what to do. I just dont have a lot of confident in people doing stuff when they aren't being pushed to do it. Certainly when it feels like what they needed to do was just re-issue you a bit of paper so you could go somewhere else.\\
Your away tomorrow. Monday is a bank holiday and you start a new job on Wednesday\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know I am. I'll call back if I don't hear. And can always pop in tomorrow morning. It will get sorted, it has to.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I'm sure your a bit used to it but this is all quite new to me and it was frustrating enough with the tests I had last year. Inefficiencies really bug me.\\
It probably all come across really wrong but this is me really caring.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know it is new to you bubs and I really do appreciate you caring about it all. I just got a little overwhelmed because I am doing everything I can to sort this\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I have been faffing around with the j\&j photos too long. Please help\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Too many clothes :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: 2nd or 4th\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Definitely not first\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Why? Do I look deranged?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Terrified\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I hate photos of myself\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Maybe the 4th is most professional. 2nd has a little whimsy\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I like 2nd\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sold\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I mean these are the 4 out of like 30\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: All very corporate. Well done.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yay, progress\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll need to go tomorrow morning I guess\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Can I pick them up? But I don’t want that to create more faff\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think you should be able to but I don't want to put extra bits on you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I don’t mind picking them up if it helps\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Do you know what time your leaving\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Katie is picking me up at 10.30\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Chance for a good lie in then\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll try going to the pharmacy first thing\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok, let me know if you need any help. (With the drugs)\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I came up with a great announcement yesterday. Use that\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Which was?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well I don’t know now.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hold on\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Harro\\
Looking forward to meeting and working with you all.\\For the last X years I have been a secondary school language teacher and am Joint JJ for a change in careers.\\Prior to be a teacher I have worked with nuclear energy and <insert something else>.\\Original born in Slovakia but have lived in the uk for the past X years but also lived in France and X.\\Teaching didn’t leave a lot of room for free time but when I can I like to lift heavy things in the gym, run with a local club and partake in parkrun, crochet including a recent <some word) into making stuffed animals, love cooking, obsessed with murder and serial killers. So don’t try and kill me as I know how to stop you. Really into any sort of witchy shit.\\I live with my 3 year old cat Spud (attach picture) who gives me death stares if he gets fed late.\\Obviously needs some editing :red-heart:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::red-heart:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Brilliant\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your day been? When is your nerd call?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Nerd call is at 8. Days been ok\\
Got through the work but was a slog. Will have to do the assignment question tomorrow.\\It was a lot of busy work and they have made the whole idea of being a profession astrophysics seem really dull and depressing. That’s beyond the dull and depressing a man on the street might already assume.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I guess there's a lot of busy work, reading and writing involved in academia.\\
But good that you got through it all!\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Could I get something redelivered to your place please?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: sure, what are you sending me\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: My friend made me a necklace and they tried delivering but it's signed for\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And I won't be in on Tuesday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: no problem. Where are you Tuesday?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Actually apparently I can't get it redelivered to you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: At work\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh right :man-facepalming: I thought you were starting on Wednesday for some reason\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Had to get it redelivered to west Wycombe post office\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: at least you'll know where it is\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I might be able to pick it up if I have the slip thingy\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's not until Tuesday, I'll have to see whether I can get there after work\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I figured how to share my calendar with you. What email do you use for your calendar?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: paul-buzzby@hotmail.com\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ii haven't received anything yet?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I did send it through - or at least added you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have a look if it appears in your calendar\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Google calendar app?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: that's not the email address i sent you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's weird that it changed it to Gmail as I did put in the email you sent\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i do have that account\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Bizarre\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: ok, i'll take a look later\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No rush\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope robot call is good\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night. Hope you sleep well x x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
Love you :red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That was a surprisingly long meeting. Always gives stuff to think about.\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x x\\
Just trying to frantically pack :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\Did you sleep well?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Is this your first overnight trip in a while?\\
You do know that you don’t actually need to pack 18 pairs of pants and 7 outfits :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\You actually only need tonight’s outfit and new comfy clothes for tomorrow\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Seemed to sleep real fast. I either woke up and day dreamed or woke while dreaming about how to make new maze walls :man-facepalming: such a nerd\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Such a nerd :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Did you figure it out?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think so. I’ll have to try. I should be able to make some.\\
We aren’t going to print them anymore because the resin isn’t very reflective. So going to make them out of melamine lines MDF. Ideally a table saw sorts it out but I should be able to make a few for testing for the circular saw and band saw I have.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s certainly the cheaper option for the group\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And I won’t be making them\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh cool! You'll be back in your workshop!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, one of the many items on my todo list for after exams\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You'll be so busy after exams!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I really don’t have time for all this work stuff. It really gets in the way\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Why I really don’t understand some people you hear about who go back to work because they got bored.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well not everyone is as handy as you!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: True but you don’t have to be handy in order to have things you want to do. A shocking number of people really don’t seem to have hobbies or even things they enjoy.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How many more outfits have you got left to pack?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Also I will need a picture of the chosen outfit\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::face-with-rolling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I shall get some pictures later when we're there\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well yes. I wasn’t expecting them now\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The weather is so weird. I don't know it's going to be reasonably warm, rain, storm, or what\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Do you know when it all starts? I think you should be in Brighton quite early.\\
Is it inside or outside concert?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Could just to sun dress coat and scarf\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: So we just found out it's part of a weekend festival. It's all outside, should be in about 6. Will get lunch on the way and we can check in from 3\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I'd be too cold. Either black jeans or leather trousers and a top\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Or more realistic skirt leggings like you wore on our second date (the bowling one) top, jumper coat\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Leather trousers :flushed-face::eyes::eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I do not remember what I wore :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good or bad?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: They could get too hot maybe?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's supposed to be 12 degrees\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So you’re defo outside. Comfy boots!!!!!!!\\
Jeans, top, scarf, jumper and coat or so many people will keep it warm.\\Critical thing even if your outside is if there is a roof\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: 12 - super warm.\\
Wolf run was 6 and I was in shorts\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I'm not going for that kind of activity :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going for a more relaxed vibe. Trousers of some sort, either tshir or top and jumper and my leather jacket (and my blanket scarf)\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Maybe just go with the slightly smarter equivalent of what ever you wore on your walk with Jenny or Katie the other day\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sounds like a good idea.\\
Save the sun dress for when I’m around\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's all packed now so whatever it is I'll have that :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Even better thinking\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I shall do that. Will need sun for it though\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Booo, ruins that plan until August then :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully not\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Definitely bored of all the rain now. Only plus side is that the ground should still be soft for my run tomorrow\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you packed all your drugs for tomorrow as well\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not yet. I still have to take them\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Woo hoo. Well done. That’s a relief.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Time to reorder :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: There's 56 in there so at least more than one month\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I was thinking. Do you fancy steak for dinner tomorrow?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s a weird supply number but at least you’ve got nearly 2 months worth.\\
Oh that’s a good idea\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They usually do 28 so double dose\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Which one is the one you like from Lidl\/Aldi?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s the Lidl grass fed 10oz rib eye. That one seems to be the best.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki, I'll get some tomorrow. Anything else with it?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sauce?\\
I have chips\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki, I'll see what they have\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hmm thought that would just send the pic\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: If sent both pics on my mum previously\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Plus any interesting looking pudding\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What are you up to today?\\
Have you tried the calendar?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just about to leave to see my parents and puppy. Then will see what work I can do.\\
Not looked at the calendar yet but will do.\\I’m thinking of trying out some automation for to copy events from each of our calendars to the other\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ooh say hello for me please\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: To my parents or the puppy :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Both please\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Gimme fooooooood\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you made it to Brighton yet?\\
I might have some food options for you next week. I messed up and don’t cancel that dinner eats thing so now have some random selection arriving next week :man-facepalming:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes we did. Just stopped by in Rottingdean for some lunch.\\
How are parentals?\\Oh, the simmer thing?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah the simmer thing.\\
Parents are good. Could do with out the rain.  Both dogs super soggy.\\Seem to have made a bit of progress with my Nan. She now has morphine to take. Which surprise surprise works quite a lot better than the half dose of paracetamol she might take. She reads all the side effects mixed that with 40 year old ideas and some out of context daily mail article to justify not taking painkiller then complaining what she does take doesn’t work.\\Old people !!\\My parents have to new neighbours and have had their hall way painted. Might now mean the stairs carpet gets changed after 35 years. We will see. Helped Dad but a mirror back on the wall.\\Now going to attempt some work before I check on the little monster.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh cool, I'll take some off your hands if need be.\\
I'm glad there's progress with nan. But completely get the thinking, mine's the same.\\You've been productive, well done.\\We just got to the Airbnb\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: THE SEA!\\
Dad was smarter this time round and removed all the paper work from the box so she didn't have anything to read about the drug side effects. No doubt morphine has some warning that too much may result in death which would have ended all of that.\\Hope the Airbnb is nice and that you have a good time. I'll send you a spud update once I see him but otherwise i'll let you enjoy being out.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh well done Phil!\\
The Airbnb is sooo cute. The bedroom wallpaper is like dark blue with gold and I'm definitely thinking about it in dark green and gold for mine :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\How's work gone?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: green and gold would look cool. Just the back wall or the whole thing?\\
I can never get into a flow with these assignment questions. They feel like a lot of work for the answer you then get or that they take a very long time to write up for so little\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just the back wall behind the bed.\\
I know. But all together it's learning and it will be worth it\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: :fire::fire::fire::fire::fire:\\
I can see through your shirt :eyes::eyes::eyes::eyes::eyes::eyes::eyes:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahha\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: very sexy :eyes::eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: now that ive also looked at the room that is cool wall paper\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: At your place. There were 2 Amazon parcels for you that I have brought up and the bin.\\
Cat is currently eating and I added (probably too many) new dry biscuits for him.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you :red-heart:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :red-heart: nice. Looks better than it does here. Do you know what time it all kicks off?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Enjoy.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It has kicked off :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
It's chilly.\\What are you up to tonight?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll admit i didn’t realise the time :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: nice 2am bed time for you all then.\\
I have no idea. Pizza is cooking and I need a shower. Maybe games or maybe robot or maybe nothing. Do need to look at a water bottle for tomorrow.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully an early night for you. What time are you leaving tomorrow morning?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Getting picked up at 7:45 :loudly-crying-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh wow. Who is picking you up?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Cally. No doubt she will be late but still early. Gets the run over with.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope you have a chilled evening :red-heart:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: <attached: 00016632-VIDEO-2024-05-03-21-06-34.mp4>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Looks good.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Wish you were here :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Aww, would be fun to be there.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We're just waiting for cab back. Are you in bed yet?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not yet, just about to.\\
Have you had a good time?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes it was great.\\
I'm very hurty but it was good. How was your evening?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Glad you enjoyed but sucks it’s upped the pain.\\
I made the mistake of watching clarksons farm. Then watched the other 3 episodes that have been released :man-facepalming:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha, what a thing to binge\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Now I’m in bed.\\
Hope you sleep well and don’t hurt too much in the morning.\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart:\\Night night x x x x x x x\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We just got back.\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x\\
The bed was too soft so I ended up on the couch and with about 4 hours sleep :sleeping-face:\\It's glorious sunshine here .\\I hope it's not too muddy for you. I'll be thinking of you.\\Did you sleep okay?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, that is not a lot of sleep at all. :loudly-crying-face:\\
After last week I don’t think the mug can be worse and a little mud will help the running.\\Slept pretty well. Have a feeling I’ll sleep better tonight :grinning-face:\\Do you have a plan for this morning. Is exploring happening?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I'm not in a good way.\\
I'm waiting for the girls to wake up, then probably get ready and head out for breakfast somewhere. Maybe beach\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Does look like a good day. Get ready for the stones then if you go to the beach.\\
Obviously see how you’re feeling later but we can postpone or switch up tonight if needed.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully I'll just need a nap and a shower and I'll be better. And in any case we will both be broken :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good luck with the run! You'll smash it :flexed-biceps:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thanks, just parked.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just finished.\\
Damaged report\\Right ankle - unhappy\\Left toenail - afraid to take off sock\\Left and right hamstring - completely fucking broken and in full toddler melt down.\\Back - ok\\Right should - hurts for some reason\\Heart - seems good\\Lungs - still functional\\Eye - stinging from sweat\\Stomach - aches like it has all week\\Arms - totally broken from Wednesday\\Summary - all good, just a scratch\\:face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\Good run. 8km is clearly my sweat spot.\\How are you doing?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh my lord, that sounds horrendous.\\
How was it?\\I'm not great but on the way back. Will have a nap when I get home\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was good. Difficult to take in the sites as you have to look where you’re going but very pretty when we stopped.\\
Longest run I have ever done :thumbs-up:\\Oh I’m sorry. See how you feel after a nap but maybe we should postpone tonight given your out tomorrow and Tuesday. Prioritise rule 1.\\This isn’t be saying I don’t want  to see. I really want to see you but if your going to feel worse because of it the we can wait till tomorrow and or Monday\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Super well done! You absolutely smashed it :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
Are you on your way home?\\I'll see how I feel but if really really like to come see you and have dinner with you. Of course, if you're tired and need rest after the run that's absolutely fine\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think I’m going to be much more fine than you.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well we both still need to eat so might as well do it together :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: True but we can adapt if needed\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Real question. What order do I lunch shower bath in\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Lunch bath shower\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I was thinking shower lunch bath\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: food first seems sensible I’m just currently super spicy and covered in mud\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Eating first then I can lounge in the bath.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: An idle thought for Thursday. I sure you have a long list and I don’t really know what the appointment will cover but sleep seems to be the next thing to solve and get consistency with.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good plan\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Fun thing, I still haven't received the appointment letter from them so will have to pop to the GP on Tue to find out if they have any info\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Or the letter was lost\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's a possibility but still means I haven't received it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm home!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done. Spud all ok?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup, was waiting in the window\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I was just about to ask\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What did you have for lunch?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Couldn’t get what I wanted from the little shop we found so was just a sandwich deal thing plus some jerky and cakes I got from my mum.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You straight to nap or shower first or pottering\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: A little potter then nap, then shower\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Love the card from your parents. Thank you\/them\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And the bin! Looks so much bigger in my itty space\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Bin should work sidewise I think\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sideways\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh it should :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was nothing to do with me. I’ll send them a message\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you. It is very sweet of them (the card has a cat on it too :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:)\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Wow and I filled the dry food more than I thought.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you get “the look”\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Very much a "mother where have you been"\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm up! Will take a shower and sort myself out\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok, how you feeling after the nap?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm a bit slow moving (still not in the shower) but getting there\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm off to the shop\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yay, I best put on some better clothes then :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\

I went home through Downley AND didn't use sat nav :beaming-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Look at you. Full adult.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Slightly :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Little wins. Little wins\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s what it’s all about\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I assume you’ve made it to bed now?\\
Really enjoyed seeing you tonight. It’s just a lot of a fun being around you.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm still pottering :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I loved spending tonight with you. It's honestly the best :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Potter in the morning.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm on my way\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done. You taken all the drugs? Told the cat\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: All the drugs taken. Have you taken yours?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not yet. Not gone to bed yet\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You should!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Q3 is about to start!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Cat threw up a bit of his food. Hoping it's jus because he ate too fast\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What's that?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: F1 qualifying\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah yes\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Final fight for top 10 places\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Don’t normal watch qualifying but as it’s on might as well see it in missing out vs the you tube highlights\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Fair enough. Enjoy but hopefully you'll be getting some sleep\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I should sleep ok. The body is knackered\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It is. Hope the rest helps.\\
Well I'm all tucked in and drugged up :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night night then x x x x x x x x x\\

Oh hope you're not too sore. When is F1 today?\\I'm okay. Slept some but they were cleaning the tracks all night so woke up loads of times :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: :man-facepalming: can’t even make it up.\\
The soreness seems ok. F1 is late today. Race starts at 9pm\\You all set for Oxford?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that is late!\\
Glad you're not too bad. What are you up to today?\\I'm just getting ready\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m not sure why it’s so late as they are only -5 from us and they normally start the races at 3 local time. Might be a heat thing as it’s 30c in Miami at the moment.\\
Not really sure today. Might go for a walk. Probably some games and I’d like to do some robot stuff. I do have some washing to put away. :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah they probably don't want them to cook in them cars :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Oh definitely do a walk, it will loosen you up and it looks like glorious sunshine too :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just waiting for the train.\\
Hope you have a good day :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thanks. You too. Let me know when you’re on your way home. :red-heart:\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Finally!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh nice\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm just waiting for the train back. How's your day been?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Long day for you then. Did you have a good time?\\
Days been ok. Have made some pretty good progress with the robot. It moves better now and I can send commands from the phone. Brain just had a full short circuit on what to do next so will shower and hunt for food. Mum came over to get some plant from my front garden, so that was an hour :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It has. But it's been so lovely. I even managed to catch up with my old HoD before getting on the train - I've got more cards from the kids :loudly-crying-face:\\
Oh super well done on the robot stuff! It sounds like good progress.\\Haha, what plant did mum come to get?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: oh that's really good. I'll ask later how your HoD had cards from the kids but good that you got them.\\
Mum wanted some of the white flower things I have in the front garden. No idea what they are called.\\I'm assuming you wont be dropping by today?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I asked her to pick them up for me :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
Haha, you'll have to show me.\\I'd love to but I am absolutely pooped, sorry. Is it alright if we keep tomorrow though?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah we can keep tomorrow. I thought it was very optimistic that I'd see you today.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sorry :pensive-face: but I am quite hurty and I think a bath is the thing to do.\\
What did you fancy doing tomorrow?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know :red-heart:\\
No idea on tomorrow, we can see how your feeling. Could walk to the coffee place in Hughenden or something completely different. Depends if you wanted lunch or not\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I will feel well enough. I can feel it :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
We can definitely do a walk if it doesn't rain.\\What are you having for dinner?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: eh, how can you feel that you'll feel better?\\
Ahh yes the rain. We will see what happening. If you are feeling better we could always try out the new remote control toy while walking :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\CHEESE and some chicken that I bought plus a few snacks for the race when it starts. Assuming I dont eat the snacks before the race starts :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I feel like it would be better to try it out for the first time in the privacy of a home :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Oh yes, your Sunday dinner. Did you have sausage and eggs for lunch?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: that would be a much more sensible approach.\\
Yep. Classic Sunday eating. Really think I need to retire it.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, we could think of something to add, I'm sure\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think it more take stuff away rather then add.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah okay\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm home\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done. Bath time?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm just pottering :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I still cannot even imagine what this pottering is\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Most of the time I don't know myself\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Like a little roomba\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You made it. PURPLE\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Levander bath salts :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am already in bed :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Normal bed time for you :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Not a surprise given 2 bad nights in a row\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Even took drugs and all\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What have you been up to tonight?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Showered, food and now watching the race.\\
Aren’t you meant to take drugs before 9 anyway\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Melatonin\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh I see. Worth doing.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh of course.\\
I'll let you watch vroom vroom in peace.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00016776-GIF-2024-05-05-21-17-10.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night x x x x x x x x x x\\
Hope you sleep well and the race is a good watch.\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night x x x x x x  x\\

Hope you can finally get some rest.\\Looking forward to seeing you tomorrow\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00016779-GIF-2024-05-06-06-10-32.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
I've been up for a while trying to sort my phone out. It randomly decided to stop charging so I've literally just managed to get 1\% now. Don't know what's wrong.\\Yes, I'd like to go to the gym still, will see if I get it working off the cable\\Did you sleep well?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Slept for not long enough.\\
That’s a pain with the phone.\\Do you think it’s phone or cable?\\Good spin class though. You can push yourself when you think you can’t.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh did the race finish late?\\
It's the phone because I tried different cables and on different things and they worked. It's a pain.\\I'll see you in the gym\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have a wireless changing thingy you can use\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you in the gym?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Didn't see ya :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I saw you. Nice butt.\\
Just on my way home now\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha thanks.\\
I'm just making breakfast and then will have shower. What are we fancying today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I need to do the same.\\
Well I fancy you, obviously :face-with-rolling-eyes:.\\It’s currently not raining so we could mooch over to the cafe in Hughenden. Not sure what it’s like for lunch.\\Or we could go somewhere. Garden centre or Marlow? Probably mega busy as everyone else will have had the same idea.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah.\\
I'd like a walk and a mooch over at hughenden :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\What time shall I be aiming for?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Let’s do that then.\\
What time works for you. I at least need 30 minutes\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll probs need an hour. Just about to eat. Is that okay?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That works\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. I'll text when leaving\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Home!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :red-heart: hope you have a good nap.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
Sending all the productivity vibes for uni work :red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hope the nap has helped.\\
random ish thought. I’ve got shopping arriving on Wednesday if you would like anything added.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I overshot it with the nap but it was good :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Just had lunch\/dinner and will get moving with stuff.\\Thank you, I think I'm alright for bits. I'm just going to pop in for some fruit at some point.\\How's work going?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Going ok. I’m just “speed” (slow as hell) reading the chapter to get an overall sense.\\
It back talking about relativistic velocities and different reference frames.\\I am not so good at the math on different reference frames and general relativity. There does look to be a fun python exercise though\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Fun python exercise :face-with-tears-of-joy: love that.\\
I'm sure it's going to be hard work but you can do it. It might just need slow and steady approach\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: ?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just that it sounds amazing :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, other than the nachos most all inclusive places will be like that.\\
Mexico is a very long flight\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Omg, just a jooooke :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Work all done?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well, I’ve read the chapter :loudly-crying-face: think I’ve missed some of the point of it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Maybe a second read will help?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s what I’m hoping and there is a tutorial on it tomorrow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh hopefully that should clear up some bits\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you doing anything tonight?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think there is a few basic bits I need to look up again as well.\\
Just about to start some more robot stuff\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Busy busy bee\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sometimes\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well it's good to rest :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I did just drag through the end of the very last grand tour top gear thing. Very shit\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh god I haven't watched that for absolute years\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: you havn't missed anything\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You all set now?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hmmm.... Just about to get in the shower\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: been pottering then\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't know what I'm wearing or anything but will have a slow morning tomorrow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
But I did set up the bin and did two loads of laundry and did my nails\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Mega potter\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I had a probable stupid idea.\\
Did you want to have a drink at mine before you start work tomorrow? The thought here was it would give you a time waste so your not in the flat doing the hurry up and wait thing.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oooh. Thank you for thinking of me for tomorrow. And it's definitely not a stupid idea. But in all honesty I don't know. I do want to have a slow morning and get everything ready. But if I do end up ready early I'll text?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good idea or I could come to you. But only if it helps take pressure off not to add any on.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you managed to charge the phone?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. I'll let you know.\\
I do really appreciate you for thinking of this :red-heart:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It started charging on your thing when I went for a nap but only did 3\% by the time o woke up\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hmm, wireless is slow. I should have given you another charger as well.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll see what happens tonight\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: At least it added charge\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm assuming I'm getting a work phone tomorrow too\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Maybe, it might be a teams one on the laptop.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah maybe\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Although a work phone doesn’t fix your phone\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I want all the swag :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I knoooow\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s probably a dirty usb port\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully just that\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But I might contact the tech support as I might still be in warranty\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Worth a try\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You should get in the shower\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Will try the GP tomorrow too to see if they have any info on Thursday\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Going!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: For after the shower, what is missing for Thursday as I thought you had something to tell you about the appointment in the first place.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I only had a phone call. The letter never arrived\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm in bed, at a more reasonable time :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: well done. Have you set an alarm?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I have. For 7am :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you doing spin tomorrow?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: no i'm going to skip it given how broken my legs are. Planning on using the indoor bike instead to get something done\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's q good plan. You've done loads in the last few days\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: yeah, I need a bit more sleep tonight and legs needs a bit of recovery\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Definitely. Maybe take some melatonin?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I thought about it but i'm tired enough. Dont think it will be a problem. I did take one Saturday night\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I best wish you good night then x x x x x x x x . Big Day tomorrow. You will do great. Everyone will be excited that you are starting. Try to have fun with it.\\
Love YOu :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\section*{Tuesday $07\textsuperscript{th}$}
Night night, hope you sleep well x x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00016865-GIF-2024-05-07-07-45-58.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x\\
Woo hoo. I'm just doing my hair.\\Did you sleep well?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah I slept ok. Woke up in the middle of a dream which is very odd for me. Thrown me a bit. I was trying to jump over a fench to get into some shop but messed the jump and was then stuck on the fence before falling over the other side. I think I prefer not remembering dreams.\\
You avoided my question …\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha what a dream!\\
I had one first time in absolute years - I dreamt that I woke up with a skin reaction to my nighttime skin routine and had to go in like that :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\I'm feeling alright. Slightly fuzzy tummy but I think that's normal\\What are you up to today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s sounds like normal  nerves.\\
You’ll do great today.\\Need to try and get stuff done this morning. This afternoon Dad and I are going to go to the cinema to see “the fall guy”.\\Not been in ages and it’s something we used to do almost once a week. This is the first film all year that looks worth seeing. Then squeeze in some more work before the tutorial. I feel it might be a light work day.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that's amazing! I heard it's a good one. Are you going to a Wycombe one?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah going to Wycombe. It’s a shame really. Covid ruined movies, probably forever\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah it did.\\
Next time you guys should treat yourselves to Everyman in Marlow :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\I love you're doing this with your dad\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Every now and then we mix in lunch or dinner.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :smiling-face-with-hearts::smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Managed to get hold of the hospital. Appointment is definitely happening :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh that’s great news.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes! Apparently they sent the letter on 13 march\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But my GP didn't have anything either\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I just saw your response to yesterday’s paired. Why don’t you think you’re pulling your weight? There are more things than just paying for stuff and we can definitely get creative. Spending time together shouldn’t automatically mean that we need to spend money.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sounds like my scan results “we send them”\\
Yeah I to the void. :man-facepalming:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Bet they used the wrong address or something\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We checked the address and apparently they used the right one :woman-shrugging-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hmm, for 2 letters to go missing. Sounds sus\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think it's negative talk from PTSD... Working on it :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What's the 2nd?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I thought you said they send you and your GP something both not received.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No, GP should get it on my file automatically\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Either way it’s very strange for letters to go missing but not impossible given your post setup\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's happening and that is the important bit :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yes!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I hope you enjoy your first day and it goes well. :red-heart:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you :red-heart::red-heart:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have a good day too\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: got that fast\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just had lunch and popped out for a walk. Caught up with Michael too\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your morning been?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh that’s good.\\
Mornings been ok. Somehow not got much done but have printed out a stack of new recipes to try out.\\Just sat in the cinema waiting for the film to start.\\Hope the rest of your day goes well.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Enjoy the film and say hello to dad\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was the film?\\
I finished and popping to aldi\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh well done.\\
Film was good. It’s quite fun, lots of good stunts. It had good pacing until near the end and then it started going a bit all over the place.\\How was your first day as a corporate girly?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I'm glad you enjoyed it.\\
Did you manage more work this afternoon?\\I am pooped from information overload but everyone has been lovely, I filled out the form for the gym too. I now need to go through all the paperwork etc tomorrow\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not really managed much work today. Seems to take a full afternoon to see a 2 hour film.\\
I bet it’s a full high mental load day. Glad it went well.\\I’m assuming you don’t have to think about anything until til your back tomorrow?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah you deserve a slower day, you did work over the weekend\\
I just need to try the laptop at home to make sure it's working on my WiFi so I don't have any issues in Thurs\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You absolute sweetheart :face-blowing-a-kiss:\\
Thank you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: :red-heart:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: If your free 6th of July get it blocked out. One of my friends 40th\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh who's bday?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Mike's\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't know who that is but it's booked :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: He is part of a whole group you haven't been able to meet yet. He is part of the Mike, James, ALex, Carl Ross group\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah cool\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: when's book club? is this for the andy wier book\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: At 8.15 I think. No this is the other one, Andy Weir is next week\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How was book club?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just finished\\
About 20mins book and 1hr catch up :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\How was tutorial?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, tutorial was tough. Lots of hard concepts. Physics gets weird when stuff starts moving near the speed of light and then there is stuff we can see that looks like it moves faster than light (it doesn’t) then your brain hurts because the light from the further observation left at a different time than the light that looks like it’s travelling faster than light.\\
Otherwise it was great.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That sounds so so hard. I don't think my brain even registered that concept.\\
Did it clarify any bits from the chapter?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: There were a few bits that really helped. It’s just a lot of what I find to be very unintuitive maths mixed with time dilation. This is all so that fast spinning super massive black holes at galactic centers can spew matter out into the universe and escape the gravity of the galaxy it was in.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well I'm glad some bits helped\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you get your laptop tested? What time have you got your alarm set for?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup, all working. Got a brand new think pad\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Alarm is set for 6\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s good. Nice lie in then for you :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:. What time do you need to be at the office?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll be going in for just before 8 normally, so I can finish 4 ish. But it's the team social tomorrow\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Is that straight after work or will you come home first?\\
8am is a good time. The “main” road up to Cressex is an absolute nightmare between 8:30-9\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Straight after work. Going to the squirrel in booker (??)\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's my Lm's bday and a little team welcome for me\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think I’ve been there. It isn’t very far from cressez\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s nice.\\
How do you feel now you’ve had some time to relax in the evening\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Tired but good. It will be better once I don't feel so out of water not knowing what my actual job is :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That will both come quickly and take a while. Just try not to put too much pressure on yourself. It isn’t even realistic for a new employee to do all that much in their first month.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You see that's such a weird concept for me because in teaching you're in on 100\% the minute you step foot in a (new) school\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Another example of what schools do that literally no other company does.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Definitely\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm all tucked in now :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night x x x x x x x x x x x hope you sleep well and enjoy the lay in.\\
Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night x x x x x x x x\\
\section*{Wednesday $08\textsuperscript{th}$}
I’m off to bed now as well.\\Hope you sleep well.\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Morning x x x x\\
Day 2 woooo. Hope today goes well.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x\\
You're up before your alarm. Did you sleep well?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Alarm was set for 7:30 today. Maybe should have pushed it later but never mind.\\
Slept ok. Feeling it in the hamstrings this morning.\\Have you already made it to the office? What was this morning taste of the new routine like\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just about to leave. I'm definitely feeling better for not getting up at 5 :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
What are you up to today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s good. Definitely better getting up at 6.\\
I’ve got shopping arriving this morning from Sainsburys. Already not worth the hassle of ordering from them as they have substituted the main part of my order so will have to go to a shop anyway. Maybe after tomorrow’s appointment.\\Just need to crack on with work today. Will go for a walk and I have the hacker group meeting this evening. Want to use the bike as well.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sounds like a productive day :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: hope you have a great one!\\
I've just parked up in the underground garage :face-with-open-mouth:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Look at you! :red-heart:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: \#corporategirlie\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What did they substitute?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: My yogurts!\\
It’s just like when Alexa doesn’t listen. As soon as it goes wrong it costs time.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m also not going to Wales in a couple of weeks. So I am now around the weekend of our 6 month anniversary.\\
Poor planning from Rich as Kate has some wedding thing to go to. So we’ve moved it to some weekend in June.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no! The most important thing\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that's a shame that you're not going but really glad you'll be around :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
I am volunteering for SDR on the Saturday\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Exactly :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s a bit of a pain but does give me a weekend back for any revision etc. so could be better that my exams will be done by the time I see them.\\
Do you know what you’re volunteering for?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that might work better then.\\
It's for their summer fête thingy so something stall based maybe\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Having some thought about tomorrow. Is your appointment 8:30? So probably need to be there 8:15.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That would be great\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok, think to be safe that means a 7:30 pick up.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. Thank you again coming with me\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s ok. Do you want me in the room or am I just driving you?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No, I'll be alright in the room, thank you :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your morning been?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s been ok. Did a walk and a bit on the bike. Work has been a slog.\\
The code I was writing was easy but the answers were wrong. There is some trick that I don’t know as to when to use angles in degrees or radians. Something else to add to the list.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh silly code. Do the forums have any clarification for that issue?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I've not seen anything on the forums. I might ask the question. I knew the answer was wrong as I was getting a negative number for a speed. Which is wrong.\\
Hope the day is going well.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You can always ask :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
When is your hacker group?\\I'm just heading to the pub for a little bit\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I've just asked a dumb question on the forum so will wait before I ask the next one. I get the same wrong answer in code and via a calculator vs what the book says. So I have no idea what is going on.\\
Its at 7:30 tonight.\\OH, enjoy. \#corporatelife\\Let me know about your day once you get home.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Will do :red-heart:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Heya. Just parked up at home.\\
Hope hacker group is good tonight - it's the in person one isn't it?\\Day was busy but I don't feel I got any work done. We watched a live stream of the conference\/celebrations etc that were happening downstairs (not enough room for everyone), then we had lunch, I went for a little walk and then tried to do some onboarding training but internet was temperamental because of the sheer numbers in the office and live stream and all so only managed a few modules. Then had another catch up with LM and then pub. Pooped again but definitely not in the same way as coming home from a day of teaching. I think I might need to get some noise cancelling\/reducing headphones for the office\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sounds like a normal corporate day. Glad it’s going well.\\
I have a set of headphones that you can try out if you like.\\Yeah In  person, just arrived.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Enjoy! Text me when you're home x\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm heading to bed. Hope the group meet was good.\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: See you soon\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m guessing you’ve managed to start work ok?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup all logged in and making my way through training.\\
What are you up to today? The rest of the chapter?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah finishing the chapter (hopefully) it’s a weirdly long chapter.\\
Will walk and bike again. I’ve got Becky coming over for dinner later as well.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I guess it's because it's the last one?\\
Nice. The weather is perfect for it.\\Oh lovely. What are you making? What time is she coming?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have no idea. Think the author just had fun with the chapter or there is more back story than normal.\\
Going to do the chickpea curry and see how that goes. I think about 7:30. Becky isn’t the best with time as she is always doing a lot. We will see.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah hope it's interesting at least.\\
Oh that will be nice. It's such an easy and tasty meal. Hope Becky is alright. Say hello from me - and I am still trying to get answers for her, just the Ofsted buggered my meeting with the DSL so will have to meet with her on a weekend\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thanks I’ll let her know.\\

But I think because I'm only working from home 2 days, I might have a proper table rather than a desk. I don't know\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I thought you needed a desk that can go up and down?\\
And a table to eat at\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes yes. I just don't know\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The aesthetic of it :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Rule 1 first, aesthetics at least second maybe fifth.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes I do get that. But I do want my flat to look more homely\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The pain from COVID is the lack of dedicated space. I think you need a place where work can be setup all the time that is only for work. So you can walk away from it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I guess we need to do TV side so you can see what space you can play with\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, I was just going to say that\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just having lunch\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just about to do the same\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also \#oldladythoughts.... I'm loving my new bin :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think it’s more \#sadadultgoals\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Shhh.... \#dullwomanexcitement\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You forget. I was super excited about that bin. It copper for goodness sake. Then the massive disappointment that it was no good for me.\\
Full sine wave of emotion over a BIN\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahahah\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It fits\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Perfectly\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: If you had a combi washer dryer you’d get even more space\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Then you could have 3 bins :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha. Then I would have a dishwasher\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That would be better.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: yes please\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: One of each?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: yes please\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Done :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thank you :red-heart:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm in b\&q. Do you need anything?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: probably but I wont remember until the weekend. What are you doing in B\&Q\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Pottering :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Came to pick up some gardening gloves\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you get everything you wanted?\\
I think I’ve worked out at least one thing on how to fix the mouse code. Bit of a pain but the bodge I put in ages ago has come back to haunt me. I have at least got the computer to tell me the issues now.\\What you doing for the rest of the evening?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah :face-with-tears-of-joy: just felt like a garden centre potter. I actually have the mental space for it.\\
Oh that's good! Some progress is still progress!\\I'm just making some food and then probably a book - I'm very behind on bookclub book.\\Is Becky on her way?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s a good marker that you have the mental space while onboarding.\\
Yep, small steps.\\That Andy weir book can be a bit of a slog as well. Lots of science in it.\\Yeah, she got delayed be I see she has had to stop to buy the food she was meant to bring from home. I think everyone I know has ADHD :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: what was she supposed to bring?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Naan bread. Got it sorted\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just off to bed.\\
Hope you had a nice evening.\\Night night, sleep well x x x x x x x x x x\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Becky just left. I’ll be off to bed soon enough.\\
\section*{Friday $10\textsuperscript{th}$}
Hope you got enough of your book done.\\Sleep well. Night x x x x\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Morning x x x x x x\\
You still going to the gym this morning?\\Now that your all about that working from home corporate life :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x\\
Yes, just about to leave\\Did you sleep well?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah slept ok. It’s is warm now!\\
I guess I’ll see you in the gym in a bit.\\Did you get your new drugs yet?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It is warm!\\
Yes please, come say hello.\\No, it's 5 working days for prescription\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: :man-facepalming: of course it is. Of course it takes a week for a doctor to write a bit of paper to give to another doctor to type something that you can then use to get drugs.\\
Nothing ineffective, rage inducing or expensive for all involved about that.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You didn't come say hello :confused-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I did say hello!\\
I over thought it and don’t want to interrupt your set.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't overthink it. You can definitely interrupt me\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was your session?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sorry.\\
It was good. All body one today. Squats and bench. Shouldn’t be too broken for Sunday. That’s the hope anyway.\\How was yours? 20tons a today :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: <This message was edited>\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sounds good\\
I did some squats and then upper body. But I was very sensible, only 5 tonnes\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What are you up to?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I forgot I have a GP appointment at 6.30 tonight. But it's a phone call so should be able to do from yours\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Taking the raptor for a walk :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh she's so grown\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Is she staying with you today?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah I have her until about 4.\\
She has got longer\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And you kept that a secret!!!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not on purpose\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I meant to tell you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sure, sure\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Your welcome to come over and say hello\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Too many meetings :confused-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Corporate life\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Indeedy\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Give her cuddles for me\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Will do\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00017056-GIF-2024-05-10-10-33-34.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was walk?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was good. She is really good off lead. Recall is pretty good but could be better. Such a clumsy oaf.\\
Played real nice with a lab. Met a few other dogs and then for woofed at by a bit dog. I don’t think the big dog liked the puppy energy.\\Played in the stream and got all muddy. She has been knackered since\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00017061-VIDEO-2024-05-10-13-43-54.mp4>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How’s the corporate life?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Awwwww\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Busy! A few meetings, training. Quite overwhelming tbh\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just take one meeting at a time.\\
Don’t over pressure yourself just because you at home.\\Meetings stop work but meetings are what people see.\\Training takes time and it’s always hard to learn new stuff.\\Breath.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's very challenging for me to go from being the expert to literally not knowing anything\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Very understandable. It’s always more comfortable when you know things. There was a time when you weren’t an expert at being a teacher  but you did that.\\
You can do this. Just take your time.\\You’ll put more pressure on yourself than work will.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: There is also an advantage of being new. Everyone else also knows your new so will be willing to help. Or they should be.\\
If the expert doesn’t know something people get annoyed.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Your welcome.\\
Working from home is hard. It’s easy to feel like people are watching your status or timing your emails.\\They aren’t or if they are then it’s a toxic work place. Something for next week. Check in (:face-vomiting: corporate words) with your LM and get there expectations of what you should be completing in what time frame. If you agree that’s realistic then all good.\\Corporate work is about the output other people see. Not the hours you work.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I have a catch up with her on Monday so will bring it up\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No pressure but thoughts on timings for later?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: All tuckered out\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I have just finished with my last meeting, need to tie up some bits, then shower and get ready. Hopefully get to you before my 6.30 GP call?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sounds good\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You’re bringing dinner right?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes yes. Do you want anything extra for me to pick up?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Erm, I have no idea.  I don’t have any puddings\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: For us I mean.\\
I probably need to do a small shop tomorrow for stuff that didn’t arrive on Wednesday\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Do you want one?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Up to you. I don’t know that we need one and I can get one for us for tomorrow night.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I was just thinking I'm not in a pudding mood :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That works then\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How ready are you for me to come over?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m ready\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. I'll head over in a min\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: <attached: 00017089-Elvis Medford.vcf>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Home!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yay.\\
I had a lot of fun tonight.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Me too\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope I'm not too weird. It's just so nice feeling better\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just weird enough. I’m really pleased you’re feeling good.\\
This was the point of going through all this work and change.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Today is certainly the most energy I’ve seen you have after doing some exercise and not having a nap. That ignores the full days work.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: May it long continue\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also, I love laughing with you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep, or it all linked to the sun and we just need massively powerful sun lights\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Me too\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am a cat :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: it does explain a lot\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you doing anything more tonight?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just gone through calendar and WhatsApp to check and move events around. Going to have a stab at writing \/ reworking some code\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Do you have any new plans?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: July 6th MIGHT move to the 5th and my friend Ross is trying to book something for the 24 or 31st Aug\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You're planning well in advance!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: as I said. My friends are a nightmare to get in the same room.\\
It was all bad enough when it was just girlfriends and wives. Then they had kids and ruined it\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha. I know what you mean. Adult friendships are hard to organise\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Took my drugs and pottered all the way to bed\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: well done. I thought you took the drugs at mine?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: you listening to the book\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Melatonin :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night. Hope some code works and you sleep well x x x x x x x x x\\
Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night x x x x x x x x x x x\\
\section*{Saturday $11\textsuperscript{th}$}
Love YOU :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Morning x x x x x x\\
It is somehow already mega hot in my house.\\How did you sleep and what did you decide for the morning?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x\\
I can imagine. It's reasonably cool in the flat.\\I slept okay. Decided just to clean my flat - don't want to overdo it just because I'm feeling better. Garden today and Marlow tomorrow is going to be more than enough.\\What's your plan for the morning?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sounds like a very sensible plan. Just in the process of getting up and will get some breakfast. Then need to nip to the shop and I have a parcel to pickup.\\
What time did you want to come over?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think I'd like to fit a little nap in so say 12?\\
Would you be able to pick up some Bananas for me when you're at the shop?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: What about lunch?\\
Yes I can I get bananas. How many?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I can eat here but will bring prawns and rice for later.\\
5 please x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sounds good. I did have a silly idea yesterday that you could nap here but on reflection that maybe a risk too far. You also planning to shower here? (Which is fine)\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Be glad that spud is an indoor cat. Cally cat brought hope a HUGE rat last night. Still alive and then killed it in the house. Blood and guts everywhere. Walls! Floor, pipe work.\\
Now the cat needs to go to the vet as the rat fought back a bit.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, I'll shower before dinner if that's okay\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh noooooo :face-with-open-mouth: and ewww\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Of course the shower is ok. Just checking.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Gives me a couple of hours to get the camera set up :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: we missed this!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I didn’t see shit. My friend could only see it through his camera and not with his eyes\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: There are so many pics on fb\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, they are everywhere. Can try again tonight.\\
Somehow never see this sort of stuff in Wycombe\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think it was all around midnight - I was dead to the world\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Same but I did leave my Audi book on so woke up at 2am all confused\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha.\\
What are you listening to?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: New sci fi book. Think it’s the end of a trilogy\\
\url{https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/B0CY5WWSRC?source-code=ASSORAP0511160006&share-location=player-overflow}\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: So I just woke up :confused-face: will be as soon after 12 as I can\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok, I’m just out shopping\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Slow cooker\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Leaving now\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Home!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done. Really enjoyed today :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Me too. It was such a good day :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm in bed finally :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Pottered away :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you for today.\\
Night night x x x x x x x x x x\\See you in the morning.\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night night x x x x x x x x x x x\\
\section*{Sunday $12\textsuperscript{th}$}
See you for the run.\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00017153-GIF-2024-05-12-06-25-08.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x\\
I'm decent. My hands are a bit swollen and hurt but alright.\\How are you feeling?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I guess that’s pretty good given how we were.\\
I’m ok. A bit tired but that’s about it. Itchy eyes. Might need to add hayfever drops into the mix.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah it's good. I'm tired but hopefully will survive today.\\
Oh definitely add in some drops, the pollen count will be high\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think showering basically washed loads of garden stuff into my eyes and face which is why I was suffering after the shower.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no. Hopefully it's not too bad today\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hold on\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What's happening\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I can pick you up\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you sure?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you not going?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Mark is going\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah alright\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Do you want me to pick you up instead?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That might help but I can drive your car if you like. I need to get changed\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll come get you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: See you in a bit\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Leaving\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Where r u\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Was testing my phone. Apparently my mic doesn’t work now\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh bugger\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It was all cracklu\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sweat maybe?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Was trying to work out if it was me or mum. Probably sweat. :man-facepalming:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope it dries out\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Unsurprisingly Nan is being admitted to hospital. “Just” waiting on an ambulance.\\
Now just running a quick bath.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I guess it's good they are taking her in. She'll get the best care option there. Have they picked her up yet?\\
I just woke up from a nap\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: No pick up yet. Mark has left. So it just my Nan and dad.\\
Mark recons this is the beginning of the end. We will see.\\Nothing that can be done.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm sorry. This is a really hard situation.\\
How are you doing with it all?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m ok with it. Nothing has happened yet but I’ve been expecting it for a while.\\
She is very stubborn and just refuses to do simple things to take care of her self.\\TBH I’m not beyond believing she has done this on purpose to prove some point or is just done with it all.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They can be very stubborn, the oldies.\\
I'm here for whatever you need :red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thank you. Just a waiting game at the moment\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How do you feel after your nap\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm okay. Nap was needed and I'm hurty but okay. Just having food.\\
How are you feeling?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Legs current really hurt. Calf’s mainly. And the normal post run headache\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no. Have you rolled out?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Erm, not really\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know it will be painful but it will help\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: the hunger has hit me like a train :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah. What are you having?\\
I couldn't eat my food earlier so still waiting for it\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: About to go hunting. Could do classic cheese and I have some chicken or I could do the tuna. Not sure I can be bothered to actually cook. Tuna steaks would make a nice lunch tomorrow.\\
Second day with no lunch then!\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I think cooking is out of the question for me too.\\
Those options sounds good! And you still have risotto?\\Well yes. But I really wasn't hungry and I did have my clear whey. And I managed to eat some bacon medallions\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I just realised that my earbuds are currently in my shorts....in the washing machine :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone::woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone::woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone::woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone::woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone::woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone::woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone::woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So you had bacon for lunch but it wasn’t lunch :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
The risotto was my lunch.\\Oh whoops. They should be ok. Just leave them out to dry for a few days but I would try and force the drying.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well it was like 2 medallions\\
Ah ok. Was it still nice?\\It was very woops :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone: hope they do work.\\How's your afternoon been?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah it was still good.\\
You’ll find out soon enough. Just take them as apart as they can be and leave them out. Afternoon was ok. Bath, shower, games and now food.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: How have you done on you book?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sounds like a good afternoon. I'll do a bath before bed, had a nice cold shower :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
How's Matt?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've got 4 hours left so making good progress!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is good progress on the book. You can get that finished by tomorrow.\\
Matt’s ok. Currently sick, think it will be good once he gets past the funeral on Wednesday.\\He has a job interview in Leeds next Monday.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully I'll get it finished between, today, morning and after work.\\
That's good. It's such a hard situation.\\Are you doing more games after dinner?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Done with games today. Maybe some tomorrow. Will watch tv and be done I think,\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sounds good. Watching anything interesting?\\
I am, predictably, pottering\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Everything alright?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, yeah I’m alright. Didn’t see you message. Just been zoned out.\\
Nan has now made it through hospital and will be in for a couple of days. Doctor recons severe dehydration.\\Doesn’t solve the obvious problem that she isn’t drinking enough when on her own but still something.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just finished off clarksons farm\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh okay. Just showed read so I thought I'd ask.\\
It's good they are keeping her. Hopefully they'll get her back to a good state. It's a shame that it seems like a slightly self-inflicted state. We had similar with my grandfather.\\Would it be possible to have her carer in more often?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think it is self inflicted or at least partially self inflicted.\\
She will have to have care more often. That will create tears.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully she'll get used to it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s what happened last time. Full meltdown about having someone and now that someone is the best thing ever\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The older you get the harder it is to get used to change I guess\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I finished bones\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I was just thinking.. have you thought about a date that would be something for you?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Change is always hard. The real hard bit is the lack of consideration that the decisions have on others.\\
That took ages or are there more seasons than I remember. I thought you were close to the last season.\\I have been thinking. I maybe have an idea but not sure yet.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: There were 12 seasons so quite a bit\\
Oh do you want to share?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s not a fully formed idea yet.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And I might have a better thought :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You can have more than 1 idea\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And now I'm very intrigued\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The only small spark on an idea I’ve had is that we go to see the back to the future musical in London. Probably as a Saturday afternoon showing.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Brilliant!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We can definitely do this. And we can do whatever else you think of :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope you had a relaxing evening. I'm all tucked in bed and no Sunday scaries :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s really good. I’ll be heading off soon.\\

It was hot last night and for some reason I was awake early.\\Hope you slept ok.\\Let’s see how busy spin is today.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x\\
Yeah, I woke up couple of times because of it.\\My legs are hurty :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: how are you feeling?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: P.S. I miss my morning GIFs. You got me used to them :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think the legs are meant to hurt :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:. I’m ok. Legs a bit sore and now tired.\\
I’ll do better with the GIFs\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I hope today's gym exploits are not going to break you :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Spin :loudly-crying-face::weary-face::hot-face::hot-face:\\
Good luck with your first Monday.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00017240-GIF-2024-05-13-08-32-15.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was the class?\\
And thank you :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was really good. Lots of people as well. Just super hard with yesterday’s run. The class really pushed you. Legs are definitely done.\\
Might switch it up this week and have tomorrow as the rest. As we are swimming on Wednesday.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm glad you had a good class!\\
Hopefully Hannah is not working your legs today too?\\That's a good plan! You do need a rest day after this weekend.\\Are you coming to westhorpe with me on Wednesday?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Should be arms today.\\
That’s the plan for Wednesday. Do you have any times yet?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that's good on both accounts.\\
Hopefully should finish by 4-4.30 and just go home to change to be there by 5.30? Could pick you up?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That would be good. I wondered if you go straight from work.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'd definitely want to go drop off the laptop etc at home and should be done by 4 hopefully\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Do you have the velociraptor today?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I was meant to but because of Nan I’m not going to my parents once my shopping arrived to dog sit both dogs.\\
Absolutely ruined now.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah yes that makes sense. Will you be working from there or just relax?\\
Tough session?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Bit of a change. Just going over there for a cup of tea now. No chance I could have done any work there or here with the puppy as all of it needs the computer. Does mean I might be able to do something this afternoon.\\
Very tough. There was a small leg circuit as Hannah didn’t think I’d have done spin :loudly-crying-face: and a  bit of general low energy from yesterday and a crap sleep.\\Hope your day is going well.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah cool. You're having a fluid day!\\
Oh bubs, definitely another bath tonight and rest. You've done so much in the last three days.\\Say hello to parents from me, hope they are doing alright\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah my brain is all over the place at the moment.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What can I do?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I don’t think there is anything. You can think dinner for Thursday as I’m not sure you’ll want my batch cooked chicken thingy I’m trying tomorrow.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Please talk to me about it though, okay?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok, I will\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good. I'm here for all of it :red-heart:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your day been?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s been ok. Just got back from Mum and Dads. Dad went off to the hospital about 4. Doctor never phoned so he going to find out what might be happening.\\
We don’t expect much. Ran through options with my Mum. Likely outcome is she will either leave hospital for a home (the hospital now know she lives on her own) or she just won’t leave.\\My dad isn’t great at talking about stuff and doesn’t really have any friends local to talk to so he is finding it all quite hard (not that he would say).\\My mum doesn’t help because she phrases questions in an accusatory way which then puts my dad in defence mode.\\Really all a wait and see but her muscle strength isn’t going to go up while in hospital and was already at the point she could barely walk.\\All just a lot of stuff I have no control over.\\How was you day?\\Counselling now and then bookclub?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: This is a lot popette. And I know all you want is come up with solutions. I'm really sorry dad is not sharing stuff with you guys, it must be really hard for him thinking about it all.\\
Day was massively full on, in meetings the whole time.\\Counselling at 6.30 and then bookclub.\\Do you want me to stop by after?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: No you don’t need to stop by but thank you.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I hate that I can't make it better\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know but there is nothing that can be done to change anything for now.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know. Just know that I am here for happy or sad, or if you want to talk and I just listen, or talk through anything or just sit in silence, or a hug. Or whatever you want\/need.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How was counselling?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It was a tough one today\\
How's your evening going? What are you up to?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m sorry it’s tough.\\
How so?\\Had dinner and now playing games.\\I tried one of the new simple recipes I found. Was really good but I did think. “This needs peas” :loudly-crying-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's just because they're assessing me for trauma counselling so it drudges up icky things.\\
Oh which one did you make?\\Haha, peas are niiiiice.\\Just got home\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Managed to potter very quickly and all tucked in.\\
Hope games were good tonight.\\Night night, sleep well x x x x x x x x x x x\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Dinner had the grand name of Mongolian beef. It was nice but it could be bulked out quite easily with chick peas, beans or peas.\\
Did you finish the book in time for tonight?\\Games were ok. Nothing special but not awful.\\Night x x x x x x x\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that sounded good. You'll definitely be able to upgrade it next time.\\
I did manage. I finished it 2 mins before counselling :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: I really liked it.\\Hopefully even if the games weren't spectacular you had a bit of brain rest\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I really liked the book. Not sure it has repeat value. A few bits were a bit too much science but the overall idea was really good.\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00017274-GIF-2024-05-14-08-20-54.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x x\\
Ha, I bet - you don't tend to have Tuesdays as rest days.\\I'm okay. Legs still very hurty.\\How are you feeling? Body and mind?\\Yes, I'm in training literally the whole day. What's your plan?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah my legs still hurt as well. So good really to have the rest day. Otherwise I’m ok. Just feels like I’ve got a lot of stuff to do before I can do the stuff I want\/need to do.\\
Need to nip to the shop to buy something I forgot from yesterday.\\Then I can have a go at making these breakfast muffins things I want to try.\\I’ve got to get my haircut today, iron a shirt for tomorrow. Set up the slow cooker at lunch for dinners. Then I can look at some work.\\Remember to takes breaks and get up to walk about. Training can fry the mind.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What is the stuff you need to do before you can do the stuff you want to do?\\
You have a busy busy day! Make sure you take it easy too.\\Well I'm limited to the breaks they give us, it's facilitated on line but live :pensive-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Everything that isn’t work or hobbies is the stuff I need to do before the stuff I want to do. I’m very aware tomorrow is probably going to be a write off as well.\\
Oh, that makes it a bit tricker but at least you could stand up and dash to the kitchen while people are talking\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Is there anything I can help with? Be honest\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I really don’t think so and you have more than enough going on.\\
What I really need is staff :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I do have space to help you out, always. I can be staff :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, well today stuff is all time sensitive. I’m pretty sure all the jobs I’ve got to do very much go against feminism if you volunteer to do them for me.\\
I probably shouldn’t have complained anyway. I’m constantly being told how easy my life is.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Babs, it's not pain Olympics. Whatever you have going on is valid, doesn't matter if it's different to someone else's.\\
And feminism is equality - if it's cleaning you need help with, I'll help you with cleaning. Or cooking. Or whatever. A relationship is partnership - if I can help alleviate something for you, I want to do that.\\Please don't ever feel like you can't complain, ever. I'm always here for a whinge.\\Tell me what I can help with\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thank you. I’m ok.\\
Have had breakfast and cooked a bit. Going to have my coffee and get on with other stuff.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: What time are we having lunch on Sunday?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okay. But I want to help\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 2pm. Might have to leave between 12-1\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Why?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Trying to work out when at the weekend is best to go see Nan in hospital so that dad doesn’t have to go on his own.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Do you want me to change the booking?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What time is the SDT thing Saturday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm there all day but I think something like 10-4?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Lemme check\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 12-4\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: On\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your afternoon been?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Its been ok. Got my haircut this morning. Slow cooker is on. Have done a very small amount of work. Just about to go and sort my shirt for tomorrow otherwise I can see it getting left to late.\\
How's training going?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oooh haircut. Can't wait to see :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
What time is the funeral tomorrow?\\The morning was really good. The afternoon got cancelled so I cracked on with other bits.\\Going to pop to Aldi later - do you need anything?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: its at 11:30 tomorrow. Lester is picking me up at 11.\\
After we are coming back to get changed then going to the Lady Spencer. Not sure why the clothes change but will go with it.\\Oh that's got to be a little handy that it got cancelled. Glad it was good.\\I think I've got everything I need for now thanks.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah good. How are you feeling about it?\\
Hmm, what are you getting changed into?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: the funeral? More awkward than anything. I didn't know Matt's parents at all.\\
I think its just to get changed out of suit into more comfy clothes. Rather than just stay in suit the whole time. Just feels like it will take more time\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah okay. That makes sense\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Any news about nan?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: not really. This was the last update from yesterday "Concern at the moment is her kidneys due to the dehydration, so they are keeping her on the drip for the next couple of days and will then go from there" and I had a call with Mum earlier to try and work out when I can go with Dad to visit but I've got to ask Dad about it.\\
I suspect she will be there for quite a while, at least a week. The issue will be if she gets better about the hospital releasing her as I highly doubt she will pass any sort of test that shows she can live on her own.\\She didn't move around much anyway and guess she isn't currently moving at all. So any muscle she had will be getting less.\\It all really started to go down hill when they didn't replace their dog.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: This is so tough. I hope you manage to go with your dad.\\
Honestly if the only time you can go is Sunday we can rejigg our plans\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I'll be able to find a lot. Really it will either be Saturday afternoon or Sunday morning. I would like to at least see the SDR stuff but that might have to be missed. Its a good hour round trip to the hospital.\\
As always these things never happen at the right time. This is literally the only 3 weeks in the last year where I just need to be able to control my own time.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Is she in Stoke?\\
Well if you think of anything I can take off your plate so you can just concentrate on family and work, please let me know - no matter what it is.\\Also, fajitas for dinner on Thursday?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: She is in Wexham. Which I think is technically closer and seems a better hospital anyway.\\
Thank you. If you can deal with what dinner is then that is a great help.\\Fajitas is great. I have the seasoning but nothing else :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I've never been there.\\
Don't worry, I'll sort everything (and I'll keep asking if I can help, sorry)\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thanks.\\
I like that you ask. Its not something I am good at doing and I do then feel odd asking for help.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Please don't feel odd asking for help - I genuinely want to do something to help you because I love and care about you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I will feel odd but I am trying to get better.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know you are, and that's the important bit :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
Hope the tutorial is good. What is it on?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: its about gamma ray burts. Its with a good tutor. Going well so far although he is talking about cones of gamma ray jets travelling at near the speed of light\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh it's about your last chapter!\\
Enjoy!\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did it end up being good?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah it was helpful. Long. Helpful recap. It was a very long chapter.\\
How was your evening?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's been alright.\\
You know what I've realised - I don't know what to do with myself without being absolutely knackered and staring at a wall :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, that is somewhat expected. I’m guessing your also not sat worrying about some lesson plan or other school based thing.\\
This is where hobbies comes in.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I didn't think I was going to be so aimless :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
I'm sure I'll fall into a grove soon enough.\\I need to get back into them.\\Are you up to anything post tutorial?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s only week 2 or day 6 really.\\
If anything it very positive that you feel that way.\\Just about to have a shower then I might have a quick go at seeing if my robot changes work in any way\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know. It's just a weird feeling. Long may the positives continue\\
Oh hope it works the way you want it. I'm going to do a closing shift and then bed\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think your using the word weird wrong :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
How it used to be was weird, you just made it normal.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah. Well it does feel abnormal to me at the moment :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s the problem with some types of jobs. It completely normalises they’d weird traits. Like it being completely normal not to be able to do things in the evening or have time for hobbies etc. only time to either be doing work or be thinking about work.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know - teaching does take over your life completely.\\
Hopefully I'll learn how to actually relax now :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: In bed :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
What did the robot do?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: its done something\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: not sure what it has done yet\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good or bad?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: in theory it looks like it was doing what it was before but now I can change stuff. I just changed a setting and it went mad. So that is actual progress. A new error is always interesting\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh progress is good! Well done\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to turn in now.\\
Night night x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x sleep well when you get to bed\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night x x x x x x x x xx\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: Some sucess with the robot. I undid a change I made from Ipswich. It will now drive in a straight line.\\
I’m not back to the problem I had in Ipswich which is if I tell it to make a turn. It does make the turn. Just 270 degrees the wrong way. Very strange.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x x\\
I've just parked up.\\How did you sleep?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Silly little robot, no need to turn that aggressively. Hope you manage to figure out some kind of solution there.\\
Are you up anything before Lester picks you up?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Slept ok, got up on the night and woke up 15 mins before my alarm.\\
It will get figured out. Has to.\\Not doing much really. Will get breakfast and have to get ready. Might try and sneak in a bit of work. Will be a bit of hurry and wait again today.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hope you have a good day.\\
Still swimming later?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, I'd still like to go. How about you?\\
Hope today is as good as it can be given the situation. Pass on my love to Matt and Michelle please\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I certainly need to go and see what the swimming is like.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Does that mean you'll come with?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yes, will find my stuff once I get back this afternoon\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okie doke!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope everything went as well as it could\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah it went well. Weird being there but good to learn about someone.\\
Currently at the pub. I’ve no idea how the afternoon is going to go.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's Matt doing?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Seems to be doing well or as well as you’d expect.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's good.\\
I'll let you know when I'm leaving work\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm just about to head home. He are you doing?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m still at the pub. You could pick me up? Or I can get home and go from there. I’d like to go with you but it might not be the best idea for me to swim.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have you been drinkies? :beaming-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
Bub if you want to stay that's perfectly alright, I don't mind going by myself. But equally if you want to come with I can pick you up\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Let me know\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: A pick up would be good as more drinking will be very bad. I think we are about to walk back to Matt’s place. It’s a bit fluid at the moment\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. I'll come get you. Let me know where you are. I just got home\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: When are you leaving? We are currently at the lady Spencer.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The Le De Spencers (Downley Common, High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire HP13 5YQ): \url{https://foursquare.com/v/4ba63edbf964a520b73e39e3}\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: If you move on before I text you let me know\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm leaving in 2. Still in the pub?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep at pub\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Will be there in 10\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Omg I just looked at myself in the mirror. Why didn't you tell me I looked deranged this whole time :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Erm, you just looked like you swam. That was all.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have you had dinner?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just reheating it now. Phones home to talk to mum and dad\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are they alright?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: As ok as they can be. Dad says he is ok and he seems to have accepted the inevitable of what is happening.  Not that it helps waiting. I’m going to go with him on Friday to see Nan on the morning.\\
Her kidney function isn’t right and she won’t eat or drink.\\You can’t make people help themselves\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I'm so sorry. Your dad must be really feeling it all. Hopefully he'll talk to one of you at some point.\\
Good that you're going with him\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: He says he doesn’t need anyone to go with him. Which I think is true but he won’t say directly that it would be nice.\\
Probably going to be rough but we will see.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: As long as you're with him.\\
The not asking for help runs in the family doesn't it\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah it does.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just know I'm here for whatever you need. Just need to say :red-heart::red-heart:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm tucked in and proper knackered :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\

Happy 6 months :red-heart:\\I'm okay. I can definitely feel I went swimming.\\How are you feeling?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m ok. Bit tired but that’s about it. Just about to go to my shit spin class and then a little workout after.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope the spin class is not too shit. Enjoy gym !\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Spin wasn’t too bad today. Couple of new people and Joseph couldn’t talk much.\\
Peer pressure took over and we  (Toria) went for a coffee instead of the gym. Need to try and find a date for another dinner with them. At there place to see the progress on their house.\\Hope work goes well today. Smash that training.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Glad the class wasn't too shit.\\
How's Toria doing?\\Thank you :red-heart: what are you up to?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: At the moment she is doing really well. Work is going ok and she looks to be getting a pay rise. She hit a new deadlift PB this week and is generally getting stronger now that she sees Hannah twice a week plus her running is going well. Although she still doesn’t like running. Dan has made really good progress on the house and all of their planning approvals have been done. So “just” the work to do now.\\
She might come with me to see you at SDR on Saturday.\\I’m just about to have some breakfast and take a crack at some work. Think I’ll go for a walk at lunch as well.\\I completely forgot about the chicken for tonight :face-with-diagonal-mouth: so it’s all still frozen solid.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah that's good, glad she's doing better.\\
You can take the chicken out now and it will be alright\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: How many chicken breasts should I get. 4?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 3 might be enough, depending on how big they are\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's brilliant!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Right back at ya :red-heart:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: what in the middle one?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Green tea\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: water, Tea AND Coffee?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: One for taste, one for hydration and one for energy :woman-shrugging-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: coffee has taste and energy.\\
In answer to your question I think more weird than ADHD in the given scenario.\\If it was Water, Fizzy drink, Hot drink. Then yes.\\2 hot drinks! madness\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well the green tea is lukewarm\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: it gets WORSE :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
TEPID drinks\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I like ice tea\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: Awesome, of course they have to be goldens.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How many dogs have they bought in?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 3. The two goldens and miniature poodle. Was just showing the owner the pic of Eva and Lexie,:smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Is it a weekly or monthly thing they do?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's just this week because it's Mental Health Week\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-rolling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's work gone today?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So far it has gone reasonably well. I finished the reading a bit quicker than expected so I am currently answering the required assignment question. I might switch it up and try to get the whole assignment done this week (its due next Thursday). Then I can fully switch back to cosmology next week to do the coding work and start revising.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That sounds good. Well done.\\
I'm just about to leave. I am so hurty today :confused-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: :disappointed-face: I'm sorry. Delayed reaction to the run, swimming, just a lot of sitting or stress about stuff?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: you have been mega active over the last few days. The weekend especially\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think so. A combination of all the things. I don't think I have been particularly stressed (or at least less than usual) but I've done a lot of stuff. And still have the headache from yesterday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You definitely have been active. Bit of rest this evening can only help. Not fun that the swimming headache remained\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have been too excited to have brain space :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just feeding the cat and then will go to the shop and to you\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I forgot your bits at home so have to go back\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Home!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done. As always, I had fun this evening.\\
I hope the leg pain goes away tomorrow\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I do love spending time with you just doing life :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you doing anything before bed?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I thought about it but no. Im knackered. Just watching a bit of you tube and will go to bed\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's a good plan :smiling-face: I'm going to take the meds and potter into bed\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x\\
Thank you.\\Did you sleep well?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I slept ok. Once I made it to bed. Somehow fell asleep for 5 minutes on the sofa :man-facepalming:\\
How are the legs today?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, you had a nap starter.\\
Legs are still sore. Definitely the run. Have a good session with Hannah\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was your morning?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was ok. Still at mums will message more details later\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Back home and eating food.\\
A pretty good visit to see Nan. Manage to talk to the doctor and get some info.\\They need to do a heart scan. They are on a bit of a knife edge trying to get her kidney’s working while balancing high blood pressure and possibly something else with her heart.\\I think her whole body is starting to shut down.\\Then back to mum’s with some serious and surreal conversations about my parents possibly buying my brother a commercial property for his business. Can fill you in that tomorrow.\\How was your day? How was seeing your work friend?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That sounds like a big day for you. But I'm glad the visit was good. How was your dad?\\
Definitely tell me everything tomorrow :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\Day's been good. Haven't seen my friend yet, she's just on the bus over, we'll be having dinner I thank.\\What will you be up to tonight?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Dad seems pretty good. I think he is over the initial shock and said Nan looked a lot better today but he also seems well aware of the reality.\\
They both had a clean on Nans house yesterday and discovered more stuff she had been hiding. Seems like she was doing as well as we expected and then maybe the last 2 - 3 weeks has gone down hill real fast.\\Want to try and finish my assignment tonight and do some robot stuff. We will see\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Busy night for you! Hope the assignment goes well.\\
We've gone to the Lebanese in town\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Enjoy. I did have the read Lebanese twice before I read it correctly :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy: it was so yum.\\
How's work going?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think I have finished my assignment. A bunch of faff busy work\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's good! Well done. Robot bits now?\\
Have you had dinner?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, going to tackle some robot stuff now. I ate when I got home. Didn't really have lunch other than a donut at Mum and Dads house. Messed of the protein intake for the day.\\
Other than the food being good how was dinner? Company wise\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You can restart protein tomorrow. One day will be fine . It was a busy, big day for you. Make sure you also rest, because you definitely haven't done much of that today.\\
It was really good. We caught up, she told me all the goss :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\Also there was loads of armed police and helicopter in town just as we were walking back to the car :face-with-open-mouth:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Its always kicking off in Wycombe.\\
You can fill me in on the goss tomorrow. I'm probably aiming to get to the dog rescue between 1:30 and 2. Toria will be joining.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki, everything should be in full swing by then. Hopefully the weather holds\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: hope so. If anything I think it will rain while at park run\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you going black park tomorrow?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: yep, Cally is picking me up at 8\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah good! Hope it's a good one\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I remember it being a nice course but that was well over a year ago now. Weirdly we pretty much drove past it today on the way to the hospital\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: God it's warm tonight\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, i wonder if i should test out the AC unit or at least get it ready this weekend\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Probably a good idea\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: All tucked in now.\\
How did the robot go?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night, hope you sleep well x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: The robot has mis behaved. I'm back at the start. Almost. I can either get it to drive in a straight line but not turn correctly OR it can turn but not drive straight.\\
Its something to do with the encoder signal and how it processes rotation.\\All confusing as this problem shouldn't exist.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night x x x x x x x x x x x\\
Love You :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That sounds very complicated. Hope you manage to sort something xx\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
I slept okay, woke up a couple of times. I'm still hurty.\\Did you sleep well or was it too hot already?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hurt in general, the legs or yes to both?\\
Slept ok. It was warm but not crazy. Will set up the AC today. That will make the weather change :grinning-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: A little yes to both, but definitely feeling the legs more.\\
How was your session with Hannah yesterday?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Long time to hurt from a run.\\
Running really is the worst :loudly-crying-face:\\Session was good. Hannah started it by saying it was a risky session because we did sumos. Which seem cursed for me. The last 3 times I’ve done them something has been wrong. Did ok though.\\3x6x150kg as the top set. Pretty pleased with it and know I could have gone more. Just nice to actually finish it. Also did hamstring stuff on the slightly less evil machine.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well you know my doms are much longer because of fibro so that's why I'm still hurting.\\
Oh well done! Those are good sets!\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know, just seem like these ones are sticking around longer than most.\\
What time are you heading off to SDR?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's probably because it was a really hard run for me.\\
I'll be heading over around 9.30.\\Btw, parking might be at a premium depending how busy it gets. I'll be parking in the medical centre and walking over\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Earlier than I thought. Good luck with the setup.\\
Thanks. I’m still not even sure where it is :face-with-tears-of-joy: will see what it’s like when I get there.\\I want to see Eddie and or any other big dogs they have. I guess the dogs aren’t going to actually be on show though.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I don't actually know if their dogs are going to be out. But people should be bringing their own ones I think.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I imagine it would be a lot of stress for the dogs so they will be kept away.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I'd think so too\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Back home.\\
Pretty good run. Really nice course.\\Do I need cash for SDR? Should get there just before 2\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh well done!\\
Yes please for the cash xx\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm just walking back to my car\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s sooner than expected. Well done.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I just started packing up and left the last bits to others. Are you home yet?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, only been back 10 mins. Just about to venture into the loft.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to go home, potter, shower and I'll text you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sounds good. You deserve a sit down.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just getting dressed, will feed the cato and can be in my way. Shall I stop for the naan or did you pick it up?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I got the naan\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. I can leave in 2 if that's good for you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: that works for me\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: See you soon\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Home. And saw two badgers on the side of your road!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Alive?\\
The wine biscuits are not good :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: the white wine especially. I’m not even sure what the taste is. Mostly air crunch sugar and then something off (which has to be the wine). The red ones are slightly better.\\They would be better without the the wine\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
You don't have to eat them :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And yes, both badgers were alive\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I had to try them at least\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well yea. Going forward I mean :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: I know. I think they will find there way to the bin.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't blame you :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Pottered all the way to bed and all tucked in\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done. As always I really enjoyed spending the evening  with you.\\
Night x x x x x x x x x\\Hope you sleep well and have a nice lie in. Tell the cat shhhh.\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Me too. It's always very lovely spending time with you.\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x\\
Nothing did I don't think. I just woke up naturally. How about you? I thought you'd be still asleep.\\I'm actually feeling alright :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I had planned to be asleep but my body decided to wake up. Better I guess than being scared awake by the alarm.\\
That’s good.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: What’s your plan for the morning?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh really just pottering. Shower, hair, get ready slowly. Just an easy morning. What are you doing?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Going to get food and coffee from downstairs and then want to write up this robot problem I have. Doing that will help me fix it or I can then send it to the group for ideas.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope that goes well and some ideas pop up for you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Something is flipped the wrong way. I think an error value somewhere is negative when it should be positive.\\
It will be something simple\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It tends to be, doesn't it. Hopefully it becomes obvious\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did we say 12:30 pick up?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes we did\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just checking. Morning has not gone to plan at all. Had a hard disk sudden give up on my computer so it’s all fucked :man-facepalming:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no! What can be done?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: New drive already ordered and be delivered today. Then it should just be a case of restoring it all. At the moment my computer is very confused that the drive is missing.\\
Massive faff but should just be a case of connecting it up and then getting it all downloaded from backup.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh at least it's a reasonably quick fix I guess. But what a faff. Sorry you're having to deal with that today\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Could well do without it. I absolutely hate it when my computer isn’t working and it just eats time.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I get that. But it will be fixed!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, it will get fixed. Just loses at least a day. Always something\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: On the way\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Enjoy vroom vroom. Did your package arrive?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thanks. No delivery yet. Probably be very close to 10pm. Will need to resist staying up till 2am fixing it all.\\
Did you get your package ok?\\Full potter mode?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes please! Go to bed at reasonable hour :face-with-tears-of-joy: you do have an early spin.\\
Yup, it was all super quick. Just hoovered, laundry and sorting out my pills for next week :person-light-skin-tone-white-hair:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Nice to get things sorted though.\\
Vroom vroom :racing-car:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It is :smiling-face: I like how I had a lovely day, and still cleaned and got stuff ready without stress.\\
How's vroom vroom? Any safety cars?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m really pleased for you. This is what I was hoping it would be like for you. Actually getting a 2 day weekend. Long may it continue.\\
Vroom is ok. Not a lot happening. No crashes yet. Fucking tyres are lasting forever so no real pit stop action either. Only half way. So will see what happens.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
Hopefully it gets more exciting in the 2nd half\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did it end up any better?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sort of. Needed a few more laps but the first race this year max didn’t easy win. First and second was separated by a second.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oooh that must have been at least a little exciting.\\
Are you already tinkering with the hard drive?\\I'm all tucked in and will go to sleep. I can't even believe that I managed a whole face routine too today. Long may it continue.\\Night night x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hard disk isn’t here yet. I’ll probably just go to bed after it arrives and just deal with it all tomorrow.\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
Oh babs, that is so frustrating.\\There is a little electronics shop on desborough behind Lidl. I don't know if they would have something like that though. It's such a crap situation. Maybe ordering one for tomorrow is the better idea.\\Can you do any work without computer? I'm sorry you're having to deal with this\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think I can do some stuff but not what I want to do. I guess it’s better it’s happened this week and not any closer to when my exam is.\\
I might drive to curry’s and see what they have. Their website is pretty poor.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That might be a good idea. Hopefully they'll have what you need\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was spin?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Boring. Jospeh covered the class. Just about to have my session with Hannah.\\
I am knackered today. Took ages to get to sleep and then early this morning because something woke me up.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh boo. Joseph ruining a Monday.\\
It's probably your brain thinking about everything. You did have a big week. Try to take today easy.\\Hope your session with Hannah is good\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Definitely the brain is thinking. It right on the edge at the moment of blowing up. Really need my computer fixed.\\
Will try a somewhat easy day. Got house jobs to do and cooking to do. I’ll go swimming and get the laptop setup as a backup to do some uni work.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm sorry there are so many things happening at the same time.\\
What can I do to help?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I don’t think there is anything you can do but thank you.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was your session with Hannah?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was pretty good. Had to deload a bit. Tiredness not helping but good to do overhead press again.\\
How’s your day going?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah well done. Glad you had a good session.\\
I've been in meetings all morning and just had lunch.\\I am so incredibly fatigued today it's unreal though\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh that no fun. Hopefully lunch and a reset will help\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your afternoon going?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Shopping has arrived and I’ve had lunch. Just about to start cooking dinner for the slow cooker. Got some clothes to put away then will set up the laptop for some work and the tutorial\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Busy afternoon! Hope it all goes well.\\
Did you order another harddrive?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, I ordered it this morning. Annoying as that’s what I should have done yesterday.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You couldn't have know it wasn't going to arrive. Be nice to my boyfriend, please\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I am trying.\\
Toria old flat is back on the market after only 6 months\\\url{https://www.rightmove.co.uk/properties/148185731}\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That is so cute!\\
And so pricey\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was a nice flat. Very expensive for a 2 bed. The character seems to add a lot of money.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh cottages always go for more because they're cottages\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Going to risk seeing if I can swim and get back in time for my tutorial and eat.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you going to westhorpe?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Enjoy. Just got home and will need to lay down\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, just going to do the 400 and see how long it all takes\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Enjoy the nap\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was the swim?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: A bit urgh. Had a headache before that is now worse. Everything felt very tight. Forgot a swim cap :man-facepalming:\\
Probably not the best after doing arms as they keep nearly cramping.\\Lovely day though. Water is perfect, other than the fluff on it. Just a rough swim.\\Now rapidly trying to finish off dinner and eat before tutorial\\How are you?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh sorry it wasn't ideal. Hopefully Wednesday will be better.\\
I didn't nap, just lay there. Then had the phone call only to be told the supervisor was on holiday so can't tell me anything. Rescheduled to Thursday.\\I'm going to pop to the shop to get some fruit. Do you need anything?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thanks but I’m all good.\\
That’s a real pain about your call. Such a faff when you get yourself ready for it,\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah it is.\\
Hope the tutorial is good. What is it on?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: They are sprinting through previous exam questions. Will have to get the recording and slowly go through some of it.\\
I think there is some reading between the lines to be done one what the tutors are telling us. Already seen a bit hint on the forum on where we should focus\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah that's good. Hopefully it's helpful\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Helpful \/ terrifying \/ scary\\
All the same :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: When you go through it from the recording it will make more sense. And you can do it however many times you want\/need\\
How can I help over the next few weeks while you're concentrating on exams?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: it will make sense when i go over it. Just got to get the reps in.\\
I really dont know that there is much you can help with. I just need to go through and do stuff.\\Will have to spend time at the weekends as well and just chip away a bit at a time.\\Some big hints again at the end. Telling us to use the specimine paper and look at all the examples in the book.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know I can't necessarily help you revise but if there's anything I can do to make the next few weeks easier please tell me.\\
It's good they gave you some hints. Hopefully they'll keep it up for the rest of the tutorials\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: If I think of anything I’ll let you know.\\
Now I can just sit and watch a bit of TV before bed.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good plan. Rest a little\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What did you end up watching?\\
I'm all tucked in. Had dinner, made lunch for tomorrow, and even did my face routine. Has this time always been here?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: As in you now have more time?\\
Yes it’s always been here. The not taking an hour to get home from work helps :grinning-face:\\I finished watching the big short. Somewhat scary really but really well done. Dumb money is similar but not as good.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, I seem to have more time :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Oh I started watching that once ages ago and never finished\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to say night night now. Hope you sleep better tonight x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: More time is good.\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x\\
Ha, i completely get that feeling! I need a day like that.\\I'm tired, didn't sleep well at all. Don't know why tbh\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh that’s no good. It was hot. Were you spiraling about anything?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Bo I don't think so. I think I'm just flaring a little\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Tell it no.\\
I know it doesn’t work that way but you never know.\\Hopefully work is too hard today. Not too many meetings.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, I do wish I did work that way.\\
Thank you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\Hope the spin is not too crap\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was so boring. Was a fun bit near the end but time seems to stand still. It’s done though.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you forget paired as well yesterday?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's done and now you don't need to leave the house :partying-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Uuumm, yes, but because I had such a long streak it froze it so I didn't lose it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I do need to go to my brothers tonight after my tutorial so we can all talk about this commercial building thing but I do have the whole day at least.\\
Just hoping my Amazon delivery is somewhat early.\\Hope you have a good day.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah yes, the big talk.\\
What's your plan for the day?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Bit of cooking this morning, revision. Think I’ll start by reading all the chapter summaries and noting anything interesting in a quick reference I’m making. Plus making the computer work once Amazon arrives. Maybe a walk at lunch.\\
You up to anything this evening?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That sounds like a good, productive day :smiling-face:\\
I've got flashcards and bits if they would be any use to you?\\I'm going to see if Michelle is around, I haven't properly caught up with her in ages\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thanks but I should be ok. I don’t need to actually memorise anything as the exam is open book. So it’s just a case of getting everything I might need into a place where I can find it fast. You have time to look up stuff but no time to work anything out if you don’t already know it.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah alright!\\
Oh btw, can you send me Heidi's contact\/website? I wore my necklace to work and everyone wants to know :smiling-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have asked her if she has a website\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your day going?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s going ok. Been for a walk. Done some revision and now cooking lunch. Feeling a bit funny from the swim yesterday.\\
I remember how much swimming seems to mess with my head. Still got that swim headache. Don’t think it helped that the cap was tight.\\Still no Amazon delivery and I even passed a guy on my walk.\\How’s your day going?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh what do you mean funny?\\
What does the app say?\\Super busy. Literally in meetings all day again\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s arrived!\\
Just funny. Not dizzy but dizzy with a bit of a headache.\\Proper corporate girly\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Woo hoo. Are you already tinkering with it?\\
Sorry you're feeling weird. The air pressure has really changed since yesterday and that sometimes gives me a heavy body\/head.Have you had enough water today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Already installed and got data being restored to it. Not only do I need to organise a lot of my house but I clearly am storing a bunch of crap on my computer that just isn't needed.\\
Just about on the water. Am trying to drink more\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah well done! So productive\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i mean i should be revising but the quicker this is fixed the better\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But you do also have a tutorial later\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: very true. It on the other topic so it might fry my brain. Hopefully they drop a few hints as well.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully they will.\\
Computer sorted?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just about. Waiting for more stuff to download but seems to be 90\%\\
Will put it all back together and hang it under the desk tomorrow morning and then it will be done.\\You back home?\\You seeing Michelle?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just parked up at home. Went to meet Michelle at John Lewis for a tea :smiling-face: definitely bath tonight\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That sounds like a good idea.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have you been up to much before your tutorial?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Nope, had dinner and a bit of TV. Now to see if the brain will work.\\
Bathed or bathing?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Brain will work. Sending big brain vibes.\\
Just running the bath. I pottered\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was it?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hard. Just posted questions and then gave us time to answer them. Not very interactive.\\
At my brothers now crunching more numbers\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope the conversation goes well.\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
Oh no! And on your lay in day too. Did you sleep okay\\I'm still really fatigued and didn't sleep well. Don't know what's going on.\\How was your time with brother and parents last night?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Slept ok just had to wake up for a wee. :man-facepalming:\\
That is really strange. The air pressure is different. Maybe that’s what’s made my head funny instead of swimming (I’ll blame the swimming)\\Or is the cat waking you up.\\Been a while since you’ve had trouble sleeping.\\Have you changed the timings of any of your drugs? (Just a thought)\\Hopefully a WFH day tomorrow will help.\\Our “meeting” :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: went well. Easier to fill in all the details in person but at the moment they are moving forward with buying the place. They have a way of making it fair. So I could be owning half of a commercial building very soon.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh boo. Don't get up\\
It is but the air pressure and humidity could definitely be the culprit. And not loads of rest.\\No, cat is sleeping through the night and I am actually waking him up in the morning. Drugs are the same. Hopefully it will\\Oh that's good that it went well. Look at you Mr fancy pants with his commercial property :smiling-face:\\I'm not going to swim tonight - cold and rainy. I could come for a quick cuddle and catch up after work today if you'd like?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: All very strange then, for your sleep. You know what you might need to try. You might need to get the vibrator out and give that a go. See if it helps with the sleep.\\
That could be the new thing I tell people when they ask what I do “oh, I’m a commercial property investor” much more dickhead than student. :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\That’s a great idea I’d really like that. I wasn’t really feeling the swim without the weather and the timings is super tight with my tutorial but i really want to see you. So this works out perfectly :red-heart:\\Think I’ll go Monday maybe Sunday if I can stomach getting up that early.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Brilliant. I'll let you know when I'm leaving. Just got to the office. More meetings :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
What's your plan for today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Got to get up. Eat.\\
Put my computer back together and mounted under the desk. Then it’s just revision.  Will finish reading chapter summaries and make notes on those then try the sample paper and get that written up. I need to submit my assignment so that I don’t forget.\\Will be nice, I don’t have to leave the house today. Rain has ruined a walk.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good productive day ahead for you. Hope it's good :red-heart:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How are the meetings going?\\
Assignment has been submitted.\\First pass of summaries is done and the computer is back under the desk. Think it all back up and running\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh well done!\\
Meetings are alright. Just a lot of them\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just leaving. See you in a bit\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well, that tutorial was a little bit like trying to drink from a fire hose.\\
Did you successfully hunt for dinner?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Was it at least a little helpful?\\
Somehow, I had some pasta\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was helpful. Just a lot to take in.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you found something to do?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm watching some telly and crocheting. But I'm feeling like I should be productive with my extra time\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you doing anything else tonight?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Crocheting is being productive and you are allowed to relax.\\
You don’t always have to be doing something. You can take a breath. You completely ignored my suggestion this morning for what you could do to try and sleep better :squinting-face-with-tongue:\\Just playing a few games with Matt to try and reset the mind.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know! It just feels like I could be doing better things :face-with-tears-of-joy: I don't know. I think my body and brain are very confused about not being in constant state of stress.\\
Ah nice! Enjoy .Hope they're not terrible :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\Oh and my sticky notes arrived :beaming-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: The brain is probably confused because your used to always having to work.\\
Oh fancy sticky notes :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I think it just doesn't know what to do. I think it will take a little while for my nervous system to calm down\\
They are so fancy\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It will take a while to adjust. You just need to remember that you can do what you want now in the evening and not have to worry about work.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's such a foreign feeling\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: All tucked in. How are the games?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night, sleep well x x x x x x x x x x\\
Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Games are ok. Not to fussed today. Just something to reset the mind.\\

Night night x x x x x x x x x\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00017654-GIF-2024-05-23-06-21-20.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
I was still quite restless but did sleep a little better.\\Organising :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\Are you off to crappy spin class?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep then going to do a little gym session after. I’m hoping the class feel shorter given it only 30 minutes but no doubt it will drag on.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You’re up early for a WFH day?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully it's not too bad and the gym sesh is good\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah, I woke up before my alarm :confused-face: I'll have a slow morning I guess\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I suppose it does give you time to do some more pottering :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha. Exactly!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was spin and gym?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That was odd I got both of those messages at the same time.\\
Spin was shit. 3rd class in a row where he wasn’t on the bike. Just very mentally boring.\\Gym after was ok. Nothing special. Just messing around on bench trying to see where I might be going wrong on the technique. Few sets at 90-95.\\Somehow have lost 45 minutes.\\Going to have a stab at the sample paper today.\\How are the meetings going?\\Somewhat random thought. Maybe you need some sort of cooling mat for the bed? And a heavier weighted blanket.\\Did you look anymore at the pillow you were going to get.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, it was showing as undelivered, don't know why.\\
Joseph needs to pull his finger out, those classes haven't been good forever.\\Well done on the bench! Those are brilliant sets!\\I did zoom training this morning, meetings in the afternoon.\\I think I do need to look for a heavier weighted blanket and I haven't gotten that pillow yet. On my list.\\In terms of cooling, I haven't really been too warm. No more socks and just a t-shirt now.\\Good luck with the paper\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Get the pillow sorted.\\
"just" a t-shirt :eyes::eyes::eyes::eyes:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And knickers!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oooooh\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That does look good\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Takes a little while to bake but I’ll make it again. Somehow stays together.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Steph had to cancel tonight so will go straight after work\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That's a shame and easier all at the same time.\\
Did you counselling session get moved to today as well or did I make that up\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup the call is at 4. I don't think it will be a session per se\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Guess when the therapy group has next availability\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: August?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How did you know\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: sometimes I smart :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: plus its the easiest question I have tried to answer today :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How did the paper go?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: GO! i'm still drowning in it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh bubs! Sending strength!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How long should it take?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: not sure if i'm doing it right but I'm trying the question. Seeing the gaps in my notes so updating the notes. Working out how to search the books fast\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's a good approach\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: you have 3 hours for the exam. I;ve been proper on it for at least 2 and I am just at the end of question 2 on an 8 question paper\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's okay. You are taking notes etc\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: sort of expected this to happen and resisting looking at the answers until I've done them.\\
I am starting to get a sense of what they are doing. Which does match with the HUGE hint they gave us.\\I did find a typo though (in the exam)\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: God they need better editors <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: in fairness I can take days over this exam as long as the real one is fast\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's good\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Exactly.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm off to the gym\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I dont think the rules are the same across the modules. On my other one they have said they have used English professors to review the questions as well as other astronomers. Making it clear to us that EVERY word is important and there for a reason.\\
On this module it looks like some piece of work I might have sent to a client\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: have fun at the gym\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00017696-GIF-2024-05-23-16-18-19.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh. Discrepancies in modules shouldn't really be happening. Weird\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :eyes: 3 records!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't even know what they are :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: how do you get a 6 at the end\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: a nice easy session then\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hmmmm, I don't know\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah lat pull\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That was a longer list than I was expecting\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Felt good though. But so fucking hot in there and busy\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s either freezing cold or boiling.  Nothing else\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've never been cold there :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Paper going?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't forget to start dinner so you don't rush before tutorial :purple-heart:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Reheating it now.\\
Full tears over the paper\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Is it super hard?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Cannot even get the same answer as an example in the book.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Make sure you go over your notes tomorrow and then try it again\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Only when you don’t know the answer :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ve asked on the forum\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Got to switch topics now. Brain will be gone\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What's the tutorial on?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Astrophysics exam prep session 1\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh fun\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not really much else you can say to that :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Some of it is fun. There was a moment earlier in the week where I saw something and knew it had to be true because of the science behind it.\\
All these little incremental things adding up to prove what we know or at least place bounds on it.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That is cool!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What am I having for dinner?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What are you having!\\
Erm, some sort of fish?\\Something else to use up feeezer food?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It will be freezer roulette\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm watching Laura's fight\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: how is she doing\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: She's on at 7.30\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Almost as much fun\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope it's helpful\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: how did she do?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: She fought so so well. But her injured shoulder gave out in round 2 so there was stoppage :confused-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ouch. So was the fight stopped?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, she lost the fight because of it being stopped <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was the tutorial?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh. That’s a shame. Not the way you’d want to lose a fight.\\
It was pretty good. Lots of good info. Just don’t need it yet. If that makes sense.\\I’m not sure if it’s better or worse both exams are so similar.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah, she will be gutted which is so understandable.\\
That's good. You can go over it when you need it. Do they record them?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah it’s all recorded. Got the files from it so just need to go through and make up my own notes like I am for this current one.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you find something to do with all your free time tonight?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Brilliant plan!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No, I've just been rotting\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It could be called relaxing\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahahah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have you been up to much after the tutorial?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just playing some games in a boring way to unlock stuff I need. Good distraction\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good! I'm just pottering my way into bed\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll be doing the same soon enough\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Took me long enough!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night, sweet dreams x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha.\\
\section*{Friday $24\textsuperscript{th}$}
Night night x x x x x x x x\\Hope you sleep better.\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00017759-GIF-2024-05-24-06-40-35.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
Yeah, I was up before my alarm but stayed in bed so managed to fall asleep for a bit more. Super restless again.\\What are you doing with Hannah today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s got to be weather. I think the light is waking me up early as well.\\
Today’s session was really good. Some pull ups that weren’t terrible. Some arm stuff and deadlifts. Back to 2x5x170.\\Now for food, shower and more revision. Plus a bit of housework before Ross arrives.\\What’s your day look like?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It has to. I was so restless I woke up at one point on the other side of the bed, upside down, curled around the cat :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Ah well done! You are getting back to your sets. My strong manly man :smiling-face:\\Oh what are you up to with Ross?\\I'm doing training now, then have a few meetings. I did manage quite a bit of work yesterday so taking it easy :grimacing-face: which is such a weird thing to say for me\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00017763-GIF-2024-05-24-09-49-26.mp4>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Definitely need to mix something up with the sleep. That all week of bad sleep. On the positive work is soo much better now that you don’t appear to be crawling around on the floor in tears.\\
Slowly getting back to being strong although felt weak this week. Lack of sleep I think.\\Just going into town. Dinner and some drinks. Hopefully I won’t be too knackered and or hungover tomorrow. I haven’t seen Ross this year so will be good to see him.\\Bad planning as really we should have done tomorrow as Trilogy actually has an event on tomorrow that looked funny.\\Hopefully in a few more months or at least next year we can do our trip to vegas.\\Good luck with the training.\\That’s a great thing to be able to say. You can flex the work. This is what it’s meant to be like. Plus Fridays are a silly day to work anyway.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I think I need new pillows and a bigger weighted blanket.\\
It is. I can definitely pace myself a little better, but I'm thinking it might be a lunchtime nap kinda day.\\Sounds like a good evening. Do you know where you're going eating?\\I still can't believe you go to trilogy :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\Good luck with revision :purple-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Lunchtime nap is a good idea. Get that private meeting Booked!\\
Probably going to eat in Heidrun or maybe mad squirrel.\\It’s not like I’m in trilogy every week :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: only go with Ross and we have maybe been 5 times. Just one of the few places you can hear loud music. Although the truly sad thing is that now my Monday spin class plays some great music and is loud.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha it's there.\\
I've never been in there :face-with-tears-of-joy: always looks like a student night.\\And that is not a sad thing! It's 2 good things together - music and exercise :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: There are a lot of student but also we are now the weird old people that I remember seeing in the club 20 years ago.\\
The vegas clubs are a bit different. Much more old people.\\Although I’m not convinced that many student go climbing anymore. Not locally at least. Feels like this generation of student don’t do it as much.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Climbing?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Clubbing\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Autocorrect\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: They probably don’t do\\
Much climbing either\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But yes, young people are less going outy then we were\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Nice. That will last a little while then\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It will!\\
I'll bring some of them over\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I wonder if its worth trying the chickpea one in the slow cooker to see if it makes a difference\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hmm I don't know. Because you do get a lot of flavour from frying the spices\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: true. Maybe fry them first and then add in. Seems a long way to make something that only takes a few minutes anyway. Chicken is better in the slow cooker\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah. We could try the butter chicken one in slow cooker\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I just tried to hang my washing up in my fridge :man-facepalming:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh wow! I will come cheer you on\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
The revision brain.\\I overslept my nap alarm and woke up exactly as my next meeting was starting :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: So you woke up exactly on time\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: has the nap helped?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I was very confused :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's the revision going?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00017790-GIF-2024-05-24-15-01-05.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's the high level exams - they expect you to know the stuff so put tune pressure on.\\
I know it's taking ages but that's how it is. Revision is always labour and time heavy. But you are doing so well with this. Slow and steady wind the race\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What time is Ross coming?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: sometime after 5. His office is in Wycombe and he should be leaving at 5\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah great. Hope you have a good evening! Text me when you can\/are home xxx\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: will do. Are you doing anything this evening?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not really. Just sorting out the bathroom and will think of dinner soon\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you successfully hunt dinner?\\
All packed for tomorrow?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I did.\\
And I'll pack tomorrow morning, only need a change of clothes.\\How's your evening?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: And your weighted blanket and a good pillow.\\
All good so far. So good catching up. At Heidrun just finished dinner\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nice! Enjoy it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope you're having a good time.\\
I'm just in bed.\\Night night x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\Let me know you got home safe.\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just got home.  I music in town so put it on from YouTube.\\
\section*{Saturday $25\textsuperscript{th}$}
Night night x x x x x\\Hope you finally sleep ok.\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That should have said no music in town.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00017804-GIF-2024-05-25-08-07-04.mp4>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ross already left. No idea what time. He said he would leave early so he could get back.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x\\
That is an early wake up. When did you go to sleep?\\I am definitely not set, just getting into shower :face-with-tears-of-joy: should be leaving around 11.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was last night?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: End of month but very quiet in town last night. Good fun to see Ross again.\\
Some weirdo guy in the squirrel that both me and Ross were thinking of telling to fuck off but we just moved instead. Just a local who is there all the time that is unnecessary loud when talking. Heidrun was sort of busy and we sat outside, with the bugs!\\Made it to the falcon for a drink as well. Really just to see. It was almost sad. Not busy at all.\\We did wonder what the youth actually do now. I don’t think it was ever a good idea that you had to go out in the evening and drink in order to spend time with your friends but when your 20 you don’t actually have anything to talk about. So I wonder were there go.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Later leaving than I thought. So is everyone arriving at 2pm then?\\
How much pottering could you have left to do:rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sounds like a good evening. Were you drunkies?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah, aim is to get there 2\/2.30. bev is arriving at 3.30\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m not even sure I drink as much as I did at the funeral. Maybe it was 5 pints. So no not really. You might have thought so though.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you showered already? I didn’t even check the camera yet\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Of course. I'm efficient\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: A 7 minute shower!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just needed to wash\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Or I shower slow\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m not sure on my timings for later so spud might get his dinner a little early but I’m aiming for 5\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's perfectly alright, I'm very grateful for you popping in :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What are you up to today?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So far I’ve gone back to bed. Got to cut the grass and I want to try a bit more revision I’m sure I’m missing something as well. Then out to dinner with Lester later.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What’s the activity your doing this afternoon? I assume it’s activity dinner and then out out\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah nice. Where you're off to with Lester?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Actually no out out tonight. They will be going tomorrow I think. Candle making in the afternoon and then dinner and chill I think\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think it’s the curry centre currently I’m not really sure of the times or the location:rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
That could be nice. I forgot they just have Monday as well so can go mental tomorrow.\\Don’t forget ear plugs and blanket\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Is it just the two of you?\\
Yeah. I'm really anxious about going and staying to be honest. A) I don't know anyone apart from Bev B) the sleeping situation\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Meeting up with some old work people as well.\\
It’s never fun sharing a room with people. Even if you know them. The worrying will only make it worse though.\\Good practice at least to test out another sleeping situation. First night in a new place is always a bit crap. You never know the bed could be rock hard\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have both a really good air mattress and a shit one if you want?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you, there are beds so we'll see\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Or you could sleep in the bath. I’m hoping if you can block the noise and have the weighted blanket you’ll be ok\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think I'm going to get on the road soon. There seems to be terrible traffic on M25 :face-with-rolling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Of course it is. School holiday traffic I guess. Good luck.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've stopped at services. Still hour and half to go\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done. Is the traffic awful?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah it's slow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've been thinking on the way. I think I'll drive back up tonight - half my face is now numb and I'm in a lot of pain. Will do the bits and then get back on the road when they go to bed\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sounds like a plan. I’m guessing you got yourself worked up over the thought of the whole thing\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Maybe. But I've been low key flaring all week and haven't slept so I'm guessing it just caught up with me\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The sleep really does ruin everything or the lack of.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Bloody fibro ruins everything\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I hope you have fun at least. Sorry you have to suffer for it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you. I'm just pissed off with my body\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s a shame the new drugs don’t seem to be helping in this situation or are they?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Do you have the new drugs to try out tomorrow if it’s still bad\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They are. Which kind of makes it worse. I always get scared when my face goes numb\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Shit ... I forgot\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I bet that is scary.\\
Forgot drugs for today or to pick up the new ones?\\Can I pick them up?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Pick up from pharmacy :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
Completely left my brain after the GP said she'll only release one set\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't want to put you out\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It only down the road, assuming they are open and I can pick them up\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think they close at 2 today\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Are they ready to be picked up? Send me the info\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: They close at 3\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I can pick them up if they are ready\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Lucia Endrodyova, 23\/01\/87\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you so much\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to get back on the road. Will let you know when I arrive\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh thank you :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: didn't realise they had the old prescription too.\\
Just arrived. Fucking country lanes :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Is that the drugs they couldn’t find last time around?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: oh, proper cottage thingy\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's massive.\\
Hope you have a good evening x\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you bubs. Enjoy your evening :red-heart:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your evening?\\
Just getting on the road back\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Going well. Nice to catch up with people. Just got to Heidrun for another drink.\\
\section*{Sunday $26\textsuperscript{th}$}
Let me know when you get home.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just got home. Guessing you’re not too far behind. Hope you had a good day.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just walked through the door\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did you have a good night?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done. Quicker drive home then.\\
Yeah it was really fun. Later than I expected. We basically got chucked out of Heidrun.\\Had that annoying thing at the Indian where they let you sit for ages without bringing the bill.\\How are you? Did you have a good time?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh definitely quicker back even though loads of 50 zones.\\
Oh I'm so glad you had a good time! Which Indian did you go to?\\I'm alright. Had a brilliant day. I'm glad I went down but also the right choice to come back, I was in a lot of pain\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: We went to chutneys just on the way out of Wycombe.\\
Oh that good you had a good time.\\Was or are in a lot of pain? Certainly a better idea to come home if all you were going to do is wake up to drive home.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I quite like chutneys.\\
Bev wants to get together with us towards the end of June :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\I am quite hurty. Will take some extra drugs and will not set any alarms and hopefully sleep well.\\Yeah, I was only going to wake up and drive back. But omg those country lanes :face-with-tears-of-joy::woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That would be great.\\
You taking the new ones or ones you’ve had before. Good idea on the alarm. I’ll re tweak mine. Got shopping arriving 10-11.\\Hope your body and cat let you sleep but at least you have Monday as well.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ones I've had before. Need to have a look into the new ones first.\\
Yes, long weekend! Wonder if I notice that I was supposed to be on half term\\Are we still seeing each other tomorrow?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I don’t think you’ll notice.\\
You might notice how nice a 4 day week is though.\\I have it in my diary that we are seeing each other. Obviously see how you feel but after the F1 we can see each other.\\You had said frogfest but I was thinking I could just come over and maybe throw a cabinet together or two instead.\\We can work it out tomorrow\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki, we can work it out tomorrow.\\
Thank you so much for picking up my meds and dropping them off, and the pan, and feeding Spud, and generally just being a wonderful human being\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You’re very welcome. The drugs were super easy to pick up. Only one person in front. Got lucky on timing as load of people came in 2 minutes after me and the drugs were all ready and I didn’t have to answer a million questions.\\
Spud was good. Your Yale key is a bit funny to get in the lock. I couldn’t get his little cup thing out of the food so moved the whole thing. He jumped up on the side inspecting it all before I put it back down. I did add to his biscuits as well but he hadn’t eaten them all. I think it’s quite warm for him to maybe eat during the day.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know, the key is a bit funny sometimes.\\
Yeah he always inspects :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\Really appreciate you and it all.\\He does tend to eat a bit less in the summer so that's okay. But won't use his cooling pad of course\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Bedtime for this tired girly\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night, sleep well x x x x x x x x x x\\
I look forward to seeing you tomorrow\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I did think the flat was quite cool considering the outside but makes sense he eats a bit less when it warm.\\
Layla always ate less in summer.\\Night x x x x x x x x\\Looking forward to see you too\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00017888-GIF-2024-05-26-09-11-34.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
Are you feeling fragile this morning? It's definitely a big weekend for you.\\I think I slept okay. Can't remember waking up. But will still have a nap.\\It was really good to be home. I'm glad I managed a super lovely day and to sleep in my own bed\\What are you up to this morning?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Maybe a bit fragile but nothing bad. Just aware that I drank and had a late night.\\
A nap is always a good plan.\\This morning. I’ve got shopping arriving and will sort breakfast. I had visions of doing some revision before the F1. I should keep plugging through the exam. Then the race starts at 2pm and should be more exciting than last weeks one. Which says a lot for Monaco.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Really it just a level of baseline doubt I have that I could and should be doing better.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And the imperfections?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You can take a day off from revising, it will help reset your brain\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: My interpretation of the question was around how much I help my partner with the things they struggle with.\\
While I’d like to think I help I’m also aware that I can be dismissive of things or that I say the wrong thing.\\So, to me, I could improve.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I just read it as I accept your imperfections :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I probably over complicated it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What are you having for breakfast?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Going for my normal Sunday brunch today. Once food has been delivered. Then see what time I have after that before the f1\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Was the brunchy brunch good?\\
I went for a sleep, not even a nap :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I thought that what you had done. Brunch was good.\\
Do you feel better for the sleep?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, definitely. Now I'm going to potter :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Are you doing anything before F1?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I'm doing some busy work revision. I'm going through the books and pulling out all of the examples they have used as it is very clear that most if not all the exam questions will be based on examples.\\
This way I have them all in one place and can work through them without having to bounce around the books.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that is a brilliant plan!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I hope so. I think the exam is all about being able to find information quickly. So, i'm going to end up with all these piles of information.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But that's good. That's a fantastic way to prepare and revise. I always told my kids to do it this way\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What are your thoughts for later on after the F1?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I was just thinking about that\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Shall we do a cupboard or two?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: \url{https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGe4yHaWh/}\\
Omg you need this\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: yeah we can do that. If it isn't already its going to rain. I think we can get a the 2 book cases done fairly quick. You will have to prepare yourself for more mess before it gets better.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha okay. What time works for you?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: HA, somehow I suspect it would get dirty immediately and then never work again. Like a cheese toasty thingy\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: after 4pm. I can let you know once the race has finished and I need a quick shower\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki that works\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll bring tools as well.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Massive red flag on lap 1 :man-facepalming:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What does that mean?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Huge crash so they have stopped the race. They managed 4 corners and 7 cars all had various versions of an accident\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh so it's already finished?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Big debate now on what order it might restart in.\\
Not finished. They just need to fix the track and start again with one lap less\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Depending on how it restarts it could mean it’s going to be a snooze fest. If that happens I’ll let you know as I might be earlier.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. Just keep me updated. I  am definitely not presentable yet I. Any way shape or form :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :face-with-tears-of-joy: I’m sure that’s not completely true.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no it is\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll give you fair warning. I need to shower as well.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was the race?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Race is nearly over. I’ll try to be at yours for 5\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think there have been 5 overtakes :man-facepalming:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: On the way\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yay!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you so much for coming over :red-heart::red-heart:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Your welcome. It was nice doing an activity together even if I had forgotten how painful assembling Ikea is.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, you did do the heavy lifting. I appreciate it very much. Hopefully it won't be painful to get a replacement for the damaged one.\\
Are you having dinner?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hopefully it will just be annoying instead of painful. It’s always the visible bit that gets damaged. Never a back panel that you’d never even notice.\\
Just about to, throw some nuggets and chilli bites in the oven as I have less cheese than I thought\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I have loads! I could have sent you home with some.\\
I'm having a beige dinner too :grinning-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I thought I had more and extra chicken won’t kill me. You should have eaten while I was there\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah it's alright, I'll just be picking on stuff\\
Have you been managing to hit that massive protein goal?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Possibly not today but I did at least 4 days last week.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that's brilliant!!\\
I really need to look at my food now.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, why is he giving you the death stare? Did you make him sit there?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: He's giving me a loving stare!!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ve made it to bed. I’ll wish you good night x x x x x x\\
Hope you sleep ok and feel a bit better in the morning\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm just about to get in too.\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
How was spin? Hopefully Joseph wasn't covering it again.\\Not sure about plans yet. Might go for a walk, need to do a food shop and then will potter around sorting out the flat\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Spin was good. New calorie burn record of 888.\\
Now got to speed get ready for Hannah for 9.\\Sounds like a good plan.  Nice easy day as you enjoy your first proper bank holiday.\\No coffees with Katie?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh wow! Well done!\\
Hope Hannah doesn't destroy you completely.\\Yeah I'm going for coffee with Katie at 10:smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Coffee shopping nap pottering day done :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Perfect isn't it :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Are you studying after Hannah?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is the plan plus eating and getting dinner in the slow cooker\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sounds good! Let me know what time to come for\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sounds good! I'll see you then. Hope Hannah session is good\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00017959-GIF-2024-05-27-10-46-33.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh what kind of workouts did you do?\\
Glad it was good though and only mildly ruined.\\Hope your revision goes well\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: All upper body stuff and then core at the end. That was brutal.\\
Hope coffee was good. I’m hunting  (cooking)lunch then can get cracking\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah well done.\\
Coffee was good and food shop done. Sue texted so I'm just waiting for her and will do couple of laps of the rye with her. I don't think I'll get much done today :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Look at you. Proper little social butterfly.\\
Were you meant to get anything done? Other than pottering\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well stuff like sorting bits for the week, laundry etc.\\
But now I'm going to go home for a little nap :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: \url{https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGe4HhQYX/}\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: On my way\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Home! Bins done?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep done. Not enough paper to worry about in the end. Not going to waste a box on it being half full :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha. So pragmatic :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did you have a good time tonight?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: With you? Yes I did.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well yes :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: our evening together\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just checking. Felt like an odd question\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh, how so?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You know I like to ask :grinning-face-with-sweat:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Maybe not odd just out of place timing wise. But yes I really enjoyed spending the evening with you.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, you know I'm very good at weird timing :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm just about to get into bed, don't know where the time's gone\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You pottered :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Plus you’ve prob only been home an hour\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You are right!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: My brain does a little mini spiral on some of those questions. In my head I think the question has been asked so that you can then provide a different answer once I answer. If that makes any sense at all.\\
Like I’ll say I had a good time (which I did) but my brain is waiting for a list of reasons why you didn’t or a list of things I did wrong.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s a curse more than anything.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh bub, you know it's never like that with me. I will never ask questions to "catch you out" or something. I know it's not easy to automatically switch that off so I will keep reminding you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know you’re not trying to catch me out but you also wanted to know more things.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes! Definitely. And I appreciate you telling me this :smiling-face: keep it coming!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to head to sleep now.\\
Night night. Sweet dreams x x x x x x x x x x x\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night x x x x x x x x x\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: I can just jump straight to breakfast and get cracking with work.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
Almost there :face-with-tears-of-joy: just getting dressed and having breakfast. Also very good gif today! I always look forward to seeing what you send each morning.\\I thought that might have been the case. Glad you're taking it easy. I was thinking and if you'd like I can come with you on Sunday to cheer and support :smiling-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What are you going over today?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sunday could be good. I thought you didn’t want to? Need to see about a ticket and I’m 99\% sure you’d have to drive yourself as my bike takes up the whole car :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: but you wouldn’t have to be as early as I will be.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ve e still got one question left on this doomed exam paper. Then I want to go over the book example and make sure I can get the same answers as they do. All while trying to update the PowerPoint I created for quick reference notes.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I thought you didn't necessarily want\/need me to come :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: but I'll always go to support you whenever you want\\
I might need to get tickets before Friday if still available. What time are you getting there?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's a good plan! Is there anything at all I can help with?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s part of the awkward thing for me about having someone support me. I think it would be nice to see you there but equally it might be boring for you. I might be wrong but my brain remembers you initially asking about it in a way that made it seem you didn’t want to go. Something like “you don’t need me to spectate?”\\
I think we need to be there for 7 and our start wave is 8:15 but I need to check.\\There is a discount code for spectators BPTRI20 I need to have a better look not on my phone.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I don’t think so, thanks.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I'm sorry if it came across like that, definitely didn't mean it in that way. I just thought that because you're going with your brother and friends you wouldn't necessarily want me to tag along. Obviously I need to be better here at communicating\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Seems like we both made some assumptions.\\
If you want to come that would be great. Mark bought the kids to my first one to spectate and they enjoyed it. It certainly is a good one to be a spectator on as it’s pretty easy to move around and see people.\\None of my friends are going. It’s just a few of my brothers friends.\\There might be a couple of YPOM people there as Doug is a weekend warrior at the event. Trying to go round as many times as he can. I’m hoping he only overtakes me once.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. I'll come :smiling-face:\\
Hope the revision goes well\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: my brain just short circuited on a question so I distracted myself and looked up some stuff from yesterday on when we have had sex this year. As you seemed to shut down a bit after it came up.\\
This month you are right in that it has been about once a week.\\May - 6, 11, 18, 27\\April - 10, 27\\March - 20\\Feb - 11, 14\\Jan - 3, 23\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't really know what to say to this to be honest.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I'm not sure there is anything to say.\\
Yesterday you were pretty adamant that we were averaging once a week, which is correct for this month but it felt defensive when I disagreed with you. We may have been thinking on different time scales that's all.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: in other news. I am absolutely doomed for this exam. Its taken me 2 hours to do 2 parts of one question and i'm pretty sure I;ve done one of the parts wrong.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I just didn't realise that meticulous record was being kept of our activities. And the whole "definitely not more than 5 times" did feel a little like a dig so I guess I did get a little defensive.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Remember you are also taking notes and arranging the bits you'll need. First go at an exam question always takes the longest and is the hardest. What's your plan now?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: meticulous is a real stretch. It is just part of what I write in my diary about what has gone on that day. I'm not recording start finish times or anything like that :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
I wanted to check as I did feel a bit bad about the 5 times thing, especially as I was wrong and its 9. This all assumes I've not missed one. Plus I've had to keep track in order for the upcoming test to be valid. None of it was meant as a dig and I know that I'm bad at remember how long things have been and how often I do or dont do stuff.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: finish this current part of a question. Have a break down over lunch and continue\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How did the question go?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Got 2 parts left.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: <attached: 00018012-GIF-2024-05-28-14-34-43.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've got such a banging headache again from this weather :face-with-rolling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I bet. It certainly isn't helping. Could be because your super focused as well\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly I don't know if I've been focused much today :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just dealing with IKEA. Sounds like they will be able to resend the frame\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: oh, that seems unexpectedly simple\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup. Sending a new frame on Saturday and £5 voucher\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00018019-GIF-2024-05-28-18-47-01.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You alright?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The brain is mush\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: first tutorial of the evening done\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh is it the double tutorial night tonight?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: yeah, technically a triple but i'll have to watch that one next week as its for next weeks exam\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well triple\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Jinx :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have you had dinner?\\
I just got back from the gym. God it was heaving. Absolute paradise having upstairs\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: have you found something to do this evening?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: ahh, they gym\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: I thought you had steph Thursday?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: good arse shot :winking-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's the only thing you see?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's last week that she had to reschedule\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: well no I see other stuff as well. Great lat definition\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm quite chuffed\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i got confused i though it got rescheduled for Thursday.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: where's that shot from xmas to comparre\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: the shoulder blade muscle looks bigger as well\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: oh i found it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: She's going to do proper measuring and photos next session\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm definitely wonky on the left side, you can really see it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: One side is always stronger. Is that the bad hip side?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes it is\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What time is next tutorial?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: 15 minutes.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think this next one is interactive :loudly-crying-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh nooo. But brain mush\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Was the first one good at least?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Maybe, it’s all just a lot of information. Feel like I need a crime board or something thing and have hundred of pages stuck to the walls so I can just run around to find the information\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: <attached: 00018052-GIF-2024-05-28-19-22-46.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Wish I could be information finder for you on Friday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: that gif is exactly right\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: its not so bad if i know what i'm looking for. Its when I only have a vauge idea that its bad\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You'll get through. It's just so much at the same time. But you've been working hard\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That's done. Was helpful. Need to review one of the question we had tomorrow. Going to have a quick shower then sit and watch something.\\
Have you been up to anything?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's good! You'll get through, slow and steady.\\
I made a banging omelette for dinner :drooling-face:, made lunch and then just sat for a bit. Going to have a shower and then potter my way to bed :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\What are you watching?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: The clickspring you tube channel just released a new video on some tooling for the Antikythera he is building using ancient techniques. So I’ll see what that is like.\\
Can an omelette be banging?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The what of what?\\
Omg yes, potatoes, ham, peas yum yum\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That was good up until peas\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: \url{https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antikythera-mechanism}\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: \url{https://youtube.com/@clickspring?si=Vdl8nCG-w5voyEgh}\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ooh that sounds interesting!!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You like peas!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Like is a strong word with my feeling about peas.\\
That you tube channel is really good. All very well shot. He built a clock completely from scratch. It’s amazing.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, ok, you dislike them less :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Oh that's great! Hope the video is good :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope the brain switch off worked.\\

Oh is it instead of Friday?\\Hope the session is good :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\I'm okay. Can feel I've been to the gym but can walk :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah instead of Friday because of the exam and Sunday.\\
I think we might be doing squats but not sure.\\Walking is good :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh of course. My brain is proper mush this week :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
Squats are always good :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\Is it at 7?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah 7. Gets it done then hopefully I can get the next 2 nights of reasonable sleep as I don’t have to get up early.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes! Hopefully and all rested and ready for Friday.\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah well done! Glad you're building back up.\\
Hope revision goes well x\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you surviving?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: just about. A little bit of going around and around. Got some clarifications done. Just trying to work through stuff I haven't yet done and add to, what is now, a monster of a PPT notes thingy.\\
How's the corporate world doing?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Corporate world keeps turning :beaming-face-with-smiling-eyes: it was a good productive day. I still have the stupid headache.\\
Maybe you can use couple of hours tomorrow to just go through our mammoth ppt to make sure you know where everything is.\\What's your plan for this evening?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: glad you've had a productive day. That headache is annoying. The weather really hasn't changed much. I've no idea if my headache is weather or work.\\
I've got the last exam tutorial at 7pm and then if im not a complete dribbling mess on the floor I might play some games with Matt to reset.\\That is part of the plan tomorrow. Finish off reading these example and rearrange my PPT for quick reference. maybe a bit of a once over on the office to spread all my papers around. I did an experiment with writing an answer and then getting a copy of it into a word document. I think I am just as fast typing it.\\Someone on the call yesterday said "Computers aren't really my thing" How the fuck they are doing a degree in astronomy I have no idea. Some of the work the tutors must have to mark must really be something.\\What are your plans now you have at least 4-5 hours available?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I bet yours is from work. You've been super concentrating for days now.\\
That's a good plan! You are doing everything to give yourself the best chance\\Omg were they like 60? Even those people don't say it anymore\\I'm going for dinner with the school friend I mentioned :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Some of them are old. There are a couple of scary forum posts that clearly demonstrate that people cannot read the simple instructions on what they need to do for the exam. Somehow it seems that these people understand the material better. How they get to year 3 of a pretty computer intensive course and not know baffles me. Unless they only ever use the book and write everything on paper.\\
Oh, I have a vague memory of that (sorry). Hope you have fun\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I mean I used to write a lot of stuff on paper but wouldn't if it was programming based degree :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
But people as a group cannot read for comprehension for shit.\\Oh don't apologise, you have other things to store in your head right now :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: we're going to the Turkish restaurant.\\Oh mum texted that the probate might be finished soon :upside-down-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I'm all for writing on paper. It generally faster and help the brain remember better for reasons but the lack of what I believe is very basic IT skills on an IT heavy course is really insane. Every one of our assignments had python in it and some people cannot work out how to produce a single PDF as an answer sheet. Madness.\\
Oh nice. It was so good when we went.\\Hasn't that been true for a while or has some next step been reached? Do you know if or what you might be getting?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh god. That is madness. How are they still on the course?!?\\
It was! We should get together with Michelle and Matt soon again.\\Oh no. It's been absolutely dragging, with court and lawyers and evil step mother and all that.\\I don't know really, will probably have a call tomorrow. I'm hoping it will be enough to pay for the car and invest a little bit (I don't know where yet)\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: They have hung on somehow. I think I lot are a little like me and doing it for interest. At least I hope so as there paper based approach immediately fails if they actually tried to get a job, all of which would need programming.\\
Yes we should. Might be a little while as Matt is going away for a lad holiday soon. He was trying to explain to me earlier how super busy he is over the next month :man-facepalming:. That mans busy is most peoples day of doing fuck all.\\Well the investment bit is the easy bit. I check with Lester what the current ETF's are to use and just go with that.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you having the chicken for dinner?\\
Oh Matt :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone: any news in his job journey?\\Oh thank you, that would be really helpful. I know nothing about that topic\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: yep, chicken again and earlier I realised that i'm also going to have to cook and eat next week as well. Shows how well my brain is going. So will be repeating this week for simplicity.\\
Not really any news. He indicated that this mystery job from his friend Neal has a July start date. I think it all made up at the moment. No interview, no terms, no money discussion.\\First step is just a stocks and shares ISA. then its pick the investment. Easy to sort out, just a small faff which is why most dont bother.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I can make you some food for next week if it makes things easier :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
Oh god that doesn't sound super good\\Once I know if anything is coming and all the exams are done we can have a look\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thanks but that slower cooker recipe is so easy. 10 mins to throw it all in and then just cook all day. I'll do a load of rice and then i'm set for the week. Same for my lunch. Only 15 mins to cook it all.\\
Doesn't sound the most solid but that's Matt issue to solve before he gets murdered by his wife :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\In other things while on my mind. Saturday, ive agreed to be at my parents for 1:30 for dog sitting. Sunday my wave start time is 8:50. I need to be there for 7:20 but you can be later than that. Hopefully I should be finished by 11.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just got home. It was so lovely.\\
I now need to see when the IKEA order is getting here on Saturday and one of my department friends (the one who came around Christmas when I wasn't well) wanted to do lunch so I have no idea what's happening.\\Am I definitely not fitting in with you on Sunday?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You can always meet me at my parents if you like to see the puppy. I’ll be there a while.\\
We will have to test on Friday. I’m pretty sure the bike means the seat either has to go flat or all the way forward for it to fit\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your evening been? Was the tutorial helpful?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Tutorial was good but about half way through I was done. Just playing some games.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good. Hope the brain resets :purple-heart:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How are the games going? I've just got into bed.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Matt is soooo shit.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: So good then? :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s ok. I’m not doing that bad but Matt cannot win a gun fight one on one for money. He doesn’t think or he thinks and when he thinks it takes too long and he gets shot\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah. Sounds very Matt\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to turn in. Night night. Hope you get some good sleep and enjoy the lie in x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night x  x x x x x x x\\

Hope you sleep well.\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00018106-GIF-2024-05-30-09-05-20.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x\\
Yes, in the office today.\\Oh I'm glad you had a proper lie in. Did you sleep well?\\What's on the list for the last day before exam?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Slept ok and nice to snooze the alarm.\\
Plan for today is going through examples, reviewing some of the stuff from yesterday’s tutorial, looking at my old assignments and having them available for the exam. Test the standing desk\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good plan! Make sure you are taking regular breaks.\\
Btw, there are load of street food vans at the walled garden on Friday night so I thought it would be nice to pop down\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That sounds like a good idea for tomorrow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sending big brain and revision vibes\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Alive?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: and not crying\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You at home? How was the day?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's a positive :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your day been?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just leaving the office\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i think the day has been ok. Just reading and writing stuff down. rinse and repeat. There are a few examples that i have absolutely no idea about if they appear on the exam tomorrow but nothing i can do about that.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sounds like a productive day. Are you doing anything this afternoon\/evening?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not really. I'll need dinner at some point and a shower. Might change my bed. Plus more revision. Just want to make sure I have at least read all of the examples. There are a lot more than i thought\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: what are you up to?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Is there anything I can do to make it easier\/help you for tomorrow?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not much. Need a quiet evening I am quite fatigued. Dinner, and maybe a bit of crochet\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No I dont think so. I just need to keep going and then just do the exam. Thank you though.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I want to take care of you and I don't know how :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know. I;m not sure how either and i;m not sure there is anything you can do. I already have dinner sorted and its only me that can do the revision and prepare my office. Would be more things that could be done if I had pets or something\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well I'm giving you all the mental strength and brain waves then :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You alright? How's your evening?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: still not crying :face-with-tears-of-joy:. I dallied a bit with dinner. Have finished going through all the examples. My brain is fried. Short of reading everything again (which is impossible) I dont think there is much more I can do before tomorrow. I'll read the chapter summaries and go over my PPT of notes again before I get started. I've got a check list of things to do before I click the start button as well. Will set the alarm for 7:30 and go from there. No real pressure on when to start. Just want it done now.\\
Did you get up to much?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well done! That's good :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
You've been working so hard. You'll do your best tomorrow.\\That's a good plan for tomorrow. And once you're done we can celebrate a little :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\No not really. Had some dinner and then just crocheted and watched some TV.\\What are you doing to reset the noggin tonight?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also, I wrote all this and didn't send it :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, I thought it was odd that you hadn’t replied.\\
Sounds like a pretty good evening for you. Rested and did something. You wouldn’t have done that a couple of months ago ago.\\Just going to now watch a couple of you tube vids down stairs and then go to bed.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Mushy brain, sorry.\\
No I wouldn't. Emma yesterday said that I looked so much happier\\Did you finish that fancy pants building video you told me about?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh yeah I finished that. Almost tempted to re watch his clock build series but working through another makers library again.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: With Emma’s comment it amazing what happens when you have a bit of space\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh my lovely lovely nerd :nerd-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It obviously is. I was hoping it would be an improvement but didn't really expect much\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Always better to have a low expectations exceeded rather than the other way around. I had much higher expectation\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did you?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Only compared to you not in terms of how it has worked out. It’s worked out pretty much like I thought.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How did you think it would work out?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Mainly because I didn’t expect much change from CPS to EY but the change surprised me\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I was pretty confident you’d feel better, worry about work less and be surprised by how much time you’d suddenly have\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You're quite spot on :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Every now and then I’m right :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Even though, it hasn't even be a month and there are some biiiiig projects happening\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s good.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am realising that I definitely need to work on my corporate language :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I watched one of my team today talk out of a really difficult situation and end the whole thing on a positive and I was just mind blown\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I do think there is a skill to it. Some people are very good in a positive way and some are very good in an extremely frustrating way\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: She's very good\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I mean she's like a certified coach and all\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Might ask her for some tips\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Do, ping her on teams :face-vomiting: and set up a coffee or lunch\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I'll ping her for a connect\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :face-vomiting::face-vomiting:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll make sure to drive that meeting\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: See I'm learning :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How is there new corporate BS. No had drive the meeting before\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I've heard that like 5 times today\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Urgh\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Lord I'm having a lot of late nights\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, what did you get distracted doing\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just doom scrolling tbh\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And stroking the cat\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I thought you were going to say pottering\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The doom scrolling is too easy\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: for once, no\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I need to cut down on that\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s just to easy to do when you got time to do nothing\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It is\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well now I'm pottering to the bed :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night x x x x x x x x x x x\\
Hope you get some good rest\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night x x x c x x x x\\

I was up early but then went back to bed :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\How are you feeling? Had breakfast and all? When are you starting?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I thought you must have gone back to sleep. Was odd that you’d done paired but not WhatsApp.\\
Feeling ok at the moment. Just had food. Will start setting up in the next half hour or so\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Today is the last day to get 10\% off spectator tickets for Sunday\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Done :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah still feeling fatigued so thought it might be a good idea do get an extra hour or two\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good idea and doable now with wfh\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll be thinking of you! You can do this! Sending you clear head and concentration vibes. You've done all the work, now just to get it into the exam. You're amazing and clever. Love you :red-heart:\\
Let me know when you finish\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Will do. Everything will be going DnD before I start but will\\
Msg after\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good!\\
Good luck\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00018194-GIF-2024-05-31-15-00-46.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Every well done! You got through. Tell me a little about it?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: fucking horrible. Spent to long on the first set of question but baring some silly mistakes I must of made I dont think they were awful. Then the main 3 question all various levels of a disaster. Defiantly have part of a multi question wrong as they give you the answer and you have to show how to get there. I couldn't get the math to work. 1 question had exactly the thing I didn't want. Which is to prove an equation is true. I have zero idea how to do it. One question had ratio's of a made up universe and we had to use the real ones to work something out. That was left blank.\\
Probably left 15 marks completely unanswered as I had no clue at all. A good 10 marks is a total fudge. SO that's 25\% gone before I get anything wrong\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It sounds like a really hard exam. Well done for getting through it, you've done all you could. Hopefully it's not as bad as you're thinking.\\
What's the pass mark?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: pass mark is 40\% but will be very disappointed if i'm just scrapping stuff\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: going to get some food and then maybe a bath\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What time are we doing stuff later?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know. You've done so much work for this! Hopefully taking your calculations in you'll be in the mid\/high 60s\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good plan\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Shall we say 5.30 ISH?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: you coming here or me coming to you?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I can pick you up once I fill the tire\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Tyre\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: when was this taken? Matt just had a puncture fixed this week. Adams and Page is where I would start\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's this morning. My neighbour sent it. It's the same one I had to fill at Katie's.\\
Yeah, I always go there for tyres\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to fill the tyre and then will be on my way to you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok I’m just getting in the shower\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Home!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done.\\
Pottering?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just a little on the way to bed\\
You?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just watching a bit of you tube\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Of course. Clock building?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not yet :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Warzone vid\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
That would have been my second guess\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well I pottered longer than expected :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: In bed now. Night night x x x x x x x x x x x x sleep well\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x\\
I've been coffeeing for a while now :smiling-face:\\How did you sleep?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I thought ok but seems like I was up a lot before my alarm went off.\\
Time for my own coffee and then start sorting out stuff for tomorrow.\\Do you need me to add anything to my shopping for tomorrow\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Slight change of plans for me. Mum isn’t feeling to week so she isn’t going out now. Going over this morning to say hello and then will be home this afternoon\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Could you pop in couple of cordials for me please :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Is mum okay? Say hello from me please. I'll text you when I'm on my way from Ruislip but it probably won't be before 4 x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just a cold and chest infection\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that's not great. Hope she feels better soon x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Brilliant thank you.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just waiting for the train. Didn't even have time to go back home :upside-down-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: To busy chatting :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha yeah\\
Are you still at mum's?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: For now. Will head back for lunch.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Enjoy :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your day been?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s been ok. Bike fits on the car and seems ready. Just sorting a few bits for tomorrow.\\
How’s was yours? Are you on your way back?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh well done. Sounds productive. Do I fit too? :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Do you need anything for tomorrow?\\It's been lovely. Really nice seeing Maria. Just waiting for the train back and am absolutely pooped. Definitely overdid it today :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah you fit as well :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:. You’re ok on the roof?\\
No don’t need anything. Thanks.\\Ha, I thought you might have. Are you dropping by or just leave till tomorrow?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, might get a bit windswept :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Could we leave it till tomorrow. This way I'll be able to cheer extra hard :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What are you up to after finishing getting things ready.\\
Btw, I got a doggy bag from lunch because I absolutely could not finish it. Would you like it for after race tomorrow? It's chicken\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not really sure. In a bit of a limbo state really. I might make some pizza bases so I can have pizza or might just oven some stuff. Not decided yet.\\
I’ll find something to do.\\Chicken is always good. Will you not have it tomorrow for dinner?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sorry. Did me not stopping by ruin plans?\\
No, I'm good. Had enough Turkish food this week to last me :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Didn’t ruin anything. I thought you might skip it as you didn’t get to go home this morning. Minds just a bit all over the place today.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What's been on your mind?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Exams\\
Sorting out stuff for tomorrow and the logistics of it.\\Weirdly what lunch is tomorrow :man-facepalming:although there should be a food van or two.\\My Nan to some extent, mainly due to it adding a lot to my parents and I think I’m going to get more of it after my exam this week. We’ve got to start selling her house now.\\I spiralled a bit on yesterday and I’m sorry if (that) I made you feel rejected. That wasn’t my plan. Yesterday was a pretty poor self esteem day for me and I’ve never liked people seeing me in a towel plus being in that weird “sticky” phase from the shower. Which is just being damp but everything sticks. I have a bit of fear (probably irrational) that if you see me at some odd angle you’ll just be done. That may be due to too many videos online of people that’s it happened to.\\Plus I then made you feel bad so that really didn’t help with the low self esteem bit along with the broken brain. What annoys me about myself for the whole thing is that it all probably would have gone differently if I’d have been 10 minutes quicker.\\You know, normal things.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: God I was so worried seeing *typing......* for so long :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sorry I move to sit down\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't worry about lunch. If you want I can bring sandwiches. I've got ham and cheese.\\
Exams are super stressful. I think you just need to ride out this week.\\Have you spoken to mum about nan? How's dad doing? Is she going to go to a home from hospital?\\I did think you might have been thinking about that.\\A) I'm not "people"\\B) very irrational fear - I fancy you!\\C) internet lies, I've proved that to you before\\D) please stop being mean to my boyfriend\\I'm not going to lie, it didn't feel the greatest, and I did wonder I would you have reacted if the roles were reversed. But we get through stuff like this because we talk about it :smiling-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Is there an autocorrect failure in that last sentence?\\
Spoke to Mum and Dad about it a bit. Nan wont be going home. Although she has told my dad that she could go home with full time care. Which just isn't true because she has proved she wont take care of herself and ignoring that bit its just too expensive compared to a home. So if she leaves hospital, which in some ways it would be better if she didn't. She will go to a home somewhere.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What do you mean about the last sentence?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: "and I did wonder I would you have reacted if the roles were reversed."\\
doesn't make sense\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How would you have :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: oh, that makes more sense. If you want the answer to the question. I probably wouldn't have tried to initiate because I would have expected a no. I would have pre spiralled a whole scenario because we were going out and it would have led to one or both of us being annoyed because I tried and then got rejected\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And any other thoughts on any of the other stuff I wrote?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I thought I answered the questions and for the points you are right. Was just a day I very much got stuck in my head\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well I'm glad you told me about it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Michelle says good luck for tomorrow\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s nice of her. How did she get on?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It was harder.  Loved the bike bit on the new bike tho.\\
Weather was perfect.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 2hrs 16\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The bike bit is nice. Proper country park views. I might have to rethink my time as I don’t see how I could be faster than Michelle.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: She has poorly tummy from yesterday\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you up to much tonight?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: From the food van? That would make it all very hard.\\
Not really. Just finished dinner. Now watching bullet train. Will try for an early night.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: What are you doing?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just pottering and tidying little bits, not feeling great as predicted\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What's the plan for tomorrow?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Plan for tomorrow is I pick you up at 6:20 or I at least leave my house at 6:20. Drive to Blenheim. I do my thing, at least get a drink after. Then drive back. I’ve got shopping arriving 2:30-3:30\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ve set my alarm for 5:10 :loudly-crying-face::loudly-crying-face::loudly-crying-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Brill. I did mean just the morning, was quite sure about the rest :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: This has been sitting on my mind\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Which bit? That I wouldn’t have initiated <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That you wouldn't initiate\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: In the context of yesterday in my mind I’d already worked out that I didn’t think you’d be interested because it was the end of the week and Thursday you said you were quite fatigued along with again on Friday. Plus we were going out which adds a time pressure (that’s what I told myself) and specifically for yesterday being a bit of a down day for me I didn’t want you to have a disappointing experience. Which I actually made worse in the end with you feeling rejected.\\
In other thinking about it I might be narrowing done some of my issue. I’m really not used to initiating during the day. My mind just assumes it’s the very last thing you’d want to do. I’m used to initiating either in the morning or evening. Mainly because if we are already in bed my mind feels there is less chance of being told no. So I know I have to change that thought process.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You seem to decide in your mind that I'm not interested even before I get to yours. I completely get that you had an off day yesterday, and you have so much stuff going on at the moment and I absolutely do not expect you to be always in the mood, that is absolutely not the point. It's just been playing on my mind how you've said last week that we don't have sex enough ( or only a handful of times), but the initiating still fully falls on me (and I get that a part of that is your consideration for my health, which I appreciate). Just the combination made me feel a bit meh. Not necessarily rejected, just more like not wanted. And I know that is my issue to work on. I just need to be told and shown I'm important to you and wanted I guess\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Bub?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I didn’t realise I’d made you think you’re not important to me. I know I can always do better but I thought I was showing that you are very important to me. Me doing things for you is my way of showing how important you are to me.\\
I know I’m not good at saying nice things but I thought I was getting better and if you can believe me I am trying. I even thought I did quite well on that front yesterday.\\I know I’ve been distracted or more focused the last week or so. So I probably haven’t been as attentive but I certainly didn’t think that you thought you weren’t important.\\Going to the start of your message. I definitely do that and it’s got to be linked to my past. I want you to tell me things and tell me how you’re doing. If you tell me your having a bad day (for whatever reason, doesn’t have to be health) by brain just flips a switch “don’t make her day worse by trying to have sex.” Or something to that effect.\\Based on the realisation I had that I’m only used to initiating in the morning or evening I have had it in my mind to really try when we’ve been together. I’m still not quite sure how I’ll do that but the last 2 times you’ve sort of jumped me straight through the door. So I never got a chance.\\I’m not sure what I need to do to convince you of how much I want you and how wanted you are.\\I do find things during the day or think of things I could send you but then talk myself out of sending it.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: God I got worried there again :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have to try and make sure autocorrect doesn’t mess me up and want to try and get it right\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Believe it or not I am trying to not mess up\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: First things first. I don't want you to stress over this. As I said above, I know you have loads of things going on at the moment and I completely understand\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: But if you don’t think you’re important to me that is a problem.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You know I also sometimes get into my own head and I thought it would be good and in the spirit of cards on the table to tell you what was going on in my head. I'm not blaming you for anything - I know we are trying. I want us to work so much so I don't want to hide feelings from you good or not so good\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I do get what you mean but you're never going to make my day worse by wanting me\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh sorry I don't mean to jump you :face-with-tears-of-joy: well I mean I do but you know. I love you and I want you. I know you might not be used to that but I do fancy the pants off you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Please don't talk yourself out of sending me things that make you think of me. That is sweet\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Of course I believe you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I do know it. I'm just having a bit of a vulnerable blip I think\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s the bit I need to get my brain to fix. In my head I can just see some version of a reply along some various of “why would you send me this when you know we can’t today \/ this week”\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You get vulnerable when you feel ill. I think we all do. I love you, want you and want this all to work so badly.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I like it, you just beat me to it that all. I am not used to it at all.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok, you haven’t seen some of it yet. Some of it might not be that sweet :face-with-tears-of-joy: <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Me too. I really really do\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh well so just 3:1 ratio of sweet to sexy please. I am after all a hopeless romantic :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to try an early night and hopefully won't sleep through my alarms tomorrow.\\
Night night x x x x x x x x x , sleep well big day tomorrow.\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m just about to head to bed as well\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x x\\
:face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy: It will be great!\\Hope you slept well\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I definitely could have slept better. Was up at 4am for a bit.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no. Race day nerves\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I guess, just don’t need.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Let me know when you're on your way\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just putting my shoes on now\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I am no longer spicy and am back in comfy clothes. Hope you have a good nap.\\
It was really nice you coming to watch me.:red-heart:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well I set an alarm and didn't even hear it :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
It was lovely being there for you. What are you up to?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I thought you’d been asleep for a while. I have a different alarm you can try if you like. It’s obnoxious with its tone.\\
I was watching tv and just zoning out. Shopping arrived. Legs and feet hurt. Now playing games.\\What are you going to do now? Bath time?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Completely conked out.\\
I think I must have heard it and switched it off :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\Oh I hope the legs don't hurt too much? Are you doing spin tomorrow?\\I need to call mum but yes, bath after :smiling-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just muscle pain but I somehow have 3 blisters. 2 of which are in between the toes :man-facepalming:. Baby powder is needed I think for drying feet.\\
Skipping spin because it’s Joseph but got Hannah at 8am.\\Everything ok or just a check in call?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no blisters! The toe ones are horrendous. Definitely talcum powder needed there\\
Oof, hopefully it won't be too bad. But a big couple of days for you again. It will be good to have some time off events and rest properly in between.\\Yeah just a check in and to find out about the probate and stuff\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It will be nice to just focus on some consistency for a month or two.\\
That should be interesting. Good luck\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It will! And we'll be better at eating too :smiling-face:\\
It's still not finished. Another hearing on the 11th :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone::woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone::woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Phones just vibrated itself to death :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: More to come\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Please share the others' photos with them\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Bathed?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :upside-down-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you pottered\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How are games going?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just was on the phone and then made dinner\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Meh at best\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Always such a positive review\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just can’t get a flow to connect for a whole game\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Matt is tired. Seb is shit and I did a triathlon :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What's Matt tired from? :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: who knows. Probably from sleeping too much. He might have walked the dog and\/or walked downstairs at some point\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Gotten any better?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The games? Not really. Having dinner now,\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It would be nice to play with people of the same or better level than me.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha I bet! I think I'd be shit too :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What are you having? Cheese?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Chicken nuggets and chilli bites. Only a little bit of cheese\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Almost went to McDonalds but thought better of it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah well done! I had an omelette\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Has that become your Sunday go to?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think so :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's just so easy and filling and protein\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Very true.\\
Have you made it to the bath or did other things get in the way\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Other things :pensive-face: but just about to shower\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have you had a bath?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Nah, i would have if the shopping wasn’t arriving so just showered instead.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You should take one tomorrow. Your body is battered\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I might have one tomorrow as a break from work. I’m hoping I’ll be ok tomorrow minus the blisters\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Can you get a bath in tomorrow before or after book club\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good plan.\\
Bookclub is on Tuesday so I want to sort the flat out tomorrow and then have a bath\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Damn I thought I’d remembered that well.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha don't worry. You've got other bits to concentrate on at the moment\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have you spoken to your mum?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Is book club always on a Tuesday?\\
I was going to phone after dinner but then it got too late. I’ll phone her tomorrow\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The Jenny one is, but the Agi one is usually on Monday :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I hope she's not feeling too rough\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh ok, my brain isn’t completely failing then.\\
I hoping she started to feel a little better once the children and puppy got picked up.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No it isn't! If you asked two weeks later you would have been right. Reminds me I've got to finish the bloody book and start the other one. Not into this one much\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What book is it? Does the group need recommendations as I have some sci fi ones I can throw in and most are series\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's Dark Matter, I mentioned it before.\\
No we're good. We've got a list all the way to February I think\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh yeah that was it. The alternative universe one\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I'm just not finding it super interesting\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The trailer for the tv show looked out but I’ve not found myself wanting to watch it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: To be honest I think you'd like the book\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: As you know I live the rock and roll life style. In other news because I pulled an all dayier. I am now in bed :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha well done. I'm just doing a closing shift and will be going too.\\
You must be shattered after today\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: “Closing shift” :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Quite shattered yeah. I certainly wouldn’t want to do another one in the morning.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well you'll just have to lift like 170kg :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Right, I made it to bed too\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The lifting is easier. Will just be arms tomorrow. So that easier.\\
Well done. I best wish you good night then. X x x x x x x x x\\Thank you again for coming with me today. It really did mean a lot to have you support me.\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
\section*{Monday $03\textsuperscript{rd}$}
I'm glad you liked having me there. I'll always go support you.\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00018470-GIF-2024-06-03-07-10-59.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x\\
Oh no :face-with-tears-of-joy: wonder what kind of nature it was.\\I'm glad you're not suffering too much. Hopefully Hannah won't kill you off this morning.\\I'm just about to have breakfast\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll have a look when I go outside to see if I can see strike marks or something else made a noise. Which is much more concerning. Don’t know why a bird would fly into a window with curtains shut anyway\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah it's weird. Maybe it was a drunk bird coming home from a weekend bender :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was your session with Hannah?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00018475-GIF-2024-06-03-09-51-29.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well done!\\
What's the plan for the rest of the day?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Shower and breakfast. I’ve got some house jobs that need doing. Mainly putting some clothes away, quick kitchen clean and start off the slow cooker for dinner. Then just do some revision. Will probably start with the tutorial I missed last week and do a couple of quizzes that we have available. See what’s gets done.\\
You still planning a chill evening?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sounds like a good, productive day. Are you making the chicken again?\\
Yup, massively need a chill evening, but also to do a food shop :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah just doing that chicken again. Couldn’t really be bothered to think about it too hard, I have the stuff and it’s super fast to throw together.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How’s the sun burn?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's tasty :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not bad at all.\\
But I am feeling really rough today, pain and face is numb again. Will try to find out if I can work from home this afternoon\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m sorry. That’s got to be frustrating.\\
I guess there no reason for it today?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The whole weekend\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm home\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done. Whats the plan. Lunch, nap work, bath, potter?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nap, then have a few meetings and then rest. How's your day going?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sounds like a good plan. Put your phone on the other side of the room so you dont turn it off by mistake?\\
Are you going to try out your new drugs or are they for something different?\\Do you need anything?\\Somehow its 12:30 and it feels like it would be 11 at best. Dinner is cooking at least and been setting up to do something work based. Currently not in the mind set for it.\\Looks like I've finally got a weekend set to see Kate and Rich. First weekend in August :man-facepalming:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes that's a good idea. Will try the new drugs after work because they might send me to sleep.\\
I'm okay, thank you. Just climbed into bed.\\Can you do something to reset the brain and start work at 1.30?\\Oh that's good! At least it's in the diary now :smiling-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know my brain is just a bit blocked because its close to lunch even though when I have lunch doesn't matter and I have nothing else happening today. Will do a bit more "busy work" of sorting stuff out ready to use and then its probably a good idea to just get a few others jobs done, have lunch and get back to it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: hope you feel a bit better after you nap\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's a good idea\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I logged on for a meeting and got told to log off and go back to bed :pensive-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s sort of good. Nice for them to give you time.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes. I was just hoping I wouldn't need time off this early. How's work going?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know, but you cannot control these things. Are you still working or are you done for the day?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Work is a bit slow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No I didn't work in the end, was just in bed. I took the new meds but apart from feeling a bit weird I don't know if they're doing anything\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You just need to get your brain in the game again. Last week was super exhausting mentally and physically for you. Whatever you do today is good.\\
Doing anything tonight?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: what does "A bit weird" mean. Given your reaction to some drugs that might be them working. I'm guessing they haven't taken any pain away?\\
Not doing anything tonight beyond dinner and seeing what work I can get done. Haven't planned any games or anything.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just a bit off, can't really explain it - brain foggy, nausea, slow. But I think they did take away some pain, at least I am more tingly than hurty.\\
Make sure you plan in a brain reset :smiling-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: that sounds like a very so slight positive increase from the drugs then. Its must be a real pain (no pun intended) that they just seem to spread and convert the pain around. Rather than just remove some of it.\\
I don't know why but I wondered the other day if beta blockers would do anything. I'm guessing not but as they seem to disconnect parts of the brain from the body I wondered if they would do anything.\\I'll find a way to reset. Dinner always takes an hour anyway :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's just frustrating. And I know it's my fault. I've been feeling so well recently that I just kept wanting to do stuff and then I did too much stuff. It almost felt like I had my body at least partially but of course not and I crashed. Need to be better at pacing now I actually have brain power\\
I did try beta blockers before but they had a very time limited impact. Worked for about 3 months and then my body just got used to them and I was back in square one\\Haha. Will you be having the chicken you are making?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well don't be hard on yourself about it. If anything at least you found a new limit or a frustrating reminder to pay attention when your body is saying its getting close to the limit. Maybe I should've have suggested yesterday. I'm guessing the missed nap on Saturday and yesterday stupid early start was the tipping point.\\
Sounds about right for how stupid the human body works. "Here are drugs to fix you"\\Body - "Thanks, dont worry though. I've found a way to work round them and go back to the old ways. You can keep taking them if you like. They are like sweets for me now"\\Yeah, will be the chicken. Got 5 portions of it to go through this week.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to try :smiling-face: I'm just going around pottering and yawning. I'll take one more drug before bed and hopefully will wake up much better.\\
Haha, literally. My body is a dick.\\Also, you know what I found out yesterday - apparently you need to up your water intake if taking creatine. So the combination of that and SSRIs I need to be chugging loads\\It's good chicken!\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You still taking a bath? CBD stuff and maybe melatonin for bed.\\
Be nice to my girlfriend. I really like her. :winking-face:\\I can believe that. It does seem to be the new generic answer to everything. Always be drinking water. If you think your drinking enough. WRONG, drink more :face-with-tears-of-joy:.\\I guess you didn't drink much while spending all morning in the sun either with your fear of the porta toilets\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I definitely was a dehydrated little raisin yesterday :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
But I did get some water and electrolytes in when I got home and today. But I do need to be more intentional.\\Also, I checked and the wellness grant should cover the whole year of lido.\\I see how I feel about the bath later. I sometimes can't take it if I'm feeling nauseous etc\\I'm trying to be very nice to her :smiling-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: going to have to start carrying a water bottle around then :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
do you have one of these \url{https://www.superdrug.com/health/diet-fitness/water-bottle/vidrate-reusable-timer-water-bottle/p/mp-00002642}\\That's good about the Lido. WiIl you do that instead of Titan's\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've got like 3 :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
No, I'll keep titans definitely. I really just want the pool\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh hello :smirking-face:\\
Did you set up when changing bed?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Pretty much yeah.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nice\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Looking forward to it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is a good start\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh dear. That must be bad. Is it helping?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes but it's such a weird feeling\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The pain or the tens machine\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The machine :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Is it like a strange tingling?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It shocks your muscles\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Like properly. Really weird feeling them moving without doing anything. I'll pop them on you when you're here next :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Erm, pass :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Is it helping\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You'd make all sorts of noises :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Tbh, yes. It's good for muscle pain\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Wish I could put myself into like a tens sock :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s why I’ll pass. I’ll squeak and you’ll like it too much and I don’t need to discover that I might like it but pretty sure I’d hate it.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So just 5 more machines all hooked up\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It has like sticky pads. Wish they were bigger and it's so hard to put them on my own back :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You might like it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hmmm, that’s the fear.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha why?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just don’t really need a new kink unlocked :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: or I at least don’t need you finding a new way to make me make funny noises\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: New kink is always good :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not pain ones\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It helps with pain!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't worry I won't make you try it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: \url{https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGeVGbabq/}\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: A pain kink helps with pain?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No the tense machine :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok, I got confused :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Spud would not be amused\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You never know!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i'm pretty sure he'd have some thoughts if you bought a dog back to the flat\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well yes, my flat is definitely too small for the dog\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm all tucked in. Did you have a good evening?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: it was ok. Did play some games in the end. Very frustrating. I just do not understand how people can play a game for soooooo many hours and be so shit.\\
I'm about to go to bed as well. Assuming I dont accidentally get myself tied up in it.\\Has the tens machine helped at all?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh are you leaving them there until I come over?\\
Yes, it has helped a little\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah I’m not going to move the mattress around each time.\\
I hope you feel at least a bit better in the morning. More water :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\Night x x x x x x x x x x\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh are they the under mattress\/across ones?\\
Me too. Hopefully all the rest helps.\\Night night, sleep well xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: The 4 wrist\/ankle bracelets (for want of a better term). Are all connected. <This message was edited>\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x\\
I think that's a good idea, you need a proper rest day.\\Hope you manage to get some more sleep. Try stretching your neck when you get up, hopefully it will ease.\\I'm feeling better than yesterday morning so hopefully that's a good sign\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yesterday was meant to be a rest day or Thursday and Friday this week :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:. The rest shouldn’t kill me though.\\
Glad you’re feeling a bit better. More water.\\I’d hope it’s a good sign.\\Have you gone to the office?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Saw this today\\
\url{https://www.reddit.com/r/Fibromyalgia/s/dlIYtBL0Sg}\\We need to spend a bit of time and sort you out a few things. Pillow, new blanket, heated blanket?\\Nail mat thingy\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You had Hannah yesterday so definitely not a rest day!\\
Yes will try to get more water into me today.\\I'm just having breakfast, then meds then office :smiling-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I read that yesterday and was definitely making a mental list :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think the body pillow and Shakti mat will be first and then a new weighted blanket\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: In the nicest most loving way. Can you make that into a physical or digital list so that you don’t forget :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
100\% pillow is needed and a new weighted blanket. Don’t know if that will then need a cooling mat or something so you don’t get too hot.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy: okay I'll make a physical one\\
Cooling weighted blanket might be a good idea\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You can use all your new stationary :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Does work offer you a proper chair to wfh or and sort of credit to buy one? I worry about the chair you have for long term use as I know it would cripple me\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, I can!\\
Not sure to be honest\\But I will be getting a comfy sturdy one when I'm sorting the dining corner\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: “The *shrine* of *emptiness*”\\
That’s good. It made such a difference to me when I bought a good office chair.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Do you have time this weekend for a bit more flat sorting?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah on Sunday?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
*Cat* *corner*\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: We can do that\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What's your plan for today?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: He doesn’t even sit in it if you move his carpet. It’s the shrine of emptiness. :squinting-face-with-tongue:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I need to get moving. Breakfast and then revise.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Might de-fluff my pillow as well.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm sending productive vibes for the day\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thanks. I hope you feel better today. Surviving the corporate world\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you. Me too. Such a weird day yesterday.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Weird how?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just feeling so so weird all day\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00018582-GIF-2024-06-04-09-55-28.mp4>\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: How are you doing?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm okay. Catching up on some work slowly :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's the brain?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Brain is mush. I really don’t like exams. Well I don’t like the process of revision as it makes you feel stupid. Neck is pissing me off as well. Of all the things I do I hurt myself sleeping.\\
Just got to keep going.\\Water :sweat-droplets: :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I can imagine. You can do it. 3 more days\\
You should theragun it, might help\\I've had loads today. You??\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I've drunk some but probably not enough\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Water :sweat-droplets::sweat-droplets::sweat-droplets:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you made it home ok?\\
All set for book club?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just got home. Went to get a food shop, then eyebrows. Bookclub is getting rescheduled I think, too much life happening\\
How's your day been?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: At least gives you a chance to rest a bit more.\\
Had a breakdown, questioned life choices, got through it,\\Now about to shower have dinner and then start again. It’s a real pain the exam isn’t next week but never mind\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh lord. That doesn't sound too good\\
Can I do anything?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Only if you can explain how the reduced mass formula works in words a small child would understand. I need to look at it again but my brain cannot get it.\\
Otherwise just concentrate one rule 1\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I wish I could :pensive-face: hate that I can't help you with all of this. We'll celebrate on Friday :red-heart:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Your support is helping.\\
Looking forward to seeing you Friday. Thoughts for dinner. Could do steak? Only because I have sauce in the fridge and I think I have chips. No steak though :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\And then seeing you on Sunday as well not Saturday?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll bring steak :beaming-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
Yeah I'm brunching on Saturday\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I might try and do a park run somewhere and got to do some gardening as it green bin week.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh park run will be fun. Aw I wanna do gardening :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: There will be plenty of gardening to be done. I’m just going to attack the ivy and cut the grass.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okay :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was dinner?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was fine. Some of the carrot or swede isn’t quite as soft as last time.\\
Just trying to get the energy to go to a cash machine and then do some more work.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You eaten?\\
Bath today, more tens torture machine\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh why are you popping to a cash machine?\\
Yes, I made the pho. Really fancied some broth. I'm going to do the closing shift now and maybe read a little\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Need some cash to pay Hannah. My in house stash wasn’t as high as I thought and missing spin this morning meant I didn’t get any more out. Could risk it in the morning but know the machine won’t work and \/ or I’ll be late.\\
Closing shift :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh do you have Hannah again tomorrow? Are you not doing Friday anymore?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah 8am session. Just the last 2 weeks it’s been changed. Don’t need any distraction on exam day and Hannah goes on holiday Thursday for a week. Should be back to normal next week.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh of course :face-with-tears-of-joy: my bloody brain. It's not like I don't know :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone::woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
Everyone is going on holidays :loudly-crying-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Next week or beyond we need to start looking at a holiday for November and the plan for us to be able to enjoy it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :smiling-face::smiling-face: I'd love that\\
Have you gone out for cash?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Cash obtained. Need to build my stash back up\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha house stash :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Such a foreign idea to me\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I like to have a couple of hundred kicking about "just in case"\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm lucky if I have £30 on me\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Of course :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: and then I generally like to have at least £40 in the wallet\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'd like that too but I forget :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well closing shift took longer :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: just got into bed. Have you been up to much post cash adventure?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You want to talk to management about these closing down procedures. They are taking ages. What do you even do?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh well done!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't even know what any of that is. You clever clogs\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: what it is is pain. The example they give us missing a very critical step (for me at least)\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: silly fractions\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha. Well, I made lunch for tomorrow, did the dishes, wiped down the kitchen counters, changed Spud's water. Then I did my face routine, cleaned the litter, washed up and bed\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: fancy pants making lunch\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha I know. I had canteen today\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to say night night now x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
Hope you sleep well.\\Love you. Loads :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night Night x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
\section*{Wednesday $05\textsuperscript{th}$}
I'll be off to bed in a minute. Brain is mush. Might as well try to rest it for tomorrow\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00018637-GIF-2024-06-05-06-57-26.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x\\
Ah that's good. Did you sleep well?\\It's always a little weird when your established routine moves just a bit.\\I'm feeling okay. Definitely much better compared to Monday\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Slept ok at least. Can’t really believe I went to bed so early. Fucking exams.\\
That’s good. Pleased you’re feeling better. Where on the scale though. I’m thinking Monday was pretty close to that Sunday you woke up at my house. Then there was a couple of Fridays ago you were leaping around like a bunny rabbit.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 3 more days and then you can have a breather :smiling-face:\\
Monday wasn't great at all. I think I'm somewhere in the middle, not leaping around but not crying :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok so “much better” means “able to function and not crying”. I’d have put you about 25\% up from the jumping bunny scale not 50\% based on what you said.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: At least todays paired question wasn’t about presents\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha, at least\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well I'm in pain like a 6, but not so sleepy I can't function\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did the new drugs do much or just make you feel weird\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Made me feel weird and tingly but did take away some of the pain\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Seems quite unfair that either your body or the drugs or both seem to give 50\/50 on drugs. 50\% the drug sort of works and then 50\% extra side affects.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah it's all just that. But hey ho, better than in December. Silver linings and all\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The trend line is definitely going up. Which is great. The body is just sooo slow at reacting positively and will very quickly fall back down the stairs.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Slow progress is still progress. I'm trying not to fall back down the stairs :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Definitely don’t fall down actual stairs :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
More water :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Definitely. I went through bottle and half, 500ml protein drink, 3 teas and then fee glasses of water and 500ml electrolytes at home\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've peed so much :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Still not enough :face-with-tears-of-joy: and it has to be every day forever :weary-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll try again today.\\
And you should too!!! Water helps with the brain\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know. I’m trying\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know :smiling-face: hope Hannah session is good today\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Was a good session. Back to PB level on squats 2x5x120\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00018660-GIF-2024-06-05-09-37-17.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Woo hoo. Well done!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: <attached: 00018662-GIF-2024-06-05-09-51-26.mp4>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: haha, it does only get more expensive. I thought you were thinking of the super sprint. I mean you did see how fun it was\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you thinking of doing another one?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: my brain went into overdrive when all I saw to start with was "I've been thinking"\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh nooooooo\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: then I saw the laughing face\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll sit with it until Sunday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: how they get you is that you book it a year in the future thinking it is ages away. Then BAM its nect week\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll need to sort bike and wet suit though\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: you wanted a wet suit anyway and the bike is a solvable problem\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: 11 months to sort\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you thinking of doing another one?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: maybe. I haven't thought about too much yyet\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's revision going?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: as always. Very slow\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: trying to crack an equation then will do lunch\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did you crack it?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm in and out of meetings again. Had lunch at desj\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: nope and its put me in a bad mood. Which isn't helping at all. I can just feel all the little mistakes I'm going to make on this exam now and that before I get to the stuff I just don't know\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: desk food bad. Makes the keyboard dirty\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't get this into your head. You're already preplanning the mistakes. Take a step back and try again :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I have a 4.30 meeting :face-with-rolling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Doh, they are always pointless. I tried to avoid those\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It was a "connect" :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :face-vomiting:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's brain?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: slightly broken. I've got my robot meeting later at Duncan's house. So about to get dinner and go from there.\\
I'm at the point I wanted to be at yesterday. Just have to learn faster tomorrow\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: New day tomorrow! You can do it.\\
At least nerdy meeting will help reset the brain\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: that's the hope, just a bit of a shame I dont have much to show them since last time.\\
What are you master plans tonight? Have you spoke to management about speeding up or reducing your closing up shop duties :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's ok that you don't. You've had other things to concentrate on.\\
Definitely a bath tonight, I am hurty. Need some dinner before and that's about it :beaming-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Im sorry you’re still suffering. Bath is always good. Hopefully a couple of WFH days will help.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It will be okay, just a blip. Will have an omelette and bath.\\
Also... I quite like this new job :beaming-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: What’s prompted that?\\
I’m really glad you like the new job. I always thought you would and will be good at it\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What's prompted what?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The comment about liking the job\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh nothing in particular. I just felt I've had good work days. I so rarely used to have a day when I got home and was like yeah today was good\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yay.\\
That is really good. It was one of the reasons to change jobs.\\It is better when you enjoy work. Especially given how long you have to do it for\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have fun at nerdy nerd meeting :red-heart:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Closing shift done and in bed.\\
How was your evening?\\I'm going to say night night now x x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Evening is nice. Good to reset.\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x\\
Oh no. Are you hurting loads?\\I went for an early walk with Katie and had a little nap after I got back :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not loads but I expected the pain tomorrow as squats always seems to skip a day before the pain kicks in.\\
Oh well done. That’s a good start to the day. I thought Katie walk coffee was a Friday thing.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh it's not really a fixed date\/time. She just had time too and I'm thinking about doing gym tomorrow\\
What's the plan for last day of revision?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah that’s the plan. Just rotate around revision, tears, drinks and food\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good plan. Just try less tears :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Good luck with it all\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Alive?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just about. Soo behind where I want to be but soldiering on.\\
You back home? Plans for the evening?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I was WFH today. Just about to take myself to the gym, haven't really moved much today.\\
You can do it! Have you been taking breaks? Water?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: OF COURSE you were at home :man-facepalming::man-facepalming:\\
Yeah I've had breaks and trying to drink. Resisting the booze :face-with-tears-of-joy:. Haven't left the house\\Enjoy the gym, might be warm now. I would say dont go super mental\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm not going to go super mental :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Glad you've had breaks and water. Resist booze! You'll be able to have something tomorrow :smiling-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you survived the gym?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I have.\\
Have you had dinner yet?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, just finished dinner and a bit of a break. Back on it now. How was the gym?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't over do it bub. You need to get some proper rest tonight\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know. The quizzes I have worked through have taken soo much longer than I thought. Hopefully it was the right idea. Want to go through all of the answers to the sample exam paper and see if there are any gaps in the notes I've been making \/ code I;ve prepared\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm sure it was! They must be there to help you out. Hopefully the specimen papers help too. You're doing so well !\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How did the specimen paper go?\\
I just got into bed, really knackered today.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: it went ok. Hopefully the questions tomorrow aren't just reworded version as a couple of the questions are super hard even with the answer. Lots of silly equation manipulation which I really cannot believe is what they do day to day. Will just have to see.\\
Pretty much closing down now. Not going to learn anything new before tomorrow.\\Well you were up early for your walk plus going to the gym.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well done for doing all the work!\\
Now rest your brain, get some water in you and sleep.\\Night night x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\Hope you sleep well\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well done!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Was it really hard?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Very. More time might have helped but one whole question I pretty much have zero idea how to solve and each part needed the last answer.\\
At least 2 questions I know I know but couldn’t do.\\Not at all the topics I was expecting and as always stuff in the exam I don’t even remember reading the first time. Let along revising.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You've done what you can. It's out of your hands now. take a breather, have some water and food :red-heart:\\
Any idea when they might release results?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Someone said 7 weeks for results. I’ve not looked into it but it will be a while.\\

That's a good lay in. Did you rest well?\\I've literally had the crappies sleep. Kept waking up and not being able to get back to sleep and then I just got up at 7 and got ready for gym\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s a good lie in but I don’t feel particularly rested :man-facepalming: will try again tomorrow.\\
Oh no that’s so shit. Even with the drugs!\\We Gotta change something then. Tomorrow or today let’s get that pillow and new blanket ordered.\\Have you been and gone to the gym then?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: The chat for my exam yesterday has opened back up. Seems like ever hated it and quite a few people ran out of time. Feels like they might have made the exam too hard for the time allowed.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup gym been and done, got home when you texted .\\
I don't even know why I kept waking up. Cat was sleeping the whole time so it's not him. I don't know\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh. That might mean that they will have to adjust the boundaries which could be a good thing\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Maybe you just soo excited for the day to start :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sure sure :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Maybe, I won’t count on it. It’s just as likely that the people who did the worst want to talk about how shit it was.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I guess you'll see. But if they made it too hard and enough people lodge complaints it might change something\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to have breakfast, shower and get ready. What's the plan for you?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It might change things. Will just have to see. There will always be someone who aced it.\\
Think I’ll just bum around now that I’m unemployed :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\Breakfast with donut :doughnut: then have a stab at some gardening\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You should definitely bum around a bit. More than deserve it :smiling-face:\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha well done!\\

Super spicy :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\Enjoy the shower. Are you going to relax after?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is the plan.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How’s lunch?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It was really lovely. Just popped to the snug for s drinky\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The snug! Can remember the last time I went there. Enjoy\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Do you have a thingy that detects studs and cables  in walls?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i think i had one once but it never worked\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: who needs one?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no worries. We were just talking about Nicky having to drill in brackets for her wardrobe into the wall\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: wont that flat all be brick?\\
You could try just measuring out from the wall. There should be a stud spaced 16 or 24 inches. Then you can drill a few holes to find the stud. Assuming its not just a brick wall.\\I do have some pretty good plaster board strong screw things. If its just something to stop it toppling over\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you :smiling-face-with-hearts: we were just brainstorming :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your afternoon been?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i seem to have blinked and missed the afternoon. After packing up, showering and having lunch it was nearly 4pm. My tutor asked about the exam so have sent feedback and a couple of other people on the course wanted info on my cosmology course. So have sent that.\\
Just messing about on the computer now, might play a game\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You ended up having a busy day!\\
I'm just walking to the car and will drop Laura home and then do a quick food shop. Will pick you up some cleaning bits. Do you need anything else?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: A busy couple of hours at least. I think i'm ok thanks. I have stuff arriving Monday.\\
Just need to think about lunch tomorrow as I'm guessing we will be having lunch together. Either at yours or out somewhere. My mind isn't good with food on a Sunday as its normally locked in but will be different this week\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Do you just want me to get you some sausages and eggs ? I'm happy to do that\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That's cute but we dont have to have sausages unless you want.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm happy to do that. What kind of sausages would you like? And what else? I'm just in the shop\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: we could do sausage and egg rolls?\\
I normally get Cumberland but any sausages will do\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: they will work\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Which ones? And what kind of rolls\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: cumberland\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And rolls?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: erm, what ever bread rolls they have that a couple of sausages will fit in\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha okay\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Done :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What time are we going to the art show tomorrow?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Totally up to you. I could get to yours for 10 or 11 or 12. Eat then head over?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Are you looking at flights tonight?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Get to me for 11?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not yet\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That works.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've done it all :loudly-crying-face::loudly-crying-face::loudly-crying-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: All of what?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Flights and hotel\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done. :pound-banknote::pound-banknote::pound-banknote::pound-banknote:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: So expensive :pensive-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Flying from?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Heathrow\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: £800 all in?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Only other option was Gatwick and I would have to go day ahead both ways\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Pretty much\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Gatwick is such a pain.  Not worth it.\\
I can take you to Heathrow.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you :smiling-face-with-hearts: it will be early though\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m busy that day actually\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well it's a Friday so yeah\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What times\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I need to be there for 5.30\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ouch\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yah\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: At least I won’t need to cancel Hannah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm exhausted now :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What dates are they and I’ll add to my calendar so nothing else gets in the way\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 12-15july\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What time do you land on the 15th\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You can have a super long nap later :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 12.30\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Much more reasonable\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah, I think I will\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Still will have to leave the hotel at like 7am\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh yeah. A wake up to go home type deal.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The village is like an hour away from Toulouse and then to airport\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Scratch that. 2hrs :upside-down-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh. How are you getting about once you get there?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Bus to train station, then train and then no idea because there are no cabs in the village :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone: will speak to be to figure something out\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Why has she chosen a place so far away?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Because it's beautiful\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't know\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I hope it’s nice.\\
So tomorrow we can look at pillows. Maybe a single sheet size travel weighted blanket. They don’t weight hand luggage\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It looks amazing tbh and I know it will be lovely. But you know how I am. And I won't even be able to go home\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh as in you won’t be able to pop back to the hotel.\\
That’s kinda how weddings go. Your “stuck” there until the end.\\Hopefully you’re not the only one at the hotel you’ve chosen. Might be able to share rides\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: More like actually home home :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
They do have a shuttle service between the venue and the hotels so at least that. It's just getting to and from the hotel\/train station\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is the issue with going away. Your not at home :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
For most people that is the point\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But you know meeeee. I'm a home body :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: As am I.\\
You do know if you go away in November you won’t be at home :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeeea but that will be by a pool with no obligations :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It is nice when you have your room, pool is literally outside the door and you just walk to get food and drinks.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I can't even remember that. Last time I was on holiday was actually with Bev about 8 years ago\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Nearly been that long for me.\\
It’s exciting to think about going on holiday with you.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It is :smiling-face: I might have already started looking\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Finally in bed.\\
Hope you had a nice chilled evening.\\Night night x x x x x x x x x x x\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Pretty chill. Watching qualifying.\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
I've been up before 6 again :face-with-rolling-eyes:\\Not yet, I was just having a quick look. Morocco seems quite cheap, but there are options in the Canaries too.\\Did you sleep well?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: This is becoming a pattern now. Something has to have changed or it just the light \/ outside noise waking you up.\\
Have you tried an eye mask?\\Morocco is definitely cheap.\\I slept, alarm woke me up. So that’s something.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I have been a bit hurty recently so it might just be pain waking me up without me realising.\\
I've tried it but I can't have anything on my face.\\We can have a look together at some point.\\I'm going to get up, shower and get ready\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: On the way\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm alive\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s very much preferred.\\
Up and not crying?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just about up but definitely not crying :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
How are the games?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Games are shit and we don’t know why.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh nooo. Are neither of you playing well?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Seems so. Just no rhythm or flow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh boo. Hopefully at least one of them will be decent\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you feel any better after your nap?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes I did tbh\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s good\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have you figured out what's for dinner?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep, sausage roll, chicken nuggets, a bit of cheese. The meat sticks you bought yogurt and some crisps for the race.\\
I assume you hunted for food ok?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's a truly picky tea :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
Are the meat sticks nice?\\I did. Had some pasta and a little ice lolly for afters\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Meat sticks are brilliant. :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aw I'm glad you like them\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How’s the closing shift going?\\
Race was good. Finally. Rain always makes it better.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just about done :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
Glad it was good! Where was it?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Canada this week. Back to Europe now for the summer.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh nice. Are you getting ready for bed?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Will do in a bit. Just watching a bit of you tube but I am tired today.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think you are starting to come down from the weeks of exam adrenaline. Bumming around for a bit will be good for you :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah I think so as well. Tomorrow might be a bit odd but will do spin, shopping is arriving. I can throw dinner in the slow cooker and then I’m free :grinning-face:\\
Want to do some robot stuff.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That sounds like a good plan. Just don't be too productive :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Right I'm all tucked in bed.\\
Night night x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done.\\

Are you alright? Did you go to spin?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00018926-GIF-2024-06-10-08-21-04.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no! That's rubbish. I'm sorry you had a crap night. Try to reset yourself and maybe go for a walk later?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Might go for a walk. If it stops raining.\\
Good luck with your training\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00018929-GIF-2024-06-10-08-43-35.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's so yucky outside :nauseated-face: hopefully it clears\\
What else is on your relaxing day list?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good day to not have the puppy really.\\
Grabbing breakfast while waiting for my shopping. Then will try out cooking a chilli in the slow cooker. Then it will be robot time.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Make sure it's a relaxing day too :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
Enjoy\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I'm not really sure why but I got thinking about shelved and tea storage.\\
In that corner of your kitchen we could get some simple pine boards to make up some shelves. Almost like corner shelves but bigger to it goes to the edge of the window. Then I found these for tea storage?\\\url{https://www.amazon.co.uk/G-HOMEFAVOR-Storage-Organizer-Capsules/dp/B0B56G9XWF}\\\url{https://www.amazon.co.uk/KICHLY-Plastic-Holder-Pack-Organizer/dp/B0BR5BJBG9}\\I think the second one might be better as its all closed but still see through.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hope training is going well\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh corner shelves are a great idea! Thank you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Brain is absolute mush\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your day going?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: going ok so far just a bit delayed. about to cook lunch.\\
Keep going with the training. Make notes. It will stick.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What are you making for lunch?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: same as yesterday. Got 2 sausages to use up :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha. I'm glad you're making use of them:smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Finished. How's robot stuff going?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: not brilliantly. I have absolutely no idea why it turns the wrong direction and it doesn't even turn the right amount. All very confusing\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: is the training done?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that's bizarre. Does Duncan or someone from the hacker group have an idea why that might be?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup all done. I am shattered\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I'll ask the robot group when I can work out a nice way of explaining it and I have the hacker group meeting on Wednesday I can bounce idea's off. Feells like it is something super simple.\\
Well done. Nap time or you getting ready to go out? Or is flat dinner tomorrow\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's a good plan! They might see something.\\
Getting ready to go out :sleeping-face:\\Flat dinner is tomorrow, just seeing Jenny in town\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That should be fun at least. I knew id get the day wrong. Does mean I have completely forgotten what you are doing on Wednesday\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm supposed to be catching up with Michelle :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also- paired!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have made progress on the mouse :man-facepalming::man-facepalming::man-facepalming::man-facepalming::man-facepalming::man-facepalming::man-facepalming::man-facepalming::man-facepalming: Like an absolute PLUM I had the direction controls mixed up. So I was telling the wrong motor which direction it should travel in. Explains why it would go forward but not turn. Damn that took way to long to find.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yay! Well done! Is it going the right way now?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It seems so. Which is good. I can move on to setting up the sensors now.\\
How’s was your Meetup with Jenny?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Wooo hoo, you clever clogs. Well done for figuring it out.\\
Catch up was good, haven't seen her in a while :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\Also heard that Aldi had Shakti mats in!\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Is that a Shakti pillow? :face-with-head-bandage:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah but I've just stood on it and it's not very prickly :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I bet it is\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Although I’m guessing it’s not like standing on Lego\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No, I've had pricklier ones\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll have some food and then will have a lie down\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Aldi beginner spec level of pain mat\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha yeah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Will try it out and see\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I hope it helps though\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What are you having for dinner?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I made chilli in the slow cooker. Was really good. I maybe should have made it into 6 portions instead of 5.\\
Unfortunately no good for you as I’ve got 2 sets of beans in it.\\I think it could be better if cooked for longer. Only got 6 ish hours in it\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: What have you found?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What did you think of my tea storage idea's\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that sounds nice! Glad you enjoyed it.\\
I'm making an omelette :beaming-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I like it!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not the shelf idea the 2 things to go on the shelf?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oooh. For some of it yes! But I also need to figure out how to store the tea that's bit individually packed and the loose tea :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Felt the boxes would be better for cat and just seeing stuff\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think you're right. Things get dusty here\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I might get some jars for the loose tea\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah some jars would work well.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, a good idea.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But I'll have to have a party in the summer :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your evening been?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s been ok. Playing games. An actual win so far and not truly terrible. A nice change\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you done anything?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah well done!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Uhm, no not really :grimacing-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s a good evening then\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Or you could use\\
“I don’t really like people”\\So subtle\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Its like he pretends to like you, as cats dont like to admit they like anyone but really they need human contact\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I;m explaining it badly\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ha, no this a good explanation :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm in bed now. Hope you a few more good games.\\
Night night. Sleep well x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night Night. I'm just off to bed as well.\\
\section*{Tuesday $11\textsuperscript{th}$}
The games went very much down hill. We peaked early today.\\Enjoy your nap.\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00018996-GIF-2024-06-11-06-09-34.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x\\
Glad the alarm worked :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\I slept so so, still woke up a few times.\\I'm sure you'll be able to potter around downstairs and do some bits and pieces.\\Hope spin is good :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Another shit spin class done. Good news. We have a new instructor for Thursday. So that’s exciting.\\
I realised we hadn’t talked about when we are seeing each other this week. Thoughts?\\It looks like I’m out during the day Saturday. Not boating but top golf.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: God Joseph is useless. But yay for new instructor - do you know anything about them?\\
No we haven't - how about Friday and something during the day on Sunday?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Nope will find out Thursday.\\
That sounds good. I’ll check with Dad but did you want to come to lunch as well? I was going to suggest Osaka to dad for father day as Mum would never go.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I can come with you if you want. But equally if you just want to spend time with dad one on one that's absolutely fine :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Dad is better at opening up just one on one. I’ll see what he wants to do. I might suggest we go over on Sunday for a drink maybe lunch. Then I take him to Osaka Monday or Tuesday when it’s not mega busy for father day. Maybe tie it in with a cinema visit\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Then Sunday could be us going to my parents (if you want) then we can try and build some furniture.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: So sexy, both of you :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You do what works best :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: we can definitely do a cuppa or something at your parents on Sunday!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Give her a belly rub\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Today is mental!\\
What are you two up to?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: We’ve made it to mum and dads for a bit. Then not sure when I get back. Will see if she is calm :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Say hello from me\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am shattered\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did you to make it back home?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah made it home about an hour ago. Took ages with all the roadworks and cool traffic.\\
Mark just picked up puppy. I’m FREE :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\I don’t know why but I am absolutely ruined.\\Did your training course day thingy go ok?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sunday. Going to my parents first 11:30 for lunch.\\
No pressure at all but did you want to try and make the carrot cake you were talking about?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah well done! Did you have a good day?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sounds good.\\
I can try but can't promise it will all go to plan :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Day was pretty good. Lexi is hard work. You can’t do anything else. Cannot really be trusted in the garden and cannot be trusted on her own in the house. So just full on all day.\\
I only suggested it as you said you wanted to make one.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I bet! It's like looking after a toddler.\\
Oh I'd definitely like to do it. Just can't guarantee the end result :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\What are you up to tonight?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh no. A toddler would be much much worse.\\
Not quite sure yet. I sort of skipped lunch and had a dog friendly snack so I might eat early. Then I think games or robot.\\What time is flat dinner?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, but would it?\\
They are trying to eat what they shouldn't, play with what they shouldn't and generally trying to injure themselves.\\Chilli for dinner?\\Dinner is at 6. All I want to do is go to bed\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Toddlers do exactly the same thing but succeed more more often at hurting themselves. Definitely rather look after a puppy than toddler.\\
Yeah chilli for dinner :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\:smiling-face-with-hearts: well, you can go to bed after food and at least this way you don’t have to cook or clean up.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh me too :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
I'm so looking forward to bed already :grinning-face:\\It's been so full on these last two days I haven't actually manage much of my actual job\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's mum feeling?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The work you’ve done is your job. Otherwise you wouldn’t have had to do it.\\
Mum is starting to feel a lot better. Drugs seem to have worked. Couple more days I recon.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well my to do list only grew, no ticks :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
I'm glad she's doing better. There are some horrendous bugs making the rounds\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You ticked off training and ticked off what ever the official name for today was.\\
The todo list is never done. The trick is to quickly identify the tasks that don’t need doing and not do them\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Today was just a day with meetings and training :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s still all stuff that needed to be done.\\
It’s very easy to think you’re not working because other stuff is getting in the way. That stuff is also work and as long as people know when work will be completed it’s all good.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Home! How's your evening going?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Its going ok. Not really done much.\\
How was dinner?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What did you get up to?\\
Dinner was lovely - nice to catch up with the girls\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Watched a bit of a film while having dinner. No games with Matt but just played a bit to level a gun we need to use. Just about to have a stab at some robot stuff and then probably an early ish night\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Are you working on your closing shift?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh what did you watch?\\
Sounds like a good relaxing evening! That's what you're supposed to be doing :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nope. I've just had a lay down on the prickly mat :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I started "The accountant" again\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: no closing shift today?\\
How is the stabby mat\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I only have one bowl in the sink.\\
Stabby mat is actually quite nice\\And I'm already in bed :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I really have no idea what your closing shift it. I some how imagine counting up the days taking, sweeping the floor, folding washing, going through checklists\\
I'm glad the mat is good.\\This is more of a "normal" bed time for you\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It is. I am pooped so hopefully will sleep.\\
Hope robot stuff goes well and night night when you go to bed x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night Night x x x x x x\\

I slept some. How about you? You're up early for a lay in day.\\Yup I have 3 assessment centres today :grimacing-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I set the alarm for 7:30. I was asleep before 11.\\
Some doesn’t sound like a lot.\\Phew, my brain has gone to complete garbage.\\Good luck with it all. Does this count as work in your mind or is this still work that doesn’t count\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I did at least manage to not knacker my shoulders sleeping last night\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It definitely counts as work :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Glad shoulders are not achey. What's the plan for today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ve got a list for today.\\
A decent walk\\Clean the kitchen\\Try and sew some grass seeds in the garden\\More robot stuff\\Hacker group meeting this evening\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's a good list! Hope you have a good day :red-heart:\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Busy :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your day?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s going ok. Bit of sucess with the robot. Just about to make lunch. Not gone for a walk yet.\\
Keep going. :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Woo hoo on robot success. Well done :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Super boring. I got an email today saying that M\&S bank have a 0\% interest on credit transfers for 15 months.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not boring at all. I do need to have a look at these at some point\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It says the offer is around until the end of the month\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll get to it at some point :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Had a good afternoon?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: maybe :man-shrugging: afternoon seemed to go quick and i'm in that stuck phase because i'm going out later. I have done a bit more gardening. Thrown down some more grass seed on the dirt and tried to rough it in with the rake and water. Now got to water everyday and see what happens. Went for a quick walk.\\
Been looking at some stunningly boring paperwork that is needed or this company we are setting up to buy the building for my brother.\\How has work gone?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh wow, you've been super productive! Well done but make sure you rest too.\\
Work was mental (but not stressful, just super busy) just about to head to Michelle's. What time is nerdy group?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: nerd group is at 7:30 tonight. Hopefully its interesting.\\
I've had loads of time doing nothing as well\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good! You can tick off your list slowly :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you got any thoughts for anything you would like to do Friday?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I haven't had a chance to think. How about you?\\
But could we maybe make the spam fried rice?:pleading-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: The only thought I’d had is that I hadn’t had any thoughts.\\
Yes I can do spam rice. That’s a good idea.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm happy to just hang out, have dinner, maybe go for a walk\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have fun at nerdy group\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thanks.\\
Sounds like a great plan for Friday.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope you've had a nice evening. I'm off to bed\\
Night night x x x x x x x x x x x x\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just got back. It was ok. Not the best but still gives me a few ideas.\\
\section*{Thursday $13\textsuperscript{th}$}
So many project to do and so little time :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\Night x x x x x x\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00019075-GIF-2024-06-13-06-15-00.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x\\
I slept some :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\Yup, last day and hopefully not as busy\\How did you sleep?\\Oh I hope the class is good!\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I seem to have slept fast. Got to sleep later than ideal even though I went straight to bed. Takes time to decompress.\\
Today is a “normal” office day or is training still happening?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It does. That's why I always potter :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Yup, normal office day. Really hoping I can just get on with stuff\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You’ll get stuff done and what ever the stuff is will be your work. It just won’t necessarily be the work you want to do.\\
If you haven’t already it might be worth going over it with your manager to check what she thinks. It’s easy to think you’re not working but everyone else thinks you are.\\Also in response to your paired answer. I need cheering up everyday :squinting-face-with-tongue:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, bet you do!\\
How was spin?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Spin was good. Started off a bit rough and the instructor is pretty quiet. Lots of upper body stuff. Heart rate was mental high and a 45 minute class. So proper knackered now.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That sounds better than Joseph's classes.\\
What's the plan for today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: In the end it was better. Needs more people and the guy just needs to yell more.\\
Today is hopefully manly mouse day as I’m not going anywhere for the rest of the day. Got to water the garden :man-facepalming:\\Going to treat the driveway and also have a couple of house jobs to do.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Scratch treating to drive. It’s meant to rain today.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Manly mouse day? :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Mainly mouse day. Robot stuff\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've just had a 1:1 with Amanda and apparently I can take annual leave in October\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Are you not meant to take annual leave before that then?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I technically can but the point is I don't need to wait until November and end of probation\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: ahh ok. Is there some significance to October over September?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: obviously avoiding school holidays is a good idea\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not really, just thought beginning of Oct might be nicer temperatures and cheaper\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: True, would need to sit on a holiday site and play with dates to see when the cheap time is\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes definitely. And narrow down some destinations\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You can ask my Mum on Sunday. She's done a few holidays away in October November for sun\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh good idea!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's manly mouse going?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: delayed. Jobs got in the way. Might have found a brick person\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oooh exciting\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hopefully\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: will see\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The one from your neighbour?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No, from my friend Ross. Knows his work etc.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that sounds good\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to be in the office once next week, on Monday. Then Tue\/wed off site in Marlow and then WFH Thur\/Fri\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: OFF SITE, exciting. What's that for?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's for the first lot of the academy training stuff\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not really sure what in supposed to do there :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Observe would be my first guess. Just get exposure to what they do\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Probably\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Meetings meetings meetings. Can't wait to WFH tomorrow :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: so that you can do your meetings at home :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Boooo. Actual stuff tomorrow :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm still at work :neutral-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That not good. Everything can become a tomorrow problem\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not today. But it's done now. And Amanda told me to take some time back tomorrow Just wrapping up. How's your afternoon?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That's good at least. Its been ok. I think I have made progress. Got an issue if the robot is off center. The sensor readings go a bit off. Going to take a bit of a break and see what the brain comes up with over dinner\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: She's super supportive and keeps saying to take my time.\\
Good plan. Am pooped. Will go home and eat\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s good as well.\\
Have you got dinner all sorted?\\Are you just pottering this evening?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No I don't. I need to hunt\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good luck, I don’t even have a suggestion. Some sort of pasta maybe?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Probably. I'm all hurty so something easy.\\
Are you having chilli?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah chilli. Had to cook brown rice and cooking enough for tomorrow.\\
Is this all part of the same flare? I’m sorry you’re hurting so much over the last couple of weeks.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh did you run out?\\
To be honest, I think I've just been doing a little too much since I stopped teaching. I haven't been pacing myself. It's my first evening at home this week. I need to do better\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you spending the evening working on your mouse?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Morrisions ran out so could only order brown.\\
It makes sense a little that you’re excited to do things. That just wasn’t even a thought when you were teaching.\\Maybe Tuesday and Thursday need to be quiet days.\\Maybe a CBD bath and or the spike mat?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, that brilliant\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've been doing spike mat every night before bed for 5-10 mins :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
Yeah, it's definitely that. And to be honest, this and next week are the only properly busy weeks at work and that can't be helped. It would be very boring if it was super quiet all the time\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: True and it’s always a sine wave. Either everything or nothing\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And yes will be trying more mouse stuff after dinner\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll try to pace myself better next week :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00019134-VIDEO-2024-06-13-21-31-00.mov>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh my god. That's amazing!! Well done :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: very very pleased to have got this far. Not quite sure about the way it does a couple of things but now I can really start to do stuff\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly, so well done! Very proud of you.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm just getting into bed. Hope you sleep well. Night night x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I was about to say that early but just seen the time.\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x\\
I did sleep some again, woke up a couple of times.\\I'm just out for a little stroll with Katie. Oh and need to set up my new monitor when I get back :beaming-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\Oh nice! It always feels weird when the routine shifts by a little bit.\\Hope you have a good session.\\What's the plan for the day after?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh yeah your Friday morning walk that isn’t every Friday but it’s sort of is. :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Hope the monitor works this time.\\Today will fly by.\\Hannah, need to remember to buy some sort of bread for lunch on the way home, speaking to Chris, Lester is coming over for lunch.\\Then I might get a bit of time for something, then I get to see you :red-heart:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, yes.\\
Well it should. It's a proper external monitor and all. It's massive.\\Today sounds like a great day for you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: :hot-face::hot-face::hot-face::hot-pepper::hot-pepper::hot-pepper::hot-pepper:\\
We didn’t lift heavy things!\\I shouldn’t go food shopping t after the gym :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: £14 and I only wanted 4 rolls for lunch.\\I did get you something for later though. You’ll have to wait and see. Temper your excitement as it was from Tesco.\\I also bought a purple silicone thing you might get a laugh out of later as well. :squinting-face-with-tongue:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What did you do???\\
Okay I am way too excited about what you got me and a purple silicone thing (???)\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was a bunch of circuit work which included 45 seconds of 14kph on the treadmill. Didn’t want to admit that it wasn’t quite as awful as last time but still hurts twice.\\
You’ll just have to wait and see. With lowered expectations.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh circuits :face-screaming-in-fear: well done for getting them done\\
Okay...but please don't tell me in advance when you get me something, just surprise me. I am terrible at knowing there's something but not what\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: :face-with-rolling-eyes: ok. I'm sorry.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Why the :face-with-rolling-eyes:?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And no need to apologise, you didn't know. Just letting you know for future reference :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i'm not sure why the :face-with-rolling-eyes: felt the best one to use.\\
How am i suposed to do nice suprises, i dont do many so there isn't a risk of constant suprises\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh you can absolutely do surprises :beaming-face-with-smiling-eyes: just don't tell me in advance\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: but but that is sometimes the point of a suprise\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: it's still a surprise in the moment, no?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: yes but without the anticipation\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The anticipation gives me intense anxiety :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: clearly. I that becuase you worry about how your meant to react vs how you will react because that i totally understand\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes that's pretty much it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Any thoughts on timings for later?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 6ish? I need to shower and wash my hair\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your day been so far?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Been ok. My call with Chris didn’t happen for some reason. Lester has just left from lunch.\\
Just about to see what needs to be done and what I can do before I get to see you.\\Is work going better today? Are you able to do what you want.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no, he didn't message you?\\
Was lunch with Lester good?\\It's a bit better, still managed to have 3 meetings. Got a few things to finish up and hopefully done for the day\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: He just replied. His whole house has some stomach bug :face-vomiting:\\
Lunch was good. Has been a while since we’ve had a catch up. Might go for a beer tomorrow as well. Depends what time I get back.\\Good luck. Don’t accept any 4pm Friday meetings. Those are Monday problems.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Omg, everyone has it. One of my murder mates got admitted to hospital with it yesterday.\\
Ah I'm glad you had a good catch up.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
move the cat?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I'm guessing the afternoon has got away from you?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm leaving in 5. Sorry\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: ahh brilliant\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :red-heart:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Leaving\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just leaving Tesco's. I pottered :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh wow, that lots of pottering.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Tbh I was inside for only like 30-40 mins because it took like 15 to drive each way. Just parked at home. Did you get up to much?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Nope, I’ve sat :grinning-face:\\
30+ minutes in a super market is more than enough. Did you get anything nice,  beyond what you needed.\\Now you don’t need to leave the flat for 36 hours.\\Really enjoyed seeing you today :red-heart:. It had been weeks :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I love a potter around when it's this quiet, went through all the aisles :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Got some yogurts and bits in top of the stuff I needed. Got you some eggs, goats cheese and a surprise :face-with-open-eyes-and-hand-over-mouth:\\I loved seeing you too. It has been weeks! Thank you for cooking me dinner :red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: All the aisles :man-gesturing-NO: nope. :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Oh a surprise, how exciting. Thank you.\\You’re very welcome for cooking. I always like cooking when someone else is going to eat as well.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Fancy bread.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: 10g per slice. Wow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, I'm glad you're excited\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And costs less than my usual sourdough\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I wonder what they have added for the protein.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Pea protein\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Boo, want meat bread.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You can add that\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you made it to bed yet? Super later for you now. As I’m flagging a bit and just in my way.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm just on my way, was putting away shopping and chugging water. I'm so thirsty\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s so much water for you today\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know. I usually get through two of my bottles but just can't get enough today\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: See how you are tomorrow but that is a change in behaviour.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah. I know the meds can make me thirsty\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: True but you haven’t changed meds. It’s just interesting\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I know. Every little change weirds me out a bit\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Drinking more water is good and maybe it’s a hangover from a busy week\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That is absolutely possible\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm in bed!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done. Super late for you.\\
Night x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\Love you :red-heart:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know. I'll try to have a lay in tomorrow.\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
I did wake up for a bit twice but just about to get up now and definitely will be having a nap later.\\I hope you have a brilliant day with the guys. Are you doing the Watford top golf?\\Thank you. I can't wait :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah Watford. I’m not even sure where others ones.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Home.\\
How’s pottering going?\\Too golf was super fun. 4 games was too many though. 2 would have been more than enough.\\Wagamama’s was very meh. Loads of faff with really poor staff. Food is ok but standard too expensive for what you get.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm been cleaning all day. Just finished hoovering, but I did have a nap.\\
Oh I'm glad you had fun at top golf. How was the catch up with the guys?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done on the nap.\\
It was really good to see people again. Got to see Alex’s new place he has bought up in Scotland. An insane amount of land\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aw I'm glad!\\
Oh jealous of Alex's Scottish countryside. Where are they moving?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: He is moving somewhere near Inverness.\\
Seems that for the price of my house you can get a house of the same size and 22 acres of land.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I cry when I see the prices up north\\
For my flat I could have a 3 bed house\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: The problem is that you then have to live there and generally there is nothing there\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aaah details :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What are you up to tonight? Are you meeting Lester?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, he is picking me up at half past and we are going to the Spencer for a couple of drinks.\\
Have you finished cleaning now?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nice! Hope you have a good time.\\
Yes, just popped the cake in the oven\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oooh, cake :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I won't even be able to taste it to make sure it's okay :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It will be a surprise\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Perfect :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: If you followed a recipe it had to work out pretty well.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Meh, we'll see\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That looks amazing :star-struck:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I hope it tastes good too :grimacing-face:\\

Well done on not being hungover - did you drink quite a bit?\\I was up through the night again :woman-shrugging-light-skin-tone:\\Can't wait to see you later :red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I don’t think it was a huge amount maybe 4 pints total.\\
Oh no. That’s such a pain. Are you waking up for a while or just awake roll over back to sleep?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did you have a good time?\\
Waking up for a while and struggling to go back to sleep\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was fun, frustratingly expensive but fun. Very quiet in town which was odd. Either everyone at home watching the football or people just not going out.\\
That is frustrating and odd because this is new. Is it happening and any hour or always after 4am\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Glad it was fun. Where did you go?\\
Town is really quiet these days.\\It is definitely frustrating. It's always between 2-4, but usually around 3am\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Went to Heidrun because it was and did rain again. Then had one in the mad squirrel.\\
Maybe you need to do what people apparently did back in the day. Get up for an hour around 2-3am and potter. Then go back to bed\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: 2 sleeps\\
\url{https://www.headspace.com/articles/normal-wake-middle-night}\#\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I was up for about an hour last night. I just don't feel rested, but at the same time I know that's fibro\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: When are you going for your walk?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: 9am. I don’t think it’s going to rain. Then I’m aiming to pick you up at 11. Although I’ve told my parents 11:30\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Fingers crossed it doesn't rain. But it doesn't seem to warm\\
Yeah, 11 is good :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think I’m dressed wrong. Just shorts and t shirt. Don’t really want to be walking in jeans.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm sure you'll get warm walking :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just out of the shower. Will get dressed and come over. Do you need help carrying stuff from the flat?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki.\\
No, I just have the cake\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok I’ll message when leaving\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: On the way\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thank you for today. It was really nice of you to make the cake and I know my parents will have really appreciated it and enjoyed us being there.\\
:red-heart:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You're so welcome :smiling-face-with-open-hands: I enjoyed making it. It was lovely popping there.\\
Just woke up :sleeping-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Feel better for the nap\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not sure. Tbh I've been a bit nauseous today and it's just not going anywhere.\\
What are you up to?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Boo,\\
Been playing games. Something is up as we have had 3 wins and Matt and Seb have killed people. Must be the football\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh wow! Well done? I'm glad you're having some good time :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: New pillow? I hope\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s exciting. I really hope it makes a positive difference\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Me too!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Was it just the pillow or did you get something else as well?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No just the pillow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm all tucked in with my new pillow. Have you had a good evening?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, just had dinner after games and been watching TV.\\

Also, how's the pimple patch ? :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: The bread is a bit chewy. The texture is just a bit different to normal bread.\\
I had forgot it was on\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah I'll have a taste tomorrow.\\
Oh have a look for me :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It looks the same\\

I thought I slept really well but have woken up knackered.\\I’m sure spin will wake me up.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: About the same but slightly more awkward :face-with-tears-of-joy: woke up at 3 again and moved it.\\
Ah that's weird. Maybe the body is still getting used to not running on adrenaline. Spin will definitely wake you up\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good luck with your meetings today. Try not to let them see the eye roll when someone says something dumb :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you.\\
How was spin?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was packed! Don’t remember a class with so many people. Makes it soo much better.\\
Heart rate was mega high. Watch suggest a 56 hour recovery :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: as I’m just about to leave to see Hannah.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh god. Sounds like a good one. Hopefully Hannah won't destroy you completely. Have a good sesh\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s arms. I can always type with my nose :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Remember to walk about in between meetings.\\Water :man-facepalming:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00019283-GIF-2024-06-17-12-07-43.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh well done!!\\
What's the plan for the rest of the day?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just having lunch and then robot.  Should be playing some games later. So should be a more chill afternoon.\\
Have you done all your meetings or are they never ending?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Done loads, still more to come.\\
Sounds like a lovely day for you, enjoy :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also we haven't talked about when we're seeing each other this week\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sorry, started to reply and then my friend Carl turned up.\\
Yes we didn’t talk about this week. I’d assumed not today, Tuesday or Wednesday because of work. I’m out Friday night but I am free Wednesday or Thursday evening.\\Out Saturday but I’m around Sunday and thought we could try times stuff again without something before hand.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Crazy busy again.\\
Decided to stop at the gym seeing as the clothes were still in my car :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\It's well fancy\\How's your day been?\\Oh where are you out to on Fri? I'm in London on Friday too. Could do Thursday? I'm WFH.\\We could try times stuff?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Days been Ok. Carl dropping buy was a nice suprise as I haven't seen him this year but also 2 hours i hadn't planned.\\
Thursday works but we can call it on the day if you need time from the training stuff this week. What is the times stuff?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't know :face-with-tears-of-joy: it's your last sentence and I didn't understand\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: OH that was meant to be ikea stuff\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i should have tried to makes "times stuff" dirty somehow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha. Just finished in the gym. I'm well spicy. But also probably the strongest person here so there's that\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What are you up to tonight?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh the work gym. I very much suspect you are. Well done. :hot-pepper:\\
Will start dinner soon and either robot or games tonight.\\Are you doinng anything or trying to relex a bit before tomorrows mentalness\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What are you having for dinner?\\
I need to hunt some food, so hungry.\\Nicky is popping by for the bin but apart from that, just quiet evening\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: having pizza tonight as i've not made it for a while\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm quite jealous of that. Might have to have pizza this week :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Do you fancy a swim on Wednesday?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’d definitely go with you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. Let's do it :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: In a super nice and loving way could this be you doing a bit too much again this week?\\
I just know tomorrow is going to be a super long day.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You might be right. I'll see how I feel on Wednesday?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Let’s do that. Just see how you feel. Being by the lake would be nice. You would then get Thursday to fully decompress.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Will do that!\\
Did you have a good evening?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s been ok. Some frustrating games. The day just went. Can get back on the robot on Wednesday at least.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah yes, you have the velociraptor tomorrow :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, slight change of plan. I’ll have her in the morning. Go for a walk etc then take her to my parents and do the cinema tomorrow as they have a home to visit on Wednesday to go to. Give me a day back so that’s good.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah cool. Still seeing the same film?\\
Where are you taking dad for lunch?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Still seeing bad boys but will push lunch to next week\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah okay :smiling-face:\\
I'm just in bed. Hope you sleep well. Night night x x x x x x x x x x\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night Night x x x x x x x x x x x\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x\\
I think I actually slept for most of the night but I did wake up diagonal on the bed  with the cat getting the best of the pillow :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\Hope spin is good even though it's Joseph :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Aren’t you hugging the pillow? That’s good news on less waking up.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am but obviously keep changing positions during the night.\\
Just got to Marlow, a bit early\\When's the raptor arriving?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also just realised I can't go swimming tomorrow :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone: I've got Liddy at 7\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Of course. I knew I’d blocked Wednesday in my mind for some reason. You were going to go straight to bed once you get back.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh my god she's so big!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: When are you heading to the parentals?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just about to start rustling the raptor.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: NOW it wants to sleep :man-facepalming:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How is she now?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Overall? A bit calmer if I wasn’t about to leave she would be asleep until lunch. When she is on raptor mode you have to watch. It’s a shame I can’t leave her in the garden. She’d jump off the wall if I did\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I meant to write how old is she now :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: 6 months\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Enjoy the film!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was cinema?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was good. Film was better than the 3rd but still a ridiculous story line. Think it did Dad good to switch off for a little while. Still ended up being expensive £44 all in with car park and M\&S snacks.\\
How’s today gone. Are you at the BBQ  now?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Glad you had a good time :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
Yup still here , hopefully will leave by 7\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What are you up to tonight?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just getting ready to leave again to go to Becky’s for dinner.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh is that tonight? Completely thought it was next week\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep today. Not really stopped today in a weird way\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sounds like it. Enjoy\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your evening going?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Been good. Fun to catch up. Will be leaving soon.\\
Late for you. You made it to bed yet\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I just got back when I texted. Just heading to bed.\\
Hope Becky is doing well\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night x x x x x x x x x x\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning xxx xxx\\
Don't know if easier. Earlier and more involved . They seemed to have liked the BBQ. I had bookclub yesterday.\\How was last night?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh wow. Double busy day for you yesterday then.\\
Last night was really fun and Becky seems to be doing quite well. I’ll tell you about her friend  who seems to be living a real soap opera life.\\Hope today goes well for you\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah I'm glad she's doing well.\\
What's the plan for today for you?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just getting ready to start robot stuff. Will see how much far I can get today\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00019356-GIF-2024-06-19-13-21-12.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :red-heart:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your day been?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Its been ok. Been working on the robot but going around in circles a bit. Recently found a bug that might be nothing or important but it is confusing.\\
How are you doing?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah hoping you can work the bug out. Do you have any plans tonight?\\
I'm tired and kind of feeling out of sorts. Can't really describe it\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: only planning on working on the robot. Matt has gone on holiday so no games.\\
Oh thats odd. You have had a busy week already. Hopefully Liddy will help\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh where did he go?\\
Yeah just feel really meh. Bit foggy, bit nauseous, very tired. Really hoping she'll sort me out\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: still the same nauseous from the weekend?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes and no. I know that answer is not very helpful. Quite similar but not continuous since the weekend\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: not super helpful but i guess good that you havn;t been nauseous all week but bad that its back. I'm guessing your eating and drinking has been off while being in marlow?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: To be honest I've eaten proper food for lunch as it was catered but definitely didn't get enough water. Will be better with it tomorrow\\
How's the bug?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Still bugged. Going to eat. I have a theory that I’ll test out after food.\\
I think it’s a timings problem\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good that you have an idea to try. That's half the battle.\\
What's for dinner?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Curry from the freezer and then the last slice of cake from Sunday.\\
Have you got food sorted?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh is the cake still good?\\
Not yet, will put something together when I get back.\\And I'm too bloody early :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Everything alright?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: yep all good. Although I realise I didn't answer your question. Cake was still good. and I have found an issue. Now the problem of fixing it.\\
How did getting touched up go?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah that's why I asked :face-with-tears-of-joy: you know how I am with them blue ticks.\\
Oh well done on finding the bug. How complicated is it to fix?\\Oh it went beautifully. She is so so wonderful. You should book yourself in :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: The problem I've found is that the code is taking too long to execute vs the time I have available. So I need to find some way to speed it up. Could be a challenge\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That does sound complicated\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: its the problem of it all be written in python. Its just a lot slower language to execute\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I trust you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I wouldn't know\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are we seeing each other tomorrow?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: We can. Not sure on dinner. Chickpea curry?\\
All depends how you are feeling as haven't you done something every evening this week?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Do you want to?\\
If not tomorrow then Sunday I guess\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Rule 2!\\
Yes I want to see you.\\We have had more than one conversation where you have said you've been pushing it too much and need to rest and relax more. So if that means you need to spend tomorrow evening pottering or doing nothing then that ok. Otherwise it would be great to see you.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sometimes it's important to say it, I don't assume things. And you seemed quieter than usual\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The quietness is only due to me trying to get this robot ready and I was pretty unavailable yesterday. <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :clapping-hands::flexed-biceps::loudly-crying-face:\\
Well done. It is good fun\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I don't know. Got to get all the gear now\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: plenty of time to sort all of that\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did you fix the bug\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: nope and one of the "fixes" I put in has made it slower :loudly-crying-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Always gets worse before it gets better. Maybe a fresh brain will help?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I hope so. WIll give it another half hour\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm just pottering to bed\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: late for you? Bit of a lie in tomorrow?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah it took me ages to unwind after food. I'm going to try\\
Spin tomorrow?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: thought for a second you were going to join me at spin then. Yeah going to do spin again. See what its like with the new guy again.\\
I'll wish you good night then. x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\Hope you sleep well and feel much less meh in the morning\\Love YOu :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, no I don't fancy throwing up.\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not to be too dramatic but spin was cancelled as I sat on the bike and it’s ruined the whole day :loudly-crying-face:\\
:rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\Seems like the new guy has some family problem that isn’t going away so they said they might have to drop the Thursday class AND Tam is going on Holiday for a few weeks in a few weeks. Nightmare.\\I had a feeling I should have had a lie in and I didn’t take my gym kit either.\\Time for some house jobs I guess. <This message was edited>\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x\\
I woke up super early and then went back to sleep and just woke up. Unintentional lay in.\\That is so rubbish. Sorry you've had such a bummer of a start.\\Summers are always a bit shit for classes, everyone is everywhere.\\What house jobs do you have on the list?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That good for the lay in. You do seem better at napping than sleeping recently. How do you feel this morning?\\
It happens a fair amount. Was just excited to get 3 spin classes this week. Maybe I need to look again at becoming a spin instructor.\\Got a load of washing on, need to put some washing away, dishwasher is running. Really need to mop but that’s a next week thing now.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I don't know why I'm not sleeping properly\\
I think it's probably because I'm finally not in acute stress constantly and my body doesn't know what to do.\\It might be something to look into over the summer?\\That sounds like a productive day. Why mop next week?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Next week because I don’t want to do it today :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Are you still taking your night time drugs at the same time?\\
Just a thought if drug timing has changed making sleep different. It’s odd because you have consistently slept better while on these drugs (I think) and you always slept very well if we had sex.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes I've been taking my meds at the same time. Yes, I have had some good sleep for a while, just these last two- three weeks have been so rubbish\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What time later?\\
Shall I get some popadoms and naan bread?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm hating to admit it but you might have been right yesterday :face-with-rolling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00019409-GIF-2024-06-20-10-00-28.mp4>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m annoying like that\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't laugh at me :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I might need a night at home :face-with-rolling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s not at you per se. It’s that you said I was right. I always find that funny. Mainly because it would happen a lot at work. Which is funny because the client was paying for me to be right and still suprised that I was right.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Really :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: after being super busy all week and being busy tomorrow.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But I also miss your face\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s completely ok. The extra time certainly won’t hurt my robot endeavours.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I miss your face as well.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I was just thinking - where are you off to on Fri?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup that's the face\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: One of my better pictures :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Off to Marlow on Friday for Chris’s house.\\
At some point in the afternoon I’ll lose the will to live at Metro bank as we get a company bank account\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yes, I knew it was someone local. Sorry brain fog\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Your in London tomorrow?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: We can see each other Sunday. Although I will have forgot to tell you there is an F1 race. I think it’s at 3pm so might time nicely with you wanting a nap.\\
Have you had any luck with IKEA?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes for Mechtild's retirement dinner\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Definitely Sunday. I'm just trying to talk to someone. Haven't had a chance before\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: good luck\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Refund and £10 voucher\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: no new cabinet?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They offered but it will just arrive damaged\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: quite likely\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: \url{https://www.amazon.co.uk/Abyssaly-Self-Adhesive-Wallpaper-Decorative-Countertops/dp/B0855GC784}\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I can find a nice vinyl wrap for the top of the least damaged... At least it's free I guess\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: yeah, at least it is free. That's much better\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i'd had the thought if you got a wrap that is wider than the top then we could cover the whole thing. Top and front edge. Would look more seemless as well\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh absolutely, that's the plan :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00019438-GIF-2024-06-20-14-26-12.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Had a lunch nap\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: well done\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your day been?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: it was going ok until lunch and now nothing works and I currently have zero idea what or why\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh nooooo. Step away and get some fresh air?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That's when I had lunch :loudly-crying-face:. I think I've done something to the board. Something isn't happy and I really cannot why the code would be doing it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh bugger. Would retracing your steps be any help?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That what I am currently trying. Very slow and very frustrating as an hour before lunch I thought I had it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know! But you can do it!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: maybe. I'm going to be very something if I go on Saturday with nothing\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You have today and part of tomorrow?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I might be back to a somewhat ok point\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have today but don't really have tomorrow. I would have had the afternoon but got to get bank account sorted\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Woo hoo. I knew it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: now I just need to go back to fixing the problem I had this morning. I do really writing code but sometimes it does make you want to jump off a bridge\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I remember having that feeling just doing the basics so can imagine the frustration\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: its not so bad if your working through something but when it was almost working and then something unexpected breaks. It very annoying.\\
Are you nearly done for the day?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Another half hour and then yes. Debating going for a walk\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Could be good to move about a little\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's what I'm thinking\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I did a little half hour. It's warm\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, its proper toasty outside. Going to get warmer as well.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: well done on the walk\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Swimming on Monday?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I might go Sunday morning too but it might be too early for you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i'll go with you. I'm likely to be ruined from Spin and Hannah but I like being by the lake\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh of course.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's the fixing?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: ok ish\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: My master plan has failed horribly. I had found a way to overclock the processor. Which does sort of solve the problem because it all gets run faster but it creates more problems than it solves. SO, I have just slowed everything down\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have found I could get a processor board that is 4x faster but goes against part of what i'm trying to do and overall there is a bit of an issue with the grand vision of making a robot work with a pi RP2040 processor.\\
I am fundamentally missing something on how to multi thread the application. Too late to ask questions now or rework anything but its a direction to go in after the weekend\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That sounds really complicated and you are clever clogs for even knowing what's going on.\\
Will it work on Saturday?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is the question. I think it will do something. Work is a whole other thing. I'm thinking it might limp round\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Still better than nothing?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yes, better than nothing\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I've really got to do better than a Did not start or Did not finish\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It will work somehow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Quick question - did I only give you the pineapple cheese on Sunday?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And some cheddar\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s I’m guessing you’re hinting for?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hunting\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well that's why I just found the goats cheese I bought you :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And not the cheddar I bought myself :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That does make more sense\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Soz\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You deleted this message.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Np\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh what did you delete? :eyes:\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00019519-GIF-2024-06-21-15-44-45.mp4>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just got back from sorting the bank account. Nearly 2 hours it takes :man-facepalming:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hope you have a nice time in town.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes. Don't know which train I'll make\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s always the other one\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Is it all sorted?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, online access already and cards printed. Would have been even longer if I didn’t already have a customer profile from the art group account\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah well done!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you eating with Chris or do you need to fit it before?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: We are doing a BBQ at Chris’s. So hopefully a relatively calm evening.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah nice!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am going to and from London on the night of Taylor swift wembley gig :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone::woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The train isn’t stopping at Wembley though. Saw some complaints on Facebook about it. You seem to get good timings with some of your London trips.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh they are today, just not tomorrow :loudly-crying-face:\\
Honestly, like I'm being punished :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You’ll have to make it back in before all the swifties get released\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Really hoping to!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you off at 5.30?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Trying to be there for 5:30\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So leaving in 20 mins or so\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Cab?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Driving. Not drinking\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ooooh\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Because of tomorrow?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And party because I’m not sure I could be bothered anyway to spend £40 on cabs\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That is absolutely fair enough. If I were home I'd drop you off\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope you have a good time tonight.\\
Can't wait to give you a squeeze. Love ya\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Me to, although I was hoping for a bit more than just a squeeze :face-blowing-a-kiss:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well that as well\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm having a bit of a vulnerable week so I'm just going to ask instead of thinking about it all night and tomorrow.\\
Which part of my message was the me too for?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was for the squeeze bit but both really.\\
At the moment I’m really not all that bothered about going out. So hopefully it will be good. Another reason to drive.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How about the third thing?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What third thing?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: About the drop off? I wasn’t responding to that at all.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No! The love ya\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s what the heart emoji was for.\\
First time using the love ya sign off\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah okay\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Drive safe. Have fun!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just waiting for the train home. How's your evening been?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Late night for you. Will you miss Taylor swift people.\\
Just about getting ready to go home. It’s been ok. Chris is an idiot but been really nice seeing Ben again.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup, I missed the Swifties but this is literally the slowest train in the world. I'll have a little lay in tomorrow.\\
I'm glad you had a somehow nice time. Why is Chris an idiot?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh no is it the train that stops everywhere. It’s soo slow.\\
I’m back home now.\\I can fill you in on Sunday but the man cannot organise anything. He invited us and the lack of preparation was embarrassing. Worst is that he has got back with his ex girlfriend who he keeps saying is mental and he should leave :man-facepalming:\\Such a muppet\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you have a nice time?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Literally everywhere but at least we missed the wembley rush. The next train was going to be even slower and would hit the gig leavers.\\
Just got home too. A bit shattered :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\Oh I can't wait to hear all about it!\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Love a good bonfire but I always stick for days even with showers\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, it was so so nice seeing everyone. The food was absolutely gorgeous but sooo pricey\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m glad you had a good time.\\
At least tomorrow you can nap a bit. I think.\\I’m almost afraid to ask how much food was. Probably £50-£60 would be my guess\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup, it was a set menu because we were a bigger group. I mean it was a Michelin guide restaurant and absolutely gorgeous but ouch\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah that’s ouch. Glad it was good though.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: She only retires once\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: In theory :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
You hear about people retiring, getting bored and going straight back to work.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha yeah. But I think she's very much ready and her husband's been pestering her for a few years now\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hope it works out for her then.\\
Are you pottering or going to bed.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Pottering towards the bed :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't rest your eyes on the sofa!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, not been drinking so I think I’m ok.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Will be heading up in a bit\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: \url{https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGegxBcku/}\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you still getting up at 7?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: They are good question. Well interesting and a little akward but good.\\
Alarm is set for 6:15\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You can answer them on Sunday :winking-face:\\
Ooouf that's early\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep, same time as this morning. Sundays and Wednesdays are my normal lie in days\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
Hopefully I get a lay in tomorrow and then can go swimming on Sunday\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hopefully or you can have a nap in the morning.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m just going up to bed so will wish you good night x x x x x x x x x\\
Hope you get to actually sleep tonight.\\I love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night x x x x x x x sleep well\\

Enjoy the pottering and Katie’s thing.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have fun today :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: hope the manly mouse works\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your day been?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Been really good. Slight mental overload. Think I’m having food here before going home. Deciding now\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I'm glad you're having a good time. How did the mouse do?\\
Which Stratford are you in?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Upon Avon.\\
Didn’t get to the middle but the mouse did as good as I would have liked. A stupidly hard maze and not many people made it.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: How was \/ is Katie’s thing?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's good! Well done\\
Katie's thingy is good. Very chilled, it's super sunny and lovely. Won't be much longer\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I should be making my way home soon. What are your thoughts for timings tomorrow?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did you have dinner?\\
I'm going to go swimming in the morning and then I was thinking I could pick up breakfast and head to you?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah just trying to pay.\\
That works, I thought I was coming to yours\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We can go to mine after?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: We can do that.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Drive safe. Let me know when you're back :red-heart:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just about to drive home.  What time ish tomorrow. Just so I know when to set my alarm. In case your asleep before I get home\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 9ish? I'm going to the lake for 8\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Maybe 9.30\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just made it home.\\
9:30 works :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that didn't take too long! I bet you are shattered\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I caught some serious sun :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I flew back. I am absolutely ruined. Legs hurt but that is probably yesterday mixed with standing all day. Brain is mush and mild headache. Really good day though.\\
Oh dear, was sun cream not used?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Can you take a bath?\\
I can't wait to hear all about it tomorrow :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\I did, but I didn't reapply because it started off as super cloudy :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I could but it a bit warm for that. Will get some drinks and zone out in front of the tv for a bit. Currently watering the garden because I’m old\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You are not old! Garden needs watering!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have managed to get some grass growing where there was dirt\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yay, well done! You see all the watering works\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Definitely needs the water. It’s not gone as well as id like and thing I’ll have to have another go but need this stuff to grow a bit more first.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah it always needs couple reseeds when you have patches\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ouch. That looks bad.\\
Do you have cream\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Bath in it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Already third lot on straight from the fridge\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That bad?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It was so deceiving with the stupid cloud\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Never trust the cloud\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I never burn\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Fuuuuuuck\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Your photo says otherwise\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Plus your bright white\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Stupid stupid\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly. This year I didn't get a baseline\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Need to go tits out in your garden :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Another reason why I don’t like outside. The sun hurts you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That will hurt the most. Burnt tits\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I love the sun! You know that\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I won't burn them\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The sun was nice today but very warm\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I was up early so just went.\\
I'm going to go home and shower and then come to you?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's alright. Red as anything but doesn't hurt\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sounds like a good plan. I can just comes to yours if that’s easier?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good that the burn isn’t hurting\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: With breakfast?\\
We can do that\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Me bring breakfast? Yeah. I assume when you said breakfast you meant McDonalds\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah, yes\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Give me an hour?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also my flat is a mess, I was planning on tidying this afternoon\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok.\\
Sausage and egg muffin. 2 hash brown and coffee?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You can tidy while the F1 is on and we are going to make more mess anyway\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just checking as I thought one of the goals was to build more ikea <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes yes\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m sure all the McDonalds coffee tastes the same and I would have done flat white but what coffee would you like?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Latte please\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just leaving the house now\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yay!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: In my rush this morning to put my washing on. I did everything BUT put the washing in the machine :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::man-facepalming:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh nooooo :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Well it still has loads of time to get done\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you for today :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Omg :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone::woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone::woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone::woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
I'm pretty sure not that long\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: in fairness I didn’t see the 2023 until I was taking the picture\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sorry!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s not a problem. I just thought it was funny.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I honestly didn't think I'd had them longer than since like December\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: December 2022.\\
I did a bit of a cull in my kitchen the other day and had a worrying amount of out of date stuff I thought was fine.\\Just about to tackle some gardening\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was vroom vroom?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was pretty good. I might have had a 10 lap nap by mistake.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's the garden looking?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Looks green.\\
It’s been attacked. I sweated like I was in a spin class. The new grass looks good but need to do more. Plenty for us to cut up next weekend.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I made dinner and it got so hot here :hot-face:\\
Well done on the garden . What are you up to tonight?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah it’s super warm now.\\
Not really sure.  It hungry yet so might try a bit of robot stuff and measure some windows to order the tints. See if I can keep the house cool.\\Have you found out if your home or office tomorrow?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll WFH tomorrow, all my meetings are online and no one will be in the office\\
I made the greek Mac and cheese, so yum\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: that's good at least. A more relaxed start to the week\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah it will definitely be busy this week with Amanda not being here\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: its normally much less work when the boss isn't around\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nah because I'm covering all the work\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What do I do with my old Xbox?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Erm, I have no idea. Factory reset some how and charity shop?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: its an old 360 right\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup 360 and the motion thingy\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: or sell on ebay \/ vinted\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I haven't switched it on since I moved out of my old place almost 5 years ago :grimacing-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: probably worth seeing if it powers up. Then if it works you can get rid\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll do that.\\
Have you had dinner yet?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: not yet, going to hunt for some now\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: A late one for you!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: yeah it because I ate during the race\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah of course. Were the snacks snacky?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also, my phone is buggered. Just spent the last half hour trying to reset it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The snacks snacked well.\\
Oh no. Buggered how?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just wouldn't turn on, was stuck on loading screen no matter what, wouldn't even reset\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Very strange. Sorted now?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you talk about needing a new phone a while ago?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: For now I guess\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s something at least\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I did but I still have almost a year on the contract :face-with-rolling-eyes:\\
Next one is definitely going to be SIM only\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s what I’ve done. It hurts but definitely is cheaper overall\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah when the time comes I'll do that. Just hopefully this will hold out\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have made it to bed. I’ll wish you good night x x x x x x x x x\\
Really enjoyed seeing you today :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\Hope you sleep well.\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm just about to go too.\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x\\
It is really warm. Even the cat didn't sleep with me I was tossing and turning so much.\\Oh big morning for you! Make sure you rest after\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, there will be resting. No worries about that.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Do they make a cold weighted blanket?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha good. What's the plan for the day?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think they make a cooling one\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not sure on the full plan yet. Maybe some robot stuff while it fresh. Maybe some house stuff or a combination.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Any of those is a good plan. You can do whatever you want which is the good thing :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Infinite choice is sometimes a bad thing. Think it will be robot and window tinting today.\\
Absolutely knackered now. Great spin and session.\\Was thinking Wednesday lake? Friday something. Along with Saturday and Sunday things.\\I want to do park run this week but not sure if Wycombe or black park.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Robot and windows is a good plan. Don't over do it.\\
I'm at the prom on Friday but otherwise all else works. May be rescheduling Saturday with Bev too.\\I'm going to go for a swim after work today - do you want to come with?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: At the lake?\\
Also off to see parents in a little bit so that’s going to eat the day.\\So just us Saturday?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, at the lake. Will be leaving 5ish I think.\\
Say hello to parents for me :smiling-face:\\Not sure yet but 80\% yes\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Can I decide on the lake after lunch? I could pick you up and save 2 cars.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes of course you can.\\
I was going to pick you up :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, either or.\\
Will let you know once I get back from Mums\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okie doke. Give Eva a cuddle for me please\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Back home now. With a ridiculous headache for some reason.\\
I could pick you up at 5 if you like for the lake?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no! Have you had enough water?\\
How are the parents?\\That would be great. Thank you :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I thought I had but maybe not enough soon enough. Will be drinking everything for the rest of the afternoon.\\
Parents are ok. Not going away now for a combination of reasons. Dad is super stressed. I think he thinks something will be different when Nan goes into a home. Hopefully it makes something different in his mind but in reality it won’t make any difference other than a slightly nicer environment.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's really warm. We all probably need more than we think.\\
It's normal that he's stressed, it is a stressful situation over all. I hope her being in a home will give him some peace of mind\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: On the way\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yay!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Absolutely demolished that Mac and cheese. Have you had dinner yet?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just about to hunt for pudding.\\
Well done\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I had an ice lolly :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm in bed. Took the duvet off and replaced it with just a sheet, it's so warm.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done. Is super humid. Need a cold mat or a bigger fan.\\

It's so so warm.\\Tossed and turned again, I guess that's the norm now.\\Did you sleep well?\\Hope spin is good!\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m not sure it time to just accept forever that you sleep poorly. Tonight and tomorrow will probably be bad but after that there isn’t great reason why your shouldn’t be sleeping.\\
Slept ok. Hot and I switched to a sheet.\\Spin is so mentally painful. Needs more people and just more energy. He is covering Thursdays class :face-vomiting::face-vomiting::face-vomiting: so not sure if I’ll go to that.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm not going to accept it just yet but would love a good night's sleep .\\
How's the raptor? Have you been on a walk yet?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: She's so gangly :smiling-face-with-hearts::smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Very\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You could get her a wet towel. And one for you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good idea, I could just hit her with the hose if needed. Its currently trying to sleep :crossed-fingers:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hose would be a fun game. Does she like water?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: She likes the stream. Not sure if she likes the hose. The house is still cool. I’m sure if I watered the garden I’d end up watering the dog :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
She loves being attacked with a towel\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They sometimes get a little shock from the hose when they are really hot don't they?\\
What's the plan for today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: They can be odd with the hose.\\
Not sure really. Will all depend what puppy is like. We are currently watching end of watch.\\While she’s quiet I’ll stay sitting.\\How’s your day going in the office?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Enjoy the quiet :smiling-face:\\
Day is busy. Already on 6k steps. Steph will destroy me tonight\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Blimey. That a lot of walking for corporate.\\

I might come for the hose down <This message was edited>\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, it’s really starting to warm up now. We are still hiding in the living room with the curtains drawn.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m not sure I should have taken the the more powerful hayfever tablet this morning. It’s seem to be kicking my ass now.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no\\
What's happening?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just getting very tired. Despite the packet saying it doesn’t cause drowsiness\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Do you want to try mine? They are really good\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 13.2k steps kill me\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ve got some non drowsy stuff but was doubling down. Will just take it at night.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Wow, you’ll be dead dead after Steph then\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm dead dead now\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah. Did you have a good day?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm just leaving work\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The last hour was a struggle but she is cute. 4 hours would be better as literally have done nothing so far today.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What’s the plan before Steph?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I can imagine. Puppies are the hardest aren't they?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not much. I have like 25-30mins\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, I had it in my head it was 7:30 or maybe that was the morning time she suggested\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah she suggested 745 for yesterday.\\
What's your plan for tonight?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Think i'm going to try and do some robot stuff. Its not mega hot in my office. Will just see if I can get anything done\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: enjoy your session\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
Are you going to the ypom thing?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I had completely forgotten about that. I'd like to see everyone as not seen many from the group for a while just not sure I want to sit outside in the heat. Where you thinking of going?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly I don't think I'll be able to. I just need to eat and have a bath\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good plan. I think i'll miss it. Not sure who is going and its too warm\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah me too. I had a cold shower. And I'm bitten all over from yesterday :face-screaming-in-fear:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: how did you get bitten in the water or was it after?\\

I would suggest going to the lake to sit but I think it’s uncomfortably warm\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Dinner and chill might be nice :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Let’s do that then :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
Let me know a time\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Shall we say I'd be with you 6ish?\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: Brilliant :star-struck:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What?\\

Hope it all goes well with dad and nan today :red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: August 10th Saturday for dinnner?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no I just booked that with Bev this morning\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Done and booked\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How’s the day going. Still up and not crying?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: They are discharging Nan today so the day has been turned around. Currently all hurry up and wait :man-facepalming:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not crying!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oooooh wow. So what's happening? Is she going straight to the home?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: But not up?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I primarily up\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Going to the home at some point today. Maybe 2 maybe 3 maybe after her meds are sorted maybe 4 :man-facepalming::man-facepalming::man-facepalming:\\
In cannot make it fashion it would actually be better tomorrow because her new teeth are also arriving today but the is just no chance of them making it to the discharge lounge before she goes. So that adds more faff\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah, that happened all so fast. How are you and dad doing?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m bored and annoyed at the lack of efficiency. Dad is just trying to juggle stuff but seems pretty good.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I can imagine you are but you can't do much about it. NHS is struggling.\\
Glad he seems good. Are you going to have some lunch?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ve managed to hunt a mildly ok sandwich from the cafe. Cost half the house :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh.... Yum I guess :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you survived the day?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Nice,\\
She has made it to the home. So that’s progress.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's good! How's mum and dad?\\
Are you home yet?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: They seem ok. I’m not sure dad is home yet.\\
Yeah I’ve been home for a bit. Just about to head out to my nerd group.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You home?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I just stopped for some food at Aldi. Absolutely starving.\\
It's been a big day for you - how are you doing?\\Hope nerdy group is good :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m doing ok. A while bit day of nothing without much resolution at the end and didn’t even get the jobs done that my dad wanted so that will all have to happen next week.\\
This whole thing is just going to drag on.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It was never going to be a quick process unfortunately . But I'm sure even if he doesn't say it, your dad really appreciated you being there for them.\\
Now go and have a fun evening\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think he did like me being there. Was at least someone to talk to.\\
Are you all set for prom tomorrow?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I haven't even thought about it yet :face-with-tears-of-joy: tomorrow's issue.\\
I'm just in bed. How was\/is nerdy group?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good plan.\\
You’ll have to think fast on the dress then.\\It’s been ok. Few good chats. Bit quiet now. Good to come I just wanted more stuff done first.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's good that you've gone. You can do stuff tomorrow.\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: I wasn’t back super late but it was by the time I’d pottered :man-facepalming: and decompressed enough to go to sleep.\\
Got Hannah at 7:30 today. Not sure what we will be doing. Maybe deadlifts but we did sumos last week so it could be a mixed session.\\Enjoy the walk.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You didn't text me :pensive-face:\\
I'm sure it will be a good (warm) session :smiling-face:\\Any other plans for today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That I got home? Sorry, I just knew you were already asleep.\\
I’ve got my hospital thing this morning. Then talking to my friend Chris.\\Today it should be too hot and I’ll actually have a chance to re do the sensors on my robot. Then I can start working on some code. That’s the plan anyway.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah of course. What time is it?\\
Hope Chris and fam are feeling better now.\\Sounds like a good productive day x\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: 9:50. They give a very specific time which I find strange.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Probably because they are very short apts.y flu jab was at 8.27 :woman-shrugging-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was more than I would have expected a window of time to drop off rather than an actual time. Done now.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well done. When are you going to hear back?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: 3 weeks\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Even though they will have finished the test within the next hour\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that's bizarre\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Definitely could be less than 3 weeks\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: They do the test, write it up. Send it to the guys who’s in charge of the vasectomies in Maidenhead. They review and then send out the results.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thoughts and plans for tomorrow? Mainly timings and dinner.\\
I’m going to do the black park parkrun. Probably home 11ish then need to shower and lunch.\\Did you still want to do gardening? Could do steak for dinner?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Can attach the front the garden and if I have the energy Rip up some plants I don’t like in the back.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh okay. Are you going alone?\\
I think I'm going to jeff Wycombe.\\Yes to both questions :smiling-face: I was actually thinking about steak too\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Going with Cally because she can’t run on tarmac yet. Will be doing Wycombe next week.\\
Ok sounds good. I’ll go to Lidl once I get back from parkrun.\\I guess you’ll have a nap after running?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, I'll definitely need a nap ( just woke up from today's), especially if I'll be late back tonight. How's robot going?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I've printed out a new set of sensor blocks so just about to fit them. Just had a little look to see about holidays from heathrow. About to send over\\

Yeah I'm just going to slowly do all the bits\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not particularly rested no. No doubt I’ll get a little nap while the racing is on.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I wonder why that is\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :man-shrugging: probably because of having a lie in. Never mind.\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: Some sort of tidying, washing, food, bit of robot before the race than not sure after the race. Either more robot, garden or games but I might be gardened out\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sounds like you've had a nice productive morning :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
I did the kitchen and had a nap, went into town, popped into Sainsbury's and now just home. Will have lunch and do the bathroom and hoover\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Enjoy, race is just about to start. So I might be having my own nap :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm bored now :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just leaving\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: See you in a bit. I have no idea where the pub is :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am washed and smelling lovely :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
How was dinner?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done.\\
Dinner was ok. Nothing special.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What did you have?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Some chicken nuggets and a bit of cheese.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I had a protein yoghurt with a banana\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm glad I got to see you today. Sorry about my smokey hair\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s pudding not dinner\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: Omg! That’s what Eva does\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Can we take her for a walk sometime?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Probably. Lexie would be better as Eva has a habit of running off\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Either :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'd love to go on a dog walk with you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I always have to remember that a dog walk and a walk are separate things\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah. Yeah\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
Yeah I was up in the middle of the night again.\\Did you sleep well?\\Hope you have a good sesh. What time is Hannah?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Think I slept ok. Just not super long.\\
I’ve got Hannah at 8:15. So going straight from spin.\\Hope your day in the office goes well.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Big morning again for you.\\
Hope the sessions are good!\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: TWO there were TWO of us until Maria (manager) managed to scrounge a third. OMG it was shit.\\
There was 14 last week :man-facepalming:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Omg :hushed-face: what? That must have been the lowest number!\\
Go smash the session with Hannah\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Saturday. Assuming we are having dinner I was thinking of cooking a shepards pie. The recipe says to use wine. Is that 100\% ok with you or should I just take it out?\\
Then that does dinner for both of us and should give me 2 more dinners for Sunday and Monday.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: More thoughts.\\
I’m not feeling the lake today. My legs are absolutely knackered not that I’d swim anyway. So didn’t know if you just wanted to drop in on your way home to say hello?\\As for the rest of the week I’m not sure if your thoughts.\\Friday is Mikes 40th thing. Address I will get.\\I’m out Wednesday evening (Duncan). Thursday evening I have a robot group call but that isn’t until 8pm.\\Tuesday I want to do the track session.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That sounds good, haven't had Shepard's pie in years. The wine will be okay, it should cook off anyway\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm not feeling the lake much either, it's quite cold. But if Agi goes I might too because I promised her. I'll see what's happening and could pop in to say hello.\\
I've got bookclub on Tuesday, facial on Wednesday and walk after work with Becky on Thursday but that shouldn't be more than hour ish so could pop by before robot call\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: All sounds good. I wondered if that might be the issue with my Chinese beef as that has a bit of sherry in it. I guess we will find out on Saturday.\\
So I might see you later and similar on Thursday and then we are out Friday.\\Saturday something. Could do more gardening if you like or we could build Ikea \/ something at your place.\\Your out out Sunday?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I didn't realise it was in there. Maybe? I guess we'll see.\\
Yes, I'll be in London on Sunday. Already tired :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\How was Hannah? And how's your morning been?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: And you don’t have an evening to yourself again?\\
Hannah was good. Broke me but I’m also getting stronger :flexed-biceps: which is always good.\\Shopping arrived and I’ve got the beef in the slow cooker. Just showered. Now lunch. Then I can start the day :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well technically tonight and then Wednesday is a pamper. But yea terrible planning on my part.\\
Well done on the session!\\Sounds like a great morning :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: what is the plan for later? Robot?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah all robot. Seeing if I can get something new to show Duncan on Wednesday.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good luck with the robot. My day is mental\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thanks.\\
Keeping going. One thing at a time and its almost over\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00020060-GIF-2024-07-01-15-22-25.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll have to stay a bit later today\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Early finish Friday :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Definitely\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: future goal. Same money and not working fridays\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, that's what Amanda does\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: its better than a pay rise\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: \url{https://maps.app.goo.gl/7FVbSfnSNqfx9DZk9}\\
Friday\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: From 6pm is the arrival\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am pooped\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :crying-face: all done though?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not yet\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00020072-GIF-2024-07-01-17-04-13.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hungry\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How do you see future? :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm just going to drive straight to you for a quick hello. Is that okay?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: yeah that's ok. What time?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Going to leave in 10 max\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: ok\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've picked up my meds :party-popper::party-popper::party-popper:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: WOOOOO well done\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: \# proud\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you for the cuddle\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Your welcome. Hoped it helped you decompress a bit\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Massively. Sorry if I just word vommed the moment I sat down :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s ok\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's the beef?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also!!! We still haven't done a date just for you!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not tried it yet. Rice is still cooking.\\
Oh yeah. You remember that but not drugs :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:. Will sort something but I guess might be August\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I want to do nice things for you! You're still not telling me things that would make you feel loved\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know. I like it when you help me with stuff and I’d like us to play more games\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We can do that. We can play some games on Saturday?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah we can give it a go\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't be so excited :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your evening been?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I'm excited. Just on the phone to my friend Giles\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope they're all good!\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x\\
You're up early :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\I'm glad you had a nice catch-up with Giles.\\What are you up to today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll be getting the raptor in less than an hour. Will take her for a walk, maybe the wood again.\\
Then getting to my parents for 10:30 so I can go help dad with stuff at Nans house. Basically the plan from last Thursday.\\Hopefully it doesn’t take forever but we will see.\\Then will do my run later. Not sure anyone from the group is joining.\\You’ve got book club later?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I need some raptor cuddles soon!\\
Hopefully it all goes well at Nan's house.\\Yup bookclub later. Just hoping I can get through the necessary work stuff in relative peace\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just had my overnight oats. I’m not sure on chia seeds\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ooh what did you have in there?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Coconut yogurt, oats, chia seeds, protein powder and almond milk.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I used to put a little bit of apple juice at the bottom too.\\
I have chia seeds in the porridge but I guess they don't sit all night expanding\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Awwwwwwwwwww\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: She's so long and lanky :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: love it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Big project for behind your sofa?\\
\url{https://youtu.be/ExQtSJ2baho?si=gEQYfxQtM4ckuWyt}\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Parts of it could work. But I really just want a breakfast bar with comfy stools and yarn storage :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh wow!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's it going?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s going.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That sounds ominous\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just a lot of faff. Dad had 2 calls while we were loading the trailer. Dead rat in the pond. Back at mum and dads now.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh fun. Did you get loads done?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I don’t know about loads but got stuff done. Just all takes forever\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It will. It's a house full of decades of life\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you home now?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Home now. Dad just left. Just me and the dog now. Time for a bit of sitting.\\
How’s your day going?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's been alright. Loads of stuff to do but nothing horrendous\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Woo hoooo :partying-face::partying-face::partying-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh wow. You have the chimenea. S'mores on Saturday?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: We can give it a try. Not sure I know what they are but we can try\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Toasted marshmallows in between a cracker and square of choc\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You're not running tonight?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No Toria bailed and no one else signed up. Right knee is a bit funny but that could just be an excuse\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah boo. Sorry it didn't work out\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh thank you. How much was it?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Will try again next week.\\
No idea yet. Will find out.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Please let me know.\\
So what are you getting up to with the change in plans?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Put down some bark clippings out the front. Had a bit of a play with some chlorine to see what it does to the patio.\\
Will be able to fix my resin printer and reprint some stuff I want for tomorrow.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's a very productive afternoon\/evening :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
Are you okay?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah I’m ok.  Nothing I can do it about. This is a thing our family is crap at. Talking about emotional stuff. Money, not much of a problem. Emotional stuff impossible.\\
I realised earlier that I think part of my dad’s problem is that he isn’t getting any positive feedback. Everything he is dealing with is just all problems to sort with no good outcome.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Where have you got to go for book club?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know not much can be done but you can still feel a way about it. And it's all valid. Wish I could do more to help.\\
Maybe you could give your dad some positive feedback. Just tell him something along the lines of he's doing a good job sorting stuff?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: All the way to my couch :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have a safe trip :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Yeah, I’ll say something.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Can I help with something? Or make you feel better somehow?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thanks but I don’t think there is anything.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okay.\\
But please keep telling me stuff that's on your mind. We talk about emotions :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\I do notice when you're quieter than usual\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I will and I do try to.\\
How was book club?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's still going. How's your evening?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s a lot of book talking.\\
Evenings ok. Now playing a couple of games. Got the resin printer back up and running.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well, there was very little book talking :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Oh well done on fixing the printer.\\How are the games going?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Matt plays hours and hours of this game and he cannot win a one on one gun fight. I do not understand\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: going that well eh?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: We won the first game and then it just been meh. I just don’t understand how he isn’t getting better.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Late night for you.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
What's the deal with the job?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It is. And a massive day tomorrow. Just got into bed\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night x x x x x x x x x x\\
Hope you sleep well.\\I love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: He has a job and paper work apparently. I think it is going to be a huge shock to his system. We will see.\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x\\
You had a nice lay in :smiling-face: did you sleep well?\\I've got that massive event on today :grimacing-face:\\Enjoy the bike.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Slept ok at best. Lots of tossing and turning.\\
Good luck. You’ll smash it.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you.\\
What are you up to today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: As I’m seeing Duncan later I’ve got to see if I can the robot working again or at least to a point were he might be able to help.\\
Going to put more food in the slow cooker as well.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sounds great!\\
Hope the robot gets working!\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Love you :red-heart:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :red-heart:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What's the pic?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: A box of organised electronic components\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did it fall?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Is it sarcasm?\\
I'm not getting it\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: well it was organised and is organised again. I just picked up the box without the lid being locked shut and the whole thing went everywhere (the pic). Just a silly mistake on my part but the second of the day so far\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aaaaah! Hate when that happens.\\
What was the first thing?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Pouring cold water in my coffee because I forgot to actually turn the kettle on.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah yes\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And apart from this, how's your day?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Going ok. The time is just flying. Just about to have lunch.\\
I’m guessing you’re having a high mental load day?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, my brain is all mush :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's the robot going?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It isn’t yet. The sensor mounts are a massive time sink but hopefully will have something in the next couple of hours.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You can do it! You are clever clogs\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thanks.\\
Just need to be more cleverer and faster :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, you'll get there\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Poopy brain.just going home. What time are you seeing Duncan?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: About 7:30. Picking up Andrea from the train station about 7:10.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: For a second I was like where am I going next week :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :face-with-rolling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't give me sass\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've got chucked baggage so I should be alright. Thank you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That's a bit easier then. I have other suitcases if needed\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've got one as well but could I have a look in case yours is smaller?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Of course. The ones in the pic are the smallest I have and I have bigger\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thanks\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Any progress with manly mouse?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: somewhat. I can now solve my office maze again. Which is good and its using the new sensor blocks. So this solves my forward calibration problem. I now get a very nice signal to distance graph which matches with what you would logically expect.\\
Even though the new sensor blocks are a very snug fit with the LED's they don't point consistently and my RAW data readings are quite different from one sensor to another.\\This is what I am hoping Duncan can help with as I am missing something to constrain.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Big science words!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But there's progress which is brilliant. Well done. And Duncan might help with the second half! Successful day\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm off for my facial\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: This is also the bit that Duncan is brilliant at. So fingers crossed. Then tomorrow I can hopefully sort it.\\
Enjoy.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah hopefully he'll have some ideas for you.\\
Thank you :smiling-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope you had a good evening.\\
Night x\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hope you managed to relax\\
Night night x x x x x x x x\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Made it home. Got my questions answered. One of them is just the way it is, so that’s fine. Other issue needs some more design work which I’ll try tomorrow. Who knew making 2 LEDs point precisely would be so hard.\\
\section*{Thursday $04\textsuperscript{th}$}
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x\\
Did you sleep well?\\Glad you had a good evening with Duncan yesterday\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00020210-GIF-2024-07-04-08-01-20.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've had a pretty similar night.\\
Did you have a good time yesterday?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m sorry you’re still not sleeping well. Did you get a chance to relax at all.\\
I think it the wrong temperature somehow. To cold for a sheet and too hot for duvet.\\Yeah it was good. Always learn something or get an idea. It would be very easy to ignore the optics (sensors) and just try and sort everything in the software but Duncan and a few others prove that if the hardware part is as good as it can be then the rest is easy.\\You WFH today?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm not sure, I did nothing for about an hour or so :woman-shrugging-light-skin-tone:\\
Ah that's good!\\What's your plan today? When are you voting?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Think I’m going to vote after breakfast. Let the school traffic go. I need to get some orange juice for the slow cooker recipe. So will do both at once.\\
Then I need to run a few test prints to see how I can solve the problem with the mouse. While I wait for that to print I really should go in the bike.\\Have got my robot call late this evening.\\Am I seeing you later?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good plan\\
I've got a walk after work but should be finished before your call. Can pop by for a squeeze if you want?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That would be nice.\\
Another busy week for you.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. I'll let you know when I'm heading from the rye. Your call is at 8, isn't it?\\
I know. Once I'm back from France I really need to chill out with the social butterfly stuff\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah 8pm.\\
You can chill a bit next week as well.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've got hair on Monday and Steph on Tue :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, Wednesday then or maybe lake swim :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly. I need to stop booking things :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
But I would like a swim\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not stop booking things but also book in rest. Rather than hoping rest will happen\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes that's a better way around it. How's your morning been?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: it been ok. Once again its gone. Voted and got the orange juice I needed. Just about to have a couple of games while I wait for a print to finish. Then lunch.\\
How's your day going?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Trying to catch up on some admin and 4 meetings :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: going to have a little snack and a little nap. Shattered today.\\
Oh btw I popped to Lidl yesterday and got you some Spanish meat sticks :smiling-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: OH meat sticks :red-heart:\\
Nap is good.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Has your print finished?\\
How were the games?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just about to test the print now to see if I can then do a bigger one.\\
Games were so so. As always, Matt was shit.\\When’s is your walk?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What are you printing? Robot bits?\\
When is he starting his job?\\Just getting changed now\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: yeah, its currently unexciting robot bits.\\
I think its at the end of the month. Given that today he said he needed to "chill out" after cutting the grass @ lunch I think he is in for a shock\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha. He won't know what hit him :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No pressure but any thoughts on your eta?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Probably another half hour or so?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just leaving rye\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Home, fed the beast, now need to feed myself.\\
Enjoy the call!\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thanks,\\
Did you resist the call of Donalds?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Unfortunately I did :confused-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: oh proper adult dinner then\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well we'll see\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: cereal?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Most probably!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Go concentrate on your nerdy stuff :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: HAHA, that is funny\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: did you manage to hunt cereal or was it boiled eggs?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: call just finished\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Cheese\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :grimacing-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was it?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: it was ok, nothing special. Just a lot of admin stuff for Manchester\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You're all set?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: In theory. We have all the stuff needed for a stand. I just need a mouse that works.\\
They do think the lighting at the event last week was causing all sorts of weirdness\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh really? Didn't realise that would affect it. Why?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Somehow seems like bits of random infrared where shining through which messes up the mouse sensors.\\
The mice that failed on the day all work in their home mazes which says it had to be an environment issue and not code or hardware\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh now you explain it, it does make sense. Hopefully that won't be the case in Manchester\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: We don't imagine much natural light in the conference centre so it should be fine and all the mice run at higher frequencies than the 60,100 or 120 from lights.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Is it in like a conference centre?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It at the Manchester version of the NEC\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ooh that's big\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: yeah, it could be super busy or empty because its such a big space. They have upgraded our area to 10x18m I think or 10x8m. Its a huge space we have to fill. a bigger hall than we were at the other week\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sounds exciting though\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: it should be. I'm hoping there are some cool models people have built. There might be a lot of R2D2's around\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I dont know who any of these people are apart from Warick \url{https://megaconlive.com/manchester/guests/}\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: A lot of voice actors!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm all tucked in.\\
I'm going to see Katie in the morning :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\Hope you sleep better tonight. Night night x x x x x x x x x x x\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done. Good choice.\\

Did you sleep well?\\It's absolutely horrendous weather. Do you have Hannah this morning?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00020269-GIF-2024-07-05-08-23-39.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I didn't realise. Thought you might have forgotten about me :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Don't look. It's horrendous.\\So what's the plan for today if no Hannah?\\Starbucks walk. It's literally October outside\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: How would I forget about you. You’re the first person I message everyday within a few minutes of me getting up.\\
Will probably do the bike again. I’m talking to Chris at 11. Need to do another batch of food.\\Really hoping the printer has made what I need for the mouse so I can move on to making the software work.\\Then we have Mikes 40th thing this evening. Should be fun and you’ll finally get to meet people I’ve been talking about.\\What time do you think you’ll finish work?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: DRUGS\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Already taken them before going out :smiling-face: thank you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ve looked outside. At least I don’t need to water the lawn today :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't know.. brain\\
Oh what food are you cooking?\\Fingers crossed for printer coming through for you.\\I'm really hoping to finish at 4ish. Pick you up at 5.30?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Going to cook a slow cooker curry. Then on Sunday I need to make a chilli and that should be meals for a couple of weeks.\\
5:30 is good.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You've been proper busy with cooking this week. Well done!\\
Oki, I'm going to get on with the million things I need to do today :red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just trying out something new with the food so that I can be consistent and hopefully start dropping some weight. Only got 2 nights out this month (tonight and a night with Lester next week) so trying to be consistent and seeing what it does.\\
Need a cleaner way to make by cube potatoes as it takes ages to clean the tray after.\\Good luck with work. Just hit the list until sign off time. Don’t forget lunch and a nap.\\There is food later but I’m not sure there will be tons of food\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Been looking again at holiday's. Really need to find a reason why the following would be a no as its has 40\% discount if we book in the next week.\\
\url{https://www.britishairways.com/travel/fx/public/en-gb?eId=111083&productType=Hotel&saleOption=PAKFH&productCode=ES-V03-0000271&duration=7&depDate=14-10-24}\\Can pay a bit more to get better flight times as the first option gets us there late in the day and the cost saving means we can easily do a private transfer from the airport so we dont have to sit on a coach.\\Would need to check and pick the right room to make sure we have 2 beds but the price difference there is marginal.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: check-out is 12pm so an earlier flight probably make sense, as it would be a late home on the last day currently\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That looks good!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just thinking magaluf might be a bit busy. What do you think?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have no idea on the busyness. I dont think it will be better or worse than anywhere else. It isn't peak summer and not school holiday. The discount says to me it isn't currently booked up so might not be busy. Anywhere we pick will be a dice role on how busy it is.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I was just thinking of magaluf particularly :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But it does look good!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We should definitely have a closer look\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also guess who hasn't gotten a lunch or a nap. Have been referencing a medical paper for 2 hours :face-with-rolling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That resort is near the airport but not part of the main town so we can check but I don’t think it’s near the clubs etc.\\
we can have a proper look tomorrow. Just seems like this resort is the £800pp range for cheaper where as the actual £500pp ones looks cheap.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Rule \#1\\
Suprised reading medical stuff doesn’t force a nap :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\Try to eat something.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I would absolutely love one :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You all done for the week now?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was your day?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done.\\
I’m not really sure. Not much seems to have been done or much less than I wanted.\\I blame the postman as I’ve been waiting all day for birthday cards to arrive which haven’t and it’s thrown me all in a tizzy.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no. Cards for tonight?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Amazing :fire:\\
Yes that will work.\\Yeah card for tonight. I have solved it with the printer.\\Risking a dress in the rain then. I don’t think it will be cold\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I'll just take my leather jacket\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: We are inside and I’m sure the people will warm the room up fast enough.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's what I was thinking.\\
What are you wearing?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you had a snack at least.\\
Black jeans and a polo\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not yet :confused-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just getting something now\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What the hell is this weather\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hopefully it stops for park run\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh god yes\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: This is normally the weather we get on my brothers birthday which is the 15th\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Leaving x\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Here\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Home!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done.\\
DRUGS!!!\\Thank you for tonight. It was really great for you to finally meet people.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It was lovely meeting them :relieved-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Are you pottering or straight to bed\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Pottering to bed :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And I made it.\\
I had a lovely time tonight.\\Hope you sleep well. Night night x x x x x x x\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\See you in the morning\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done.\\
\section*{Saturday $06\textsuperscript{th}$}
Really enjoyed spending time with you out and about.\\Hope you sleep well.\\Night night x x x x x x x x\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00020318-GIF-2024-07-06-07-41-32.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x\\
I'm hurty so definitely not running today.\\I really hope it stops but it's still going to be so soggy\\How are you feeling after last night?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m feeling ok. Slept pretty good just could have done with an extra hour.\\
Sorry you’re hurting.\\Don’t forget drugs.\\Shall I bring a big umbrella for you?\\You can have a nice nap after parkrun and coffee\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Glad you're feeling good :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
I'm just having food then drugs.\\I'm okay, thanks. I've got an umbrella and a rain Mac\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Is it the umbrella you had yesterday as that was small.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll bring a better one\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha okay. Thank you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Mainly because two people don’t fit under yours :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Very true\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s sounds like it just started raining more :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I has :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Do you need any shopping as I have a Morrisons delivery coming tomorrow morning.\\
Elderflower obtained.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm all good, thank you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm just very slowly jumping in the shower so aiming for 5.45-6?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sounds good. No rush.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Don’t forget yogurt\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Packed. Leaving in 5\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Salad\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Got it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hi, here are my Santander bank account details:\\
BIC: ABBYGB2LXXX\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm home. I went through downley and half the village was going somewhere with their camping chairs and trolleys\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, I wonder what’s on.\\
Well done. Now you can potter and relax.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you so much for feeding me. It was really yum, you are a very good cook :smiling-face: and again I'm sorry I wasn't much fun tonight\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thank you. I just follow the instructions.\\
That’s ok, not your fault. Just do what you can to recover for this week.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :smiling-face-with-hearts::smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
I'm already in bed :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\What will you do tonight?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done.\\
Not sure. Currently watching a geometry video with a glass of wine.\\Normal Saturday night stuff :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha. My favourite nerd\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to say night night x x x x x x x x\\

\section*{Sunday $07\textsuperscript{th}$}
Hope you feel better in the morning and have a good time London.\\Sleep well\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00020348-GIF-2024-07-07-07-28-30.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning. x x x x x x x x x x\\
Just got to Laura's, she'll drive to Ruislip and then we'll tube it.\\Not feeling the greatest but we'll see, drugs taken.\\How did you sleep? What's your plan for today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That better than going from Wycombe.\\
Slept ok and woke up without alarm.\\I’ve got shopping arriving today.\\Will cook a chilli. F1 is on at 3.\\Probably need to do a couple of house jobs.\\Feels like a proper free day today. Not seeing anyone and no plans to interact with people.\\Hope you have fun.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that sounds like the best day (I need one :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:)\\
Enjoy it :red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yes you do :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your day going?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: NERDS!!!!! EVERYWHERE\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Literally :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: days going ok. Not done a huge amount but just about to throw a chilli together. I did find some interesting video on how I might be able to do proper multithreading on the robot. So MEGA nerd shit.\\
The mild idea that I might do something in the garden has gone now with the huge amount of rain that just fell.\\How is the con?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Enjoy your nice slow Sunday!\\
We're both doing mega nerd shit :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\It's good. But Laura's photo is not until 4.30 so I might die :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: OMG That is so long to wait for a photo. He'll be knackered by then\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did you want me to bring you something back?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I wouldn't even know what\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Any favourite nerd bits?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They literally have everything. Some really nice prints\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: My favourite sci-fi show is Red Dwarf.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What would be quite niche so you might not see anything is anything Dungeon Crawler Carl. On the off chance you see anyone in boxer shorts and a leather coat with a stuffed cat on their shoulder. That's what they are cos playing as.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know red dwarf :face-with-rolling-eyes::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
There's unfortunately no merch that I've seen :confused-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: my second message wasn't describing anything red dwarf\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yes, I'm writing before reading :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: whats the exam rule \#1 :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I haven't seen anything dungeon crawler Carl either. Very marvel\/DC\/anime and TV shows centric. A lot of star trek\/wars stuff\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I thought it would be a lot of Star Wars or Star Trek. Which I like I’m just not obsessed with it.\\
Certainly don’t buy anything for the sake of it. If you see something that would look cool in my office then go for it but don’t force it.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: For ever time your logic works :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So all the time then :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-rolling-eyes::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That and an apron is the only red dwarf stuff. And as much as I tried there's no Carl stuff\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I would be amazed if there was Carl stuff.\\
I don’t know if the youth will have even seen red dwarf. I’ve not been able to bring myself to watch the film yet through fear.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: To be honest it's all primarily like 80s 90s TV shows and films and comic books. Not much new new stuff\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I might have gotten myself some badges and prints :beaming-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: For what show?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Loads. Dr who, Buffy, supernatural, the animated marvel and DC stuff, loads\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I meant what shows have you bought stuff for or was that your answer\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well there was a cool like travel posters style and I got a mystery bundle so don't know yet. But you will love my badge\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also I got you something which I will need to drop off. I think you'll be reasonably pleased\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, that’s a brilliant badge.  Or set it to red yet then. :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Oh, intriguing.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Or should have been Not in my last message\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: haven't put it on yet\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Enjoy vroom vroom\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00020393-GIF-2024-07-07-16-00-19.mp4>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Photo done?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: On the tube back\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Are you dropping in on your way back?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes I have to super quickly deliver your goodies which I'm hoping have survived :winking-face:\\
I'll text when I'm leaving Laura's\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: ok, see you in a bit\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just getting to Laura's so will see you in 15\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: ok, Be warned. I am in cozy clothes\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am yucky after being out the house since half 7\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, I do have a pizza stone for the oven. Have you gone out again?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No! It was on FB :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have you tried a donut? <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not yet, just battling cardboard mountain then having food.\\
Did you have your teenagers dinner?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I had some pasta\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh well done. I’m not mega hungry so having nuggets and will save the pie for Monday and Tuesday\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good plan. I had a half a donut too :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just about to try them. Gone for 2 halves\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Which ones?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm already in bed. Absolutely pooped\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I knew I should have added that to my message. The jammy dodger one and the one that had chocolate on it.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You’ll have to try your best with rule \#1 this week.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I definitely do\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh let me know what you think\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Donuts are good. Soo sweet, even for me but very good.\\
I’d best wish you good night.\\Night night x x x x x x x x\\Hope you sleep well.\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I was thinking maybe I can freeze them.\\
Night night x x x x x x x x x x x x\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Could be worth a try\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00020420-GIF-2024-07-08-06-13-32.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x\\
Oh that's such a panic when it happens.\\I'm tired and hurty as expected\\Hope spin is good :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: :face-with-head-bandage: that’s no fun for you.\\
Hope the day isn’t too bad for you.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
Are you up to much today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not really sure on today. Want to get some jobs done and put away \/ tidy up stuff. Will see what I can get done.\\
Just trying to pick up your post.\\Can you just start having stuff sent to my house?\\Don’t forget to ask about holiday dates today.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you so much for the post. I have this delivered every month and never had to go pick it up so I don't know why they didn't just leave it like usual\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The Amazon box has been beaten up and I got the other package as well.\\
That depot is so stupid. £1.30 to park.\\It was more a general thing as it feels like you’re going to a post pickup point of some sort multiple times a week. Might as well save the spoons and have it sent to me.\\Did you do drugs today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Holiday\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Didn't even know there was an Amazon package.\\
I did do drugs today but likely looking I'll be working from home tomorrow and Wednesday which is good\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I asked and should be fine. Is there any way to arrive back Sunday (6 nights) or not really?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah there were 2 packages. Amazing big box is pretty heavy.\\
That’s good news about WFH. I have the puppy tomorrow…..\\Hopefully that will help you a bit.\\I can check about the flight times. It will all depend on what days they fly there.\\Ideally It just needs to be simple on what days in October you must be at work. Then we can work around that.\\I don’t want us to be going away and you be worried or annoyed that something is happening at work. The holiday is meant to be relaxing\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm heading to WFH\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I need to be at work 21st and 22nd October as bare minimum. Btw Amanda has stayed at that hotel last year or the one before and apparently it's really great\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s good about the hotel. I’ll check on the dates later when I’m in front of the computer and get what the options are.\\
Just tackled my bedroom. I hate dusting, feels like it’s on me :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\Can you get a nap now your WFH?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh well done! Don't worry, the dusting improves with frequency :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
But you're smashing it!\\How was spin?\\I'm going to try a little half hour\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: 3 of us in spin. Toria was very annoyed she woke up for it :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
A bit better than last week but only just. Time seemed to go a bit faster. Nearly 300kcals less than what a Tam workout is like. Good zone 2 training I guess.\\Hope the nap helps.\\What time is your hair?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: I bet she was pissed\\
Glad it wasn't horrendous at least. Did you also do gym?\\Hair is at 5.30\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Didn’t do the gym but I should have. My brain completely  malfunctioned about timings. Will go on Wednesday as should run tomorrow after the day with the raptor.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I just saw the vid on FB so thought you might have gone :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s a vid from a couple of sessions ago that I forgot to post.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah but still very impressive :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I was pleased with that one. Sumo’s always seem to go wrong for odd reasons so they were good.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You're definitely getting your strength back :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just checking you woke up from your nap?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I did. But it was hard\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Starting the nap or getting back up?\\
Well done for fitting it in.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Getting back up . But definitely felt better for it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your afternoon been?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Glad the nap helped. Afternoon has been ok. Late lunch as went to donate old clothes and pick up some oats from Morrisons as I forgot to order them.\\
Drilled what I hope will be drainage holes in the garden so that Mark can have his drill back tomorrow. Just sat down to get some computer stuff done.\\Where have you got to go for your hair?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh you've been so productive today, well done. How much did you donate?\\
Same place as always. Farm somewhere kinghsill way\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: if was a full bin bag of stuff that just doesn't fit anymore. Cleared out a whole shelf in the built in wardrobe\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Amazing! Well done :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That sounds perfect! Thank you so much for doing this\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I do have a valid passport\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: what about the outbound flight time. Stick with 8:10 so we would need to be at the airport for 6 or make it later and go for the 10:30 one?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am happy with the early one if you are!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: ok, i'll get it booked\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You cannot imagine how much you doing this means to me :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thank you.\\
For me it is proper scary as I dont want it to be crap for you\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh bubs. You are doing amazingly well and I appreciate it so so much. It won't be crap. And I don't want it to be crap for you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i'm pretty sure it will be good for me. It's food, drink and a pool. Not really much to go wrong. My worries are around it being too cold for you and me sleeping messing you up somehow, if the hotels beds dont already do that.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It shouldn't be too cold! :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: And the rest we'll figure out. I'm very excited\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Me too.\\
How’s the hair?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hair's good, just had a little tidy up. Should be stopping by Michaelas for some dresses but she's not picking up!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh no, how long will you wait for?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll give it another 5-10. She might have a client\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How many dresses are you short?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Definitely a Saturday one\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So the main one :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And I need some beach stuff for Sunday but I'll pop to Matalan after work on Wednesday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Do you not have any at all or you just don’t like your options?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I have an option for Friday but nothing weddingy enough for Saturday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Don’t you have your cooking oil tan spray from the other day?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Like a beach cover up etc :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No idea what that is.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thing that goes over a bikini\\
Good idea to check whether I have a bikini\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You must have something. What were you wearing swimming last year?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: To the lake?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just in general\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That is not pool attire\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Lake, river, pool\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Pool party vibes are different to my booties and a dry robe :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’d probably just take my tri suite :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh god :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Do you need to get holiday stuff?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Probably. Maybe another pair of shorts. Maybe a couple of newer T-shirts. Will think about an evening outfit. Will only need 2\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Only 2?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m planning for shorts and T-shirts week and then change for dinner\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah. Maybe some nice linen shorts\/shirts\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Maybe 3 dinner shirts then. They can be used multiple days\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll get you to point out some stuff :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha okay\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I much prefer shopping for other people\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It is easier.\\
Any luck with the dresses? <This message was edited>\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup picked them up\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Will try at home and see\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your evening?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How many did you get?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just finishing off dinner then will go book our holiday. Day flew by again.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I may have gone round and round in excel making graphs\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think 4\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What did you have tonight?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also, our holiday :smiling-face-with-hearts: I'm proper soppy\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh what graphs are you making?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I had some of the pie from Saturday.\\
Been graphing the sensor data from my robot vs distance. Obviously :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:. Trying to see how to linearise the data so I can estimate distance based on the sensor reading.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nice!\\
Of course you have been :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: what are the results?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Inconclusive. I don’t get linear results but I’m not sure what to do about it or how important it might be.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah. So far you've figured everything out so you'll figure this out too\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How are your names spelt on your passport?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What Title do you use. Miss, Ms etc\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Miss\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: When is your passport expiring?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I need to get a new one\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Need to get a new mug shot taken and then apply online\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x\\
It's horrendous. You will have a very wet and muddy doggo. Pics please\\I'm still really fatigued. Woke up normal time but fell back asleep\\How are you? How did you sleep?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s not actually raining but will still be a bit naff on the walk.\\
Was planning on running later but again no one has actually said yes to my post.\\I didn’t sleep as well as I thought. Probably because I had to get up in the night.\\I saw adverts last night to grounding mats for the bed. Sounds a bit like magic but wondered if it’s something else that might help you.\\Do you have the capacity to pop over to see puppy today or save it for another time?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How about just joining the jeffing group? I would go with you but I have Steph.\\
I'm sorry you haven't slept very well. Hopefully easy day for you though\\Oh I haven't heard about those. If you see a link please send it over\\I don't think I'll be able to today. Everything is just taking me so long\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think I might have to risk the jeffing group. Might kill me.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: She's so loooong\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Might be good\/nice for you?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not sure about nice :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: just have to dig deep and go for it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You can do it!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00020538-VIDEO-2024-07-09-09-44-47.mov>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: She is huge!\\

This is one of them.\\Good luck with work. Just hang on in until lunch nap.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: This sounds a bit wishy washy for 80quid... I'll have a read properly later. Thank you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Enjoy your raptor day. What are you getting up to after walk?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It does seem a bit hand wavy magic. I remember reading about it a few years ago.\\
Could you ask in one of your groups if anyone else has tried one?\\Hopefully going to chill now for a bit before lunch then taking her over to see the parents.\\I’m itching to do more mouse stuff :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:. I may have become a bit obsessed.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I might pop it into one of the groups\\
Make sure you dry her :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\Aw I love that! What do you want to do?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have tried to dry it but she loves playing with a towel. If she doesn’t dry before I’m sure she will dry off in the car :loudly-crying-face:\\
Oh god there is so much.\\Currently trying to see if I can get somewhat accurate distances from sensor readings. Suspect my geometry isn’t as good as it could be so might see what I can do and live with it for now.\\Need to print out some blocks of know size so I can get really precise distance readings.\\Then there is the software.\\I discovered I’m only running on one core and I have 2. So I could be running the code twice as fast. Need to implement some multi threading to speed everything up or at least keep consistency tick timings.\\The search routine needs to be more clever to search the maze better.\\Need to save maze results so I can run the mouse after it’s discovered the maze.\\I need to make the mouse run through the maze rather than search through the maze.\\Make the mouse do smooth turns. At the moment it stops turns and then moves again.\\There there is diagonal turns to master as well.\\Just a few things :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\Solving the second core problem has a chance of making the mouse reasonable fast.\\If I end up trying to get competitive I either need to switch back and write the code in C or I found a faster board that can run python.\\I think once the maze problem is solved it should be able to run quite fast as there isn’t much thinking to do.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Those are not house jobs :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: they are robot jobs\\
But you'll get them done. Robot day tomorrow?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I did say mouse jobs not house jobs :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Yeah tomorrow and I need to do stuff for the group in Thursday\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: I come read that as house jobs :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone: I thought you were getting obsessed with cleaning :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I thought you had hacker group tomorrow?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not obsessed with cleaning :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: but I do like the end result. Hopefully my bedroom will still look clean by the time you see it again.\\
Yeah got hacker group. That’s at 7:30pm. Do want to try and build something for that.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: you never know, you might get obsessed with cleaning\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahahahahaha\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: When do you have Steph?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: There is a huge cloud now for rain.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 5.30\\
Are you going to Stuart's run?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think I’m going to have to.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yay!!!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I might die\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You'll smash it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Please don't die. I quite like you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll try. It would be a real downer\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Tomb stone.\\
“He died running.\\He hated running”\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have fun at the gym. Try not to break yourself.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you. I will try:rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have fun at the run!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I will try :loudly-crying-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Whoops, I didn’t see Stuart’s message until I’d parked :man-facepalming:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no, what happened?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Stuart couldn’t make it but 2 new people turned up who I had bet met before. We did my track session. So actually worked out well.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah brilliant! How was it?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00020576-GIF-2024-07-09-19-28-20.mp4>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just about to drive home\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I bet it felt a little good\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: A little good maybe. Need to check the stats but think it was reasonable fast and the rain helped a bit. Certainly better than running 5 miles.\\
How was Steph?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: She was determined to kill me\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I might have pb'd on deadlifts\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: OMG that’s amazing. Well done. What weight?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 85 :grimacing-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Also,\\
You - “I’m super tired not really feeling all that great”\\Also you on the same day - “i am strongest women ever rrrraaaarrrrr”\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh even better. Deadlifting above body weight.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just for one rep\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s still really good. Have you had a bath or spike mat?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Deadlifts and squats always kill me 2 days later\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: She made me do this horrendous leg extension set too\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Urgh, with her favourite Machine as well?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 10 reps, hold for 10s, 10 reps. I was going to cry\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh the hold! The hold hurts\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's not even the hold, it's the 10 reps after\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: They work though.\\
Like the hold squats Hannah makes me do.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: So painful\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Make sure to proper relax now then.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just little bits and pieces of sorting\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You in the office tomorrow?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No, still WFH. I'll have to go in on Thursday for assessment centre\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s good at least. Do you have something tomorrow evening?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Badge of hard work\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I need to get a Mani pedi somewhere. And pop to Matalan\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That was it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And I’m still dropping in on Thursday. I can bring your massive package\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That was meant to be a question of am I still dropping  in not an assumption that it was still ok?\\
Any luck with the dresses?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yea please, do drop in. Yes, Sue came through :smiling-face: I can show you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yes please :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Right, my glass butter dish just slipped from my drying rack and smashed all over my kitchen. I cut up my hands cleaning it up and now I'm paranoid that some sliver is left and the cat will eat it and die\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s a lot to process in a single message.\\
Change out all of his food and water that is on the floor.\\Turn the light off in the kitchen and use a torch (phone one will do) wiggle it at a low angle on the floor and it will show you any glass you may have missed\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: How bad is the cut?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Do you need me to come over?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Already done all of that\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just superficial ones, stabby\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm alright. Sorry didn't mean to scare you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Wasn’t scared.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Alright Mr tough\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I remember what it’s like on the odd occasion I broke glass with the dogs\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly, that's the way I relax apparently :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The final check I would do is *slowly* run my hand over the floor. That will 100\% find anything you have missed. But I’d do that after the hover\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I did that. Hence the cuts\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Obvs before the hoover. While I was cleaning :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's all good, just frustrated with extra work and I liked that dish\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But cat is very happy to have extra dinner\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I bet he is.\\
Sounds like you have done everything. So spud will be fine.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Could always throw down one of those kitchen floor cleaner wipe things and run it around again\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I did 7 :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: But if you’ve stabbed yourself, hovered and looked with a torch it has to be all gone\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's the rest of your evening been?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I ran, I’ve eaten and that’s it. Just about to go shower\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I remember one of the reasons the Tuesday run was a pain. Makes the evening super late\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It does. But you've done so well going!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Will try again next week. See if it can start the ball rolling with some track work. At least until they cut the grass and it goes away\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't think I'll be in any state to go next week but I'll come one of these days\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Next week you’re meant to be doing more of rule 1.\\
You will have some of money to chill \/ unpack \/ be glared at by cat.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Will I have some money?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh ffs. That was meant to be Monday\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha. I hopefully will\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Autocorrect is just not helpful\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Most of the time it isn't\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Right I  am now going to shower\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Enjoy!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You made it to bed yet?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I was just about to text :smiling-face:\\

I'm okay, still really fatigued and not sleeping great :woman-shrugging-light-skin-tone:\\That does sound very cool! Hope it works.\\How are you feeling? What are you up to today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Feeling ok, can tell I ran yesterday and I haven’t actually got up yet.\\
Plan for today is food. Sort out what I want to for nerd group later. I’ve got a model mechanical 7 segment display I want to build. Grand plans of designing my own to make a clock with all the free time I thought I’d have.\\Then robot. Gotta refocus on what I need to fix \/ implement for the competition\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: What do you think needs to change for your sleeping? My guess is that you probably getting too hot\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's a very productive day for you! Hope it all goes to plan\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't know, most probably my body. I also feel that the weighted blanket doesn't feel as weighed. I'm definitely not too warm tbh\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you get a new weighted blanket or was it just a thought?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I haven't as they don't make anything over 9kg\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So 2 weighted blankets then :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha probably\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: 15kg one\\

Have you managed a nap?\\I been graphing data in python like a proper nerd\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: So productive day then?\\
I haven't managed a nap but I did have lunch :smiling-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: maybe productive. Learning stuff, so that's good.\\
Well done on lunch\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's the afternoon been?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: its been ok. A bit of dithering. Had to hover as i'd dragged stuff in from the garage.\\
How's yours been? Are you all done now?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You are more than allowed a bit of pottering :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
Busy as always but escaped to get my trotters done.\\What time is nerd group?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: lol @ trotters\\
7:30, think that's why I've slowed down a bit. almost stuck in that weighting mode.\\Enjoying getting the feet done\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They definitely are at the moment :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
So none of the nerdies are watching football?\\Just enjoy a little rest. What are you having for dinner ?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: there is football :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
I've got the chilli I made for dinner. Not actually tried it yet so will see what its like. Are you all sorted for food\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The big one too :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Honestly I'm not sure yet. Probably an omelette. Need to pick up some eggs\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I guess i'll find out but I havn;t had the sense they are football people\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah, I'd think not :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Enjoy nerdy group :red-heart:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thanks. What are you up to?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not much. Just had dinner and pottering :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's it going at the group?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That a good evening. You need the rest as well. All packed?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Group is ok. Duncan has a new robot. Crazy levels of engineering\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Absolutely haven't even started :loudly-crying-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh cool! What does it do?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It follows the line like the old one. He just made it even smaller and more efficient.\\
Duncan really focuses on weight. Making the mice lighter.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: ADHD in full effect\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's the decades of experience. Hope you've had a good night\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've pottered all the way to bed. I've packed knickers, socks and swim suit :face-with-rolling-eyes:\\

Still quite all over the place, but don't need to go into office now so WFH.\\What a morning you've already had!.\\Good idea with the titans, shouldn't be too busy hopefully\\What's the plan for today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Full WFH week for you. That must be odd for you?\\
I should have looked yesterday to see. That 2 workouts that have been messed up this week because I didn’t plan properly.\\Plan will be. Gym, food, then I need to do this work I owe the robot club so that’s done. Will see how long that takes.\\What time is good for me to come over and say hello and drop off your packages?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah a bit odd bit also super helpful to be honest. I'll probably do a full week in when I'm back.\\
Ah hopefully you can plan better for next week :smiling-face: and Hannah is back so that should help.\\Is 6pm good?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah I can do 6pm. :red-heart:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Can't wait :red-heart:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was gym?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: it happened. Wasn't the best. Found Hannah and Toria there.\\
Managed an hour, did a bit of bench. Think the tiredness hindered a bit but good to get stuff done\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hows the day going?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: random thought - to download some Netflix stuff on your phone for something to watch on the plane\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You still went, that's good. How's the rest of the day been?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Busy. I had a nap :grimacing-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll be either reading or listening to podcasts\/audiobook :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Nap is good.\\
After breakfast I spoke to Ross for a bit and have started the document I promised the robot club. Feels like consulting again :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: Now just about to have lunch.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah but I could have been packing or something\\
Haha, what are you doing for the robot club?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You’ll have to pack later and you seem to do better when you have a nap.\\
I’m helping to coordinate a new robot offering from the group that is aimed at new people and education.\\Just the next version of what they already have. Trying to lower the barrier of entry.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah yes. How's it coming along?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s already 3 pages and barely started :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh right, that is a long day then. At least it is done now.\\
Soap bag, 3 dresses in the bag, couple of cosy clothes and your all set. Plus shoes.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: no\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I still don't know which dresses\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I'll help with that\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: do you at least have a selection of dresses that fit?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes! I am waiting for you for that :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: well that's easy then\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll need to wash my hair so soz for being wet haired when you get here\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: that's absolutely fine\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: still 6pm?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes please\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Guess who hasn't had lunch\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You'd think I'd be size 4 by the way I skip meals :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: well I know I had lunch\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know this is your first time deliberately taking time off work while work is still happening but if you have to do more work so that you can take time off work then your not really taking time off\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well I needed to tie up loose ends\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: have you turned on your out of office\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup\\

Not that I saw that\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What?!?!?!!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: we used to charge clients over £1000 a day for each of us\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's crazy\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: If I was a contractor I could have charged about £500\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: We were just that good\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: thats also why we never had much time to get stuff done\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: and then you work out that I probably did 200 days at arm. That's just one client. They did get a bulk discount though. Probably £800 a day\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Jeez\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The crazy world of corporate\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Indeed\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Running a smidge behind. Just need to get dressed and load the car\\

This is painful :sleeping-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: On the way. Do you want me to come up to get the case?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That would be very helpful, thank you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Home.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good. Hope you manage a little nap\\
Thank you for dropping me :red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not going to risk a nap before my session. Will just have breakfast and watch some tv. Might risk a nap later.\\
Enjoy the airport.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Airport is not very enjoyable.\\
On the plane now. Will text when I have WiFi\/internet.\\Love you :red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh no. At least you’re on the plane now.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Kid behind me :loudly-crying-face: kill me\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Doh, another reason why I go back of the bus\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah fair\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I need to put my sexy socks on\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hope the flight went ok. As long as you didn’t crawl off.\\
We messed up counting twice at the gym today. Thought I’d done 5x200 but was only 180.\\It was meant to be 180\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Arrived. I almost kicked the child behind me :upside-down-face: apart from that all good so far\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I guess the parents were doing nothing?\\
As always other people ruin everything.\\Keep going. A nap is in sight.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It was one of those gentle parenting things :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your morning been?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Friday morning counting with little sleep is hard. Super well done on 180\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: While it feels like I’ve been awake all day all I’ve done is the gym and I at breakfast.\\
I thinking about doing something.\\Going to do some robot stuff at some point\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We're in the taxi now. It's quite pleasant weather. Not super sunny or hot\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s good. Hopefully you can get an early checking or at least find a place for a sit down and lunch.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Got to the hotel and will be able to check in in 15mins :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That's good. Lunch and nap then?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Tried a nap but just couldn't fall asleep so hunting for food. Forgot all restaurants close at 2.30 :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: To excited I guess. Any chance of a nap before it all kicks off later?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I see how I go but I might just eat, shower and slowly get ready\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your afternoon?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Is that a slab of butter?\\
I have crashed from lunch. Need to move and do something\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes it is. And it's beautiful\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What did you have for lunch?\\
You can have an easy afternoon, you have gotten up at the crack of dawn\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Had your chicken burger. A bit more dense than I was expecting but good.\\
I’ve got a little while before I need to feed spud. I’ll see if I can re write my Bluetooth controller for the mouse.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes it was definitely denser than a beef one.\\
Hope it works! I keep forgetting I'm an hour ahead\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh yeah, I hadn't even thought of that. That might help a bit then\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Wow, look at you :fire::fire:\\
Have fun.\\Cat has been fed.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you. Hope he gave you a cuddle.\\
Enjoy your evening with Lester\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: At home.\\
Hope your evening has gone well. If guessing you’re about to get in the taxi.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just got in the shuttle.\\
How was your evening?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was nice. Fairly chill. Frighteningly expensive for what we did \/ drunk. Think the next evening will be at my place and we can burn stuff.\\
How was yours? How have you been holding up?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Glad you had a good time. Where did you go?\\
Haha, that's such a boy evening :smiling-face:\\It's been super lovely. Would have loved to have been with you, you'd enjoy it :smiling-face:\\I'm up and not crying. Can't wait to get into bed\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Went to the Spencer for a drink and then  mad squirrel and Matt joined us at Heidrun for the last few. Pretty standard Wycombe night really.\\
Glad you’ve had a good time. At least you can have a lie in (hopefully) before it all kicks off again again tomorrow.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How are the boys?\\
Breakfast is early but will have a nap\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: They are good. Matt just back from holiday. So he needed a night out to relax :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Lester is about normal. Has a holiday booked for August at the isle of white.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha of course. Did you find out where they went? :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Crete. I made sure to check\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nice!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just got back to the hotel\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think it was quite an expensive holiday for just a week. Business class etc\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done.\\
I best wish you good night as I’ll be going to bed soon enough.\\Night night x x x x x x x\\Hope you sleep well in the hotel.\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night x x x x x x x x x\\

Sleep well.\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00020805-GIF-2024-07-13-07-20-48.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x\\
I slept some :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: just about to go for breakfast.\\How are you feeling?\\Oh I hope it is! Enjoy it\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Some is good. Was it much worse than at home? First night in a hotel is always the worst.\\
I’m ok. Tired more than anything. Think it will hit today worse than yesterday. We were fairly sensible with the drinks and didn’t go mad.\\Can feel the legs though from yesterday.\\What your plan before the wedding stuff all kicks off?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It was a bit worse. The bed is memory foam, but I guess I was really tired last night\\
Ah that's good you've been sensible. Take it easy on the parkrun.\\I haven't got much plan. Will probably chill on my balcony for a bit. Have a nap and then get ready.\\What are you up to after parkrun?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not really sure on the day yet. Need to do some gardening and robot this weekend so will see what I fancy once I get back.\\
Enjoy some relaxing.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have fun at parkrun :red-heart:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Fastest parkrun for a while. Everything hurts. Probably not related :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Hope the day is going well for you :red-heart:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ooooh well done!! What time did you do?\\
I had a nap and just starting to get ready :smiling-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did a 38:37. So much better than the 40:?? Something I did last week. Could really feel the workout and the beers working against me.\\
Well done in the nap. How broken are you?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That is an amazing jump! Well done.\\
I can imagine. At out age every thing works against us :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\I am reasonably broken.\\What are you up to this afternoon? Garden?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Looking very pretty again. :red-heart:\\
Sorry the brokenness is so high :face-with-head-bandage:\\Yeah garden today. Just about to have a stab at some of it.\\Enjoy the day.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I miss your face\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Your saw my face yesterday :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
But yes. I miss your face as well.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well I miss you being here :woman-shrugging-light-skin-tone: just let me be soppy\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :red-heart:\\
What’s the drink? Looks fancy.\\Looks like perfect weather.\\Bit more cloud here. I’m on hour 2 of gardening. Ive done stuff at the tippy top and ready to mow the lawn now :man-facepalming:\\I’ve had a new idea. Bark chipping!!!! EVERYWHERE\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh tonic water with some syrop.\\
The weather is gorgeous :smiling-face-with-hearts: it is so so lovely. The ceremony was beautiful, Bev cried at my reading. I didn't stutter. It's such a lovely day\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Aww that good. Glad you having a good day.\\
I’ve finally given up gardening. Might do some more tomorrow but will see. About to shower and then go check on spud.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did you get loads done?\\
Thank you, give him a cuddle please.\\We're just sitting down for dins. Are they up to anything tonight?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think I did but it took ages. There is ivy everywhere at the top. Might be what killed the grass.\\
I have tried to hug the spud, he was half receptive. He didn’t eat a lot of his wet food but did eat almost all his dry food.\\That looks nice and fancy\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Omg his face looks so sad\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How did he seem?\\
Thank you for popping in on him\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: He seemed fine. Wanted a bit of affection but not too much :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
The pic is when he was trying to sniff my hand.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, sounds about right :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Thank you.\\What are you up to?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that looks good! Have a restful evening x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s the plan. The fire burned way too fast and was throwing bits of ash all over. Need better wood.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What did you burn?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Some of the broken trellis I had. Burns very fast and all the other stuff I have is too big. Will have to try and get some\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And then we can do some marshmallows :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Probably need better wood for food as well.\\
How are you holding up?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm holding myself up\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: <attached: 00020841-VIDEO-2024-07-13-21-48-27.mp4>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: DJ needs to play some harder EDM stuff :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: get the place jumping.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's a wedding not a rave :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
It's really small and it's so lovely\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ve made it to bed. Are you still out and about?\\
I’ll wish you good night x x x x x x x\\Let me know when you make it back to the hotel.\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart: <This message was edited>\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Still out. The shuttle is coming at 1 :sleeping-face:\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm back at the hotel.Hope you're sleeping well. :red-heart:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00020848-GIF-2024-07-14-08-55-14.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x\\
It was lovely. Tbh I just waited for the shuttle chatting to people.\\Just about to get ready to go again. I am so tired\\They will be going to watch football but I'm not going.\\How are you? What are you up to today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You’re doing really well. I think I’ve slept more than you have.\\
I’m ok. Can still feel the tired from Friday, so can only imagine how your doing. Can also feel the gym, run, gardening.\\I might try the scarifier today just because I want to see what it does. There was a game mentioned on Friday I might try out or I’ll have a go at some mouse stuff or both.\\Aiming for a bit of a chill out day today.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't know how I'm still standing tbh.\\
Oh that sounds fun! Let me know what it does. Is there a race on today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sheer will power will be my bet\\
No race this week but then 2 back to back before the break. Irritating as my favourite race of the year is while I’m in Manchester. I might have to have it on my phone.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't know how much I have left.\\
Ah okay. Well hopefully you have a nice chilled day. I'm getting picked up in half hour\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Enjoy, you can have a rest later and hopefully a chill out week.\\
When you can can you send me you flight number\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
It's BA0373\\Should be getting in at 12.20 but have luggage so probably 1.15 is a better time\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok. I’m pretty sure the guy I used leaves for the airport once the plan has landed and then the timings of getting ti the airport match up with collecting bags etc.\\
I’ll check later but I think there is a coffee place in the terminal near the short stay that we can meet. Will confirm all of that later\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's probably a better idea.\\
Would you like any airport treats?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Part of me says yes but I don’t need airport treats. Thank you though.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nothing you'd like? Doesn't have to be sweets :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No you’re fine.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki :red-heart:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That all looks so nice. Enjoy. :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly it's so gorgeous here\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Is there music?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What are you up to?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m playing a new game Lester mentioned on Friday :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha nice. What is it?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s called frost punk. A city builder game where you’re fighting against the cold and the normal resource management stuff. Seems quite good but quite hard.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that sounds interesting. Enjoy\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aww you're the best. Thank you so much for popping in. Are you up to much tonight? We're just on our way back to hotels\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Think I’ll just get some food and then play some more of this game.\\
An early night for you then :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, you proper got into it didn't you?\\
I need to shower, dry my hair and then pack\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I might have yeah. That's the risk with a new game.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did you have a nice weekend?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It has been nice, never get as much done as I’d like but still good.\\
Have you enjoyed yourself?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes it's been gorgeous.\\
Did you miss me though?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah I did miss you but I know I’ll see you tomorrow.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okay fair enough. The logic is sound I guess :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well I did miss you too\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm in bed. Early start tomorrow.\\
Hope you had a good evening.\\Night night x x x x x x x x x\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: A lot of hurry up and wait for you tomorrow.\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x\\
Just in the taxi now waiting for the girls.\\How come today is the only one?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Early trip to the airport.\\
The Thursday one has disappeared and I’ve now got Hannah tomorrow morning instead of today. Will have to sort something else out for Wednesday\/ Thursday.\\Good luck at the airport. How are you feeling?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah alright. Thank you for swapping Hannah for picking me up.\\
Just at the airport. I am broken\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was spin?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I didn’t swap so I could pick you up. Hannah asked for the swap. I’m guessing Richard needs to get to the office early or something.\\
Spin. I went. There were 4 of us at least. Just so boring when it’s not done to the music.\\You may remember it’s my brother birthday today. There was talk of a family dinner. That isn’t happening or at least not happening today.\\There is going to be cake chaos however around 3:40 at my brothers place. Literally crazy time as they have to get the kids to various sport things and leave the house at 5pm.\\Absolutely no pressure but up to you if you would like to join.\\I didn’t want to just assume you’d rather stay at home.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okay then. No thanks :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
I do remember. In all honesty I really don't know. I'm feeling pretty rough but might see how I feel later\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hope the flight goes well and you can see how you feel later.\\
I’m expecting the full tear’s experience at my brothers. One or both of the children will be having some sort of food \/ cake \/ pudding related breakdown and that’s before the time pressure kicks in.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just boarding. See you in a bit\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Checking the map. I'll meet \/ find you at the costa coffee that should be right in front of you as you leave, after getting your bag. From facing costa I'll meet you on the left side.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Parked, on my way in\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Would you like anything from Costa?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just through passport\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: One of those frappucino things, coffee one, no cream thank you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok, I’ve ordered something :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha thanks\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just waiting for bag\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I was clearly optimistic based on your landing time :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Very. We were stuck on tarmac for half hour I think not having a gate\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But we did land at like 12 so technically only 15mins late\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sounds about right.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I need to get those ride on trunks\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, would be speedy.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Speedier than this wobble :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Omg still no bags <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Bags take FOREVER\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You either wait at passport or wait for bags\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You can see why people don’t want to check a bag now\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I was straight through passport\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh, that won’t help\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Meh, I'd rather wait than not have my stuff\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah, not even the whole plane is here yet\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Uk passport might have been slow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: True true. Some bags now\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Woo\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I got excited. But someone else has also a yellow bag\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh no, sure it’s not yours? Had that happen before.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Also how are there two bright yellow cases :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Definitely not mine. Mine has stickers\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Two super amazing people who have similar style :woman-shrugging-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I guess so\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Coming\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How was the nap?\\
The chaos was crazy. I think 7 indervidial sets of crying. Eleanor 4 and Oliver 3\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Short but needed.\\
I was just about to text to ask how it all went. Did mark like his presents?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah he seemed to. I think once the kids go to bed he’ll be able to check what he actually got :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you found food?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha. God it must be hard for everything to be always overtaken\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I did :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh do you want to do the moonlight swim on Sunday? Swim, music and pizza ?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I wondered when that was. Yes we can do that. Hopefully it’s a bit nicer than today.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Brill. I'll see what time Katie etc are booking for\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sounds good.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Are you pottering or are you trying to relaxing?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have been relaxing but will throw in some laundry soon\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have you been up to much?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00020943-GIF-2024-07-15-18-17-49.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just got home so having food. Playing games with Matt later. Going to see if I can squeeze in some robot in between as had some ideas in the car earlier about how the multi threading might work \/ a bug I might have had for a while.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sounds like a good Sunday night.\\
I've got Michelle tomorrow and bookclub on Wednesday. Shall we do something on Thursday?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You remember that it’s Monday today? :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
I have pencilled in to see Becky on Thursday as I wondered if we would do Wednesday but I can see to swap. Not confirmed anyway as she might be busy. She hasn’t had the best couple of weeks as she’s gone from going on holiday with her family to it ending with the discovery her Dad has some very serious and probably soon to be fatal lung cancer.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well apparently not :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Oh that's really crap. I hope she's doing as alright as can be in the situation. I'm not sure if me coming with would be an idea but if she can't swap that's fine :smiling-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 8pm on the Sunday for swims\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m sure it wouldn’t have been a problem for you to join us for dinner and we do need to arrange another one. Worked out anyway as she can’t do Thursday so have switched to Wednesday.\\
So Thursday is good for us.\\Are you free Friday as well.\\That is late food on Sunday :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: but great.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. That's sorted :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
I hope she's okay. Do send her my love\\I've got us the tickets\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think she is about as ok as you can be. Too many unknowns all of which don’t really matter as her Dad probably has weeks left instead of the years she expected.\\
Well done :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's such a tough situation\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, a real shame. It’s another one of those limbo states with nothing you can do about it.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah, I think that's the worst when you can't do anything about it.\\
How's nan doing? Setting in?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: She seems to be settling in and was watching the tennis but Dad was saying they were looking at a different home to move her to. I think it’s cheaper but it wasn’t clear and not easy to talk about at Mark’s.\\
She has apparently said she doesn’t see anyone but I pointed out to dad again that for 40 years Nan has aggressively not wanted to see anyone. Plus she is around people now.\\I’m hoping a chat with his friend Kevin while they are away this week might yield something positive.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully when she's in a long-term place she'll be forced to socialise a little bit.\\
Where are the parentals off to?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: She must of had to socialise a bit because she was out of her room watching the tennis. I think it’s a bit of an attempt on her part to make my Dad feel guilty to try and make him go more.\\
Somewhere in or near Devon. I think.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Omg I thought I replied :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone::woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How have the games gone?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Easily done.\\
Games have been ok. Very mixed. Nothing amazing and some awful\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: My brain is mush today, sorry.\\
I'm all tucked in. It will be a chore tomorrow morning :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\Thank you for looking after Spuddles this weekend and the airport trips. :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\Night night when you get to bed. x x x x x x x x x x x x\\Sleep well\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good luck tomorrow.\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s still my mistake.\\
Mornings been ok. After the first raptor 20 minutes she has been asleep \/ playing with a toy so I’ve not been out for a walk yet. I was going to take her straight out to calm her down but she’s been good.\\Mum is on her way over. So that’s another hour\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Give her a cuddle for me and say hello to mum :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's raptoring going?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Going pretty well. She is currently asleep. Nice walk over the woods.\\
How are you doing?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh nice! Glad you're having a good day. How's mum?\\
I'm struggling. So tired :sleeping-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: She’s ok. They had a bit of a mixed visit with Nan on Saturday but it seemed to lead to my mum and dad actually having a constructive conversation about what is going to happen moving forward.\\
So small progress. There has also been some progress in the council doing something.\\No viewings on the house yet which is a shame.\\Not much of the day left. You can do it.\\Are you still seeing Michelle? I assume she can still walk after her 50km at the weekend.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Small progress is still good.\\
So weird there haven't been any viewings.\\Michelle is now coming to me for a cuppa. I'm just leaving work and will pop into Aldi.\\Is the raptor being picked up?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Very odd about the lack of viewing.\\
That’s a better setup if Michelle is coming to you. Are you going to discuss the plan for Saturday?\\Raptor has gone. Got picked up. So I pottered and made some more mess in the garden.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes we will. But I'm betting she has forgotten :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Ah well done on the garden.\\How was Hannah?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Was a good gym session. We tried out the new massage table \/ laying down chest pull machine. It worked.\\
Manage to jump up a bunch of weight on back rows. So that’s nice.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's such a weird machine.\\
Well done on the back rows too!\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: <attached: 00020998-GIF-2024-07-16-17-35-31.mp4>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thank you.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Maybe one day.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Michelle just been. We'll do Thai restaurant on Saturday :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Which Thai one? Sounds good though.\\
Only Peter turned up and he wanted the jeffing group so he is off round the rye and I’m at the track like billy no mates :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: One in Watlington. It's really nice\\
Oh which Peter?\\Did you still run?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not sure I know that one but looking forward to it.\\
Not sure on surname. Not Trousers. The one that replied to my post. I did Wolf Run with him earlier in the year. He seems obsessed with running parkrun.\\Running now. It’s so much worse without other people.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: <attached: 00021005-GIF-2024-07-16-18-49-40.mp4>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well, done. That was shit. Had to skip 400 of the 2nd 600m  it got the rest done. On for just under 15km in the same 7 days so that’s something at least.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Also are we seeing each other Friday?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well done on getting through!!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's the last day of term so I'm thinking of popping down to school to see everyone\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That was it, although I was looking for a more binary answer.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Pardon?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I was expecting a bit more of a yes or no answer\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh sorry\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m guessing no if your meeting up with school\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: If I can get a couple of hours off in the afternoon I'll go. Would be nice to have a little bit of a leaving do\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh yeah, you should absolutely do it.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You don't mind?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No, why would I mind you having a leaving do \/ meeting up with people\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't know. We haven't had much time together recently\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know. It’s not like this is a weekly thing it’s a one or never thing so you should do it.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you home and eaten?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Home and showered. Food is next.\\
Tuesday run always makes the evening very late\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What are you having tonight?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: This honey chicken chipotle thing I’ve made in the slow cooker. Freezer is full of meals now.\\
Have you found food?\\What do you fancy on Thursday?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh well done! How long are you sorted for now?\\
I've picked up a pizza in the shop, just couldn't even think about cooking\\Oh I don't know. Something easy? Maybe the rice?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Probably got 3 weeks worth. Plan is to try and keep it topped up.\\
That’s was my thoughts for loading the freezer. Pick tomorrow’s dinner from the freezer in the morning and then it just needs reheating. I have 2 or 3 options now rather than cook the same thing for the week.\\Of the rice is a good idea. That might make enough for me on Friday as well.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But you know how I am with freezer food :loudly-crying-face: I'd love to be able to do it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: All tucked up in bed. How's your short evening been?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done.\\
Just playing some games with Matt. I need a better player :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha you keep saying that\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to say night night now x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x y\\
Well this is a proper lay in for you :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: you must have needed it.\\I'm still broken and just want to sleep. But at least it's sunny.\\What's your plan today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: A bit more of a lie in than I was planning for but I did need it.\\
:smiling-face-with-hearts: early night for you?\\Food and then mouse today. Got some tests to do then back to trying to make it work better.\\Then Becky and Poppy (dog) are coming over about 7.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm glad you were able to do it :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
I think so. I think the bookclub is getting postponed which really works for me\\Hope Becky is alright. Say hello for me please\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hope you manage to get through the day ok :red-heart:\\
Do you have a day WFH this week?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think I'll WFH tomorrow and Friday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s a bit of a result then as you thought Friday might be office as well. Some lie in and lunch naps for you then.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No one is in the office tomorrow and not needed here on Friday so might as well\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also... Yes please to your paired weekend away idea!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, thought you’d like it.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Small bit of luck. Because I emailed the parking people at Heathrow they are going to adjust the fine to be the £5 charge.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that's brilliant! Well done\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your day been?\\
Katie persuaded me to go for a swim\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: The day has been fast without feeling like much has been done.\\
No book club then.\\Great day for a swim though, enjoy.\\How was your day?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What did you get up to? Mouse getting there?\\
I don't think it's happening.\\Day was alright. I'm just wobbly and stiff. Really hoping the water will help\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Mouse stuff and some house tidying, had to go to lidl and still forgot something.\\
Have spent a lot of time testing stuff to basically find out that I don't have an obvious way of increasing the processing speed. I do have a better understanding of how the underlying operating system handles interrupts and timing events. Although I still have an unanswered question around the timers but it won't matter. A bit of a shame but now I need to focus on the known improvements I can make. Will see how well I can do. Got a good few days I can put in before Manchester.\\Hopefully the water will help. Try not to drown. :red-heart:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh what did you forget? I can bring it tomorrow\\
That's sounds like progress! You've been working very hard on this and you still have loads of time to make it even better\\I will try :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Didn't realise I dont have any peas for dinner tomorrow. I can get some if you dont already have any\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I have loads!! I'll bring them\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: do try and not drown. It will be a real bummer of a day otherwise.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha\\
A real bummer?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: not a word you've seen before?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Of course I have :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just such a romantic notion :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It made me giggle\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: ahh right. It was the ? that through me\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh sorry!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: it would have been a lot less funny to right totally devastating. So bummer it was\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: write even\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: instead of right\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It would have been\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And you did make me giggle\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: that's good\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What are you having for dinner tonight?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: cooking the chickpea curry tonight\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh nice\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How was swimming?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It was really nice. How's your evening with Becky going?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh good, you didn’t drown then.\\
Going ok. Her dad really isn’t doing very well. Pain management is really poor and they scared him about taking morphine (the hospital did) so he won’t take it. He probably won’t make his Monday hospital appointment.\\At least she doesn’t have the kids this week.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I really tried not to\\
Oh that's so so hard. I hope she can spend all the time with him. I can't even imagine how she's feeling\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm all tucked in bed.\\
Hope coming round has helped Becky think of other things\\Night night x x x x x x x x\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night night x x x x x x x x x x\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x\\
I'm glad you're sleeping better\/longer.\\I had a horrid night of tossing and turning.\\How was last night?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh that’s no fun for you. Can you get a nap later? It has got a bit warmer.\\
Last night was ok. I think it helped distract Becky for a little bit. At the end she took a call from her sister in law and the family what’s up was going mental.\\Her brother is rock solid in believing that once they start treatment her dad will get better but Becky knows too much and the rest of the family agree. He is very unlikely to see next week. He is a lot of pain. 10\/10 level and now being given fentanyl.\\It’s the helplessness that seems to be very draining for everyone. Very unimpressed of how the doctors have delt with it all Becky’s had to complain and point out that at Wycombe that would have already done a lot more and faster. He is dropping faster than the processes to help can catch up or even be activated.\\So all a bit of a mess really with also nothing much to do other than wait.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: God I really feel for her. It's the shittest situation. Please give her my love\\
What's your plan for today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Plan today is same as yesterday it hopefully with more sucess. More robot. I’m done with the experiments. Just need it to work better. Then after Manchester I can switch focus to house stuff and other jobs.\\
So food, robot and then I get to see you. Assuming you’re still up for it.\\I might go on the indoor bike but the body is still a bit ruined. Will see\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes definitely still up for it. Should be finishing work at 5ish\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So 6pm at mine?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes I'll be aiming for that :slightly-smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How are you holding up?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've had a nap. How's your day going?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done.\\
I’m making progress. So that good. Currently building up a bit of a simulator so I can test out the maze solving algorithm.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well done :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How’s it going?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just getting ready. Should be leaving in 10\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Great. Don’t forget peas\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Already by the door\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also, Michelle just texted if we could do a different restaurant - they are already booked in there next weekend.\\
Would you be alright with Kappad?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: \#winningatlife\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have no idea what Kappad is but sure\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's south Indian. Really nice\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Let’s go for it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Brill. I'll let her know\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you for dinner :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Your very welcome :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I can cook next week :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sure. I don’t mind cooking though.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know. And I do love your cooking. Just want to do something nice for you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: We can do that. Can plan it at the weekend.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okie doke\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you doing anything for the rest of the evening?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No really. I’ve made breakfast and protein shake for the morning and currently sitting. Will watch some you tube and then go shut the computer down before bed. Slightly earlier night needed tonight as I actually have to get up when the alarm goes off.\\
Are you on your closing shift?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am pottering on my way to bed. Will take meds and get tucked in\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: All tucked in.\\
Night night x x x x x x x x x x x hope you sleep well\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night night x x x x x x x x\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x\\
Thank you. I am already so warm :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\No, very tossy turny again. Did you manage to get some good sleep?\\Hope you have a good session with Hannah :red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I got some sleep, just not long enough. The ac doesn’t seem quite as good as it was. So need to have a look at that.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Felt quite nice yesterday. Hopefully it's an easy fix.\\
Just got to spade Oak and it's waaaaarm.\\Enjoy the circuits. Please remain alive\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is the plan. The staying alive bit. You too.\\
Soo, your body runs on sun but not heat. Where is that place that is sun all the time but 5c that’s what you need\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, I'll go with sun all the time and 20 degrees :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
How was the sesh?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Brutal. It was squats. So by the end of the weekend I might no be able to walk.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh nooooo. You were saying light leg day :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
What are you up to today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That was the thought but really no point a session being easy.\\
Used that new leg swing \/ show your arse to the room machine. That’s odd.\\Just picked up poppy. Will see if she settles so I can use the computer but might all be too hot. Going to mikes for 5.\\You still planning for a chill evening?\\Next week I am out Thursday but otherwise free. I’m not sure if I’ll run Tuesday evening yet.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh what machine?\\
I'm going to go for a sesh tomorrow morning. Feel like I need to lift some heavy shit.\\I bet she'll be a bit unsettled with this weather. You can both hose down.\\Yes. I just want to tidy up and sort some bits.\\We could do lake on Wednesday? Supposed to be hot. And something Tues if you end up not running\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Wednesday is good assuming the kraken doesn’t get me on Sunday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What are you thoughts on timing tomorrow. Are we seeing each other in the afternoon or are we just going for dinner?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh spoke to Michelle this morning and booked table for 7.30.\\
I'll need a nap but could come to you for like 4-4.30?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That works. We get a couple of hours together before going out.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: more farm boops from Lisa\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Who knew cows would be cute\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's a sheep :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: thought it was a small cow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hiya Lucy. Michelle might have mentioned that we are here at the weekend (I am here frying today)\\
\url{https://www.tradboatfestival.com/who-will-be-at-the-trad}\\It’s the first time I have been to this show, and I have been told that Saturday evening is “when everything happens” and is “highly recommended”.\\Can I be a complete PITA please and ask if we can defer our evening out planned for Saturday? Or - even - do you want to come to the show? While boats are not entirely my thing - there are some absolutely gorgeous ones here.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Adrian just messaged\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Do you want to go to your friend's thing instead?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Or we can still go for dinner\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What would you like to do?\\
I cannot even work out where the boat thing is as it all says Henley but there is no crooked billet pub in Henley\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: To be honest I'm not too fussed about the boat show but would go if you wanted to\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I like boats but it doesn't look like my thing and if its going to be super busy its always a pain to get there and back\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, I certainly don't like boats enough for us to pay £20 each to get in\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What do you fancy then?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I'm not too fussed about the party thing and Lester isn't going. Not sure I would know anyone else. I'll find out where it is. Other wise we can just have the evening together plus you might be able to get a better bed time now for you 3am balloon watching extravaganza\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, that sounds good!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: actually the drinks thing isn't till 9 anyway So I could always go if I want to after you go to bed :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: planning stuff is so difficult :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh lord isn't it just\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: To be clear, you could have come with me. I'm not trying to hide you from people. Just being practical based on your other plans\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: although this does now create a HUGE problem. The worst problem in being an adult. WHAT do we now have for dinner :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I knoooooow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's why I said we could still go for dinner :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh we could have a pizza picnic in the garden\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I mean you did say yesterday you would cook, so I could just leave it all to you :face-with-tears-of-joy: or we could do an easy dinner. Steak.\\
We could go out but that does get expensive. We could do the Italian in little marlow?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: the garden you say. WITH THE BUGS\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: but yes that would work\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I really fancy pizza\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We can either do your base one or I can get some from ahop\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: that's where my little marlow came from. I could get a base out and make pizza\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: will need extra's to go with the pizza\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: With like proper toppings not just cheese?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: whats proper toppings then\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Pepperoni, salami, goats cheese, jalapenos stuff like that\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I can stop in the shop on my way to yours\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: goats cheese is cheese :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
I can get that minus the jalapenos. I can get stuff after parkrun.\\What about not pizza extra's\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What do you fancy?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll pick up sides\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: its idea's for the sides. My brain just goes "Chips" or Garlic bread but there has to be other. I'll let your brain work on that. I can get everything from Lidl tomorrow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I will get sides!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: just trying to save you a trip :face-blowing-a-kiss:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know but I want to\\
It will be on the way anyway\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: ok <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to try have a quick nap\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: good plan\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: sleep fast :red-heart:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: \url{https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGenhLKmn/}\\
:rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: this is basically what we have done.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yah :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was poppy?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: She was good. Bit crazy at times but I can just about trust her in the garden so that is easier\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aw that's good\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: she got picked up before 1pm so I didn't have her for very long\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What have you been up to?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: other than dog and lunch I'm still working on Maze code. Just trying to integrate it into the actually mouse now so I can do real world testing\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Real world testing. Woo hoo!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just realised I dont have a way to pre calculate a route on the mouse. So writing that. All of my stuff at the moment "know" what the maze is\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You're so very clever\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Btw, after Manchester. Can we sit down and try to work out that flow from form to spreadsheet I mentioned?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: for work, sure\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, Thank you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: This will be the first thing id watch \url{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q7W1BX-gvaA}\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: and then this \url{https://powerusers.microsoft.com/t5/Building-Flows/Automatic-update-of-Microsoft-Forms-Data-into-an-Excel/td-p/2275531}\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thaaanks\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Then you'll find out how much access you might be missing on the platform\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Coolio\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What time are you leaving for mike's?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Probably in about 15 mins or so\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope you have a good evening :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thanks, hope you are able to chill a bit. Cool bath might help\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll definitely need one after cleaning\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Back home. How’s your evening been?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was it? Did you have a good night?\\
It's been fine. I pottered around very slowly tidying and cleaning\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was good. Not sure the last time it was just Mike and I.\\
He was funny as he hadn’t really been in his garden without the rest of the family around. He was very suprised with the piece and how nice the quiet was :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\Well done. Is it all done now?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I didn't realise it was just the two of you. Thought he was having a get together.\\
I'm glad you had some quality time.\\I mean it's as done as ever :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\Are you parkrunning?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: There were meant to be others but everyone else bailed.\\
Yeah that is the plan. To parkrun.\\Are you still going to lift heavy things?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah it was still nice though\\
Yup, still the plan. I'm just cutting off sleeves of some gym t-shirts :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It is very warm\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have already put the AC on to see what it can do\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've put the fan on\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: There really cool. Were you actually cutting the sleeves off. I thought that was a joke\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha yes I was undoing the seams :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You don’t like the sleeves then?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not in the summer. And I've been looking for a tee like that but couldn't find any so made them. And these were like £5 at the comic con\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm all tucked in now. Don't rest your eyes on the couch :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\

I shouldn’t fall asleep on the sofa :crossed-fingers:\\Night night x x x x x x x x x x x x\\Hope you sleep better\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00021222-GIF-2024-07-20-07-51-43.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x\\
I am but definitely not wearing that :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\Did you sleep well?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: But that a normal gym outfit :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
It’s amazing what weird GIFs you can find.\\Slept ok. Woke up a few times which is just annoying.\\Did you sleep any better?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, of course :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Still tossing and turning. Had to switch the fan off in the middle of the night as kept waking me up :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ready for PR?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: But fan noise is best noise :grinning-face:\\
I’m not sure about ready but I’m going. It seem cooler than I feared it might be so that’s good.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's raining a bit but like the fine mist type\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh that could be good then. Hides the tears and stops the bugs.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Enjoy\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How was the gym?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It was good\\
I'm absolutely soaked.\\How was PR?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I ran, I finished, I sweaty.\\
Actually it bad. Did the first km slow and that helped. Overall a bit slow but felt better for it.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well done! What was your time today?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: 38:05\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That is brilliant! You're getting faster :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Slowly, if I can fix the mental block of running for too long I’ll be even quicker\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You can!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll get there. Are we doing YPOM fest on Tuesday? Get Katie involved? I saw her this morning.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, today was 50 seconds faster than last week!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah we can. I'll talk to her tomorrow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know! So much faster\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I didn’t realise I was fast when I first sent you time\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I assume you’ve just had a nap?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes yes I had\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have you been up to much?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No, I did Starbucks, shopping and I’ve had lunch. Just about to start moving.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well you've done so much more than me :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not by much. You’ve gym’d and had a nap.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: We still on for 4:30?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And breakfast!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: See, that’s 3 things!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: 4 if you include waking up and 5 including getting dressed\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I need to get moving\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What do you need to do?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm not sure :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: there's probably something\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Is there anything you need to prep for tomorrow morning?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't know. There's no plan yet\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Katie was wavering on the whole thing\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Laura definitely wants to go\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to pop to Morrisons for some sides. What do you fancy?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: \url{https://maps.app.goo.gl/stCVocgrTvt2JGUr9?g-st=iw}\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Erm, I have no idea\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha ok. I'll pick up something\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The internet says garlic bread and mozzarella sticks\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: but see what you find\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki\\
Leaving in 5ish\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Home and the glasses were in the lake bag :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That was easy then.\\
Now, quick. Sleep fast\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was nice spending more time together today. Just us.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, I really enjoyed it too. More please :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: All tucked in. Thank you for tonight :relieved-face:\\
Night night x x x x x x\\Sleep well.\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thank you as well.\\

\section*{Sunday $21\textsuperscript{st}$}
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning (is it?) x x x x x x x x x\\
We decided not to go because they're still not sure of the route etc. back to bed I go :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00021282-GIF-2024-07-21-08-30-18.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How did you sleep?\\
We decided straight at 3 but it took me absolute ages to fall back asleep and then it was very fitful.\\Actually, they posted 2 hours ago that they are going to cancel because of the wind. Good thing we didn't go\\Would you like me to come cheer you on?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Slept ok, woke up a few times but that’s it.\\
Oh that’s good in the end but a pain it disrupted your sleep.\\That’s entirely up to you. It’s not exactly a big event and it’s only 5km.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I can come. Will be good to get out :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok :smiling-face-with-hearts:. There might be some other ypom people around.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m aiming to get there for 10:30\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Coolio. I'll try to park at Lidl\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Do you want me to pick you up or would you rather do you own thing? I’m going to get the lido first\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll do my own :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just keep your phone with you around 10.30 so I can find you x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Will do\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Parked in Lidl and just walking over\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Same\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ran into Chris Chaplin running as I walked back :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Of course he is out for a run :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hmm, fun when you take the shoe off and the sock has blood on it!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no. What did you hurt?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not actually taken the sick of yet, suspect it the funny toe from a couple of events ago\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sock\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh make sure you disinfect it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, will do.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Do you have snacks for race?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep, probably too many :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: But will see me through to pizza later\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was vroom vroom?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Katie is getting to the lake for 7.30. shall we go earlier? Pick you up at 7.10?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah we can go earlier.\\
Vroom Vroom was ok. A bit interesting but a lot of crying over the radio from a lot of drivers\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: how was the nap? Have you been up to much?\\
I might have figured out some mouse stuff or at least worked around it\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It was okay but I did wake up with a headache.\\
I've been pottering, cooking and prepping stuff for the week.\\I'll bring you some of the Mac and cheese?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well done on the mouse! I knew you'd figure something out\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You can bring some mac and cheese if you have spare. I have lunch tomorrow but can always have it for Tuesday. I'll bring a cool box for drinks\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I definitely have spare :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: pasta for the whole street then\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, I have two portions for you (well your 1 portion)\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just leaving\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Home :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done.\\
That was fun. Enjoyed myself.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Me too :smiling-face: just pottering to bed\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just having a quick sit and will be doing the same.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't rest your eyes :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Should be fine. I’ve not had booze\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: My phone is in sleep mode so I’ll wish you good night x x x x x x x x x x x\\
Hope you sleep ok.\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night x x x x x x x x x x x\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x\\
That's probably sensible. You still have Hannah anyway.\\Haha yeah, they go on for quite a while.\\I slept some, woke up a couple of times as usual\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hopefully you have a chilled ish day in the office.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Only like 7 meetings :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: 7 chances for a nap :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not in the office\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Why is it sad panda?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: She was just acting sad. I think she is \/ was knackered. She hadn’t slept until I picked her up. She is currently asleep on the sofa.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Awww puppy\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What are you up to?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sat on the sofa with the dog :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Somehow watching a video about a speedboat\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah of course\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Enjoy your chilled day\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How many more meetings to go?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 3 or 4. Can't remember.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Got a bloody headache too\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Boo, more water.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am drinking\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And less meetings :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ideally\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've got a lot of work to get on with\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Do you have a chill evening?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes nothing planned\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The only one this week it seems\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You out Friday then?\\
Tomorrow and Wednesday could be chill ish.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah housewarming at Nicky's on Friday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh nice.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: At least you’re having one free evening. That’s an improvement over the last few weeks.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It is . Right onto next meeting\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00021356-GIF-2024-07-22-12-03-43.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It is progress. It's just because unis barely function July\/August. Hopefully they won't drag their feet for much longer\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sleepy girl\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you made it home yet?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Why do children have to solely communicate through screeching?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I went home just before 4 to work from here because the lights were making my headache unbearable\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was raptor babysitting?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Because of bad parenting . Where were screaming children?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Outside my flat :face-with-rolling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: She was pretty good. A bit of a pain in the garden but at least I got some gardening done. She would either be getting stuck, digging, in the way, in the house or zoomies or stick chewing. 2 of which are fine.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh, I nailed it. Bad parenting\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aw, can we babysit together sometime?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The raptor? I’m sure we can.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes. Not the kids\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just checking :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Apparently the uni results are in for our exams. So will check them later.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oooooooh\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Let me know please\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What's your plan tonight?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: About to clean some of the kitchen and have dinner and then some games.\\
What about you?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What's for dinner?\\
I'm just pottering, nothing much planned tbh\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think it’s chilli. Your Mac and cheese will be lunch tomorrow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm having it for dinner\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: An evening of nothing is probably what you need.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I do feel like it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Guess what\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Bloody washing machine has leaked again\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh No! That’s not what you need.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Can you run it into the sink again to see if that drains ok\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just doing that\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: On a rinse?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m guessing the pipe overflowed rather than the pipe falling out?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup same again\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Very strange\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't know what's with the plumbing\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't put anything weird down the sink\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Cat hair :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha no\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Could it be the flat up or down from me?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Could be a very slight build up of something and it’s just enough to make it over flow\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The main waste pipe should be huge. Otherwise down stairs would just flood\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to put drain cleaner down after this finishes\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Then flush it with boiling water\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Of course\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just really didn't need it today\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I don’t even know what the thing would be but need something to snake down the pipe to clean it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Drain snake?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Maybe but you’d want something that will touch all the sides of the pipe.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Is it a plumber thing?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Maybe, I have no idea.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: As in do I need to call someone out?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, that might be the best thing to do.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: They might have a different solution as well.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How about your one?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Dave. Would be a starting point. Just don’t know what he might recommend\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Could you ask him?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah I can ask him\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've done things. Just doing a trial run :grimacing-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: good luck. It seemed to fix it last time.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well, I passed both my modules. 61\% on Astrophysics and 67\% on cosmology. Would have liked more on the Astrophysics but I suspect the exam score is pretty low. Dont have access to any exam info yet\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That is amazing!!!! Well done. So proud of you. They were both super hard exams and you've worked so hard :red-heart:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: <attached: 00021422-GIF-2024-07-22-20-23-37.mp4>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thank you.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you happy with the results?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not overly. I would have liked more on the astrophysics one. It’s all a huge amount of work to not get 70\% on.\\
But they are passes and the score doesn’t matter for what I’m doing next.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: There you go. I know we are our own worst critic but you have done really well. Judging by what you told me about the exams, it's amazing anyone passed.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, some people seemed to do well. Someone got 75\% and didn’t finish the exam which doesn’t make sense and some people barely passed.\\
How’s the washing machine?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think it's fixed for the moment. I ran through a lot and it didn't leak\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your evening been?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s good. Must be some slow build up of something over time.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s been ok. Games have started poorly and got slightly better. I’m not playing at my best.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope you win some.\\
I'm in bed now. Are you doing spin tomorrow?\\Night night x x x x x x x x x\\Sleep well.\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah going for spin tomorrow :loudly-crying-face:\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x\\
Not had a good night at all, loads of waking up.\\How did you sleep?\\Hope spin is good! Yeah, do you still fancy going?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Slept ok but was up a bit as well.\\
It could be fun wasn’t thinking of staying too long. Not sure if I should eat first or not. I could pick you up?\\Is Katie going?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah it could be nice.\\
Are you going to run\/jeff? If not I'd eat beforehand.\\A lift would be nice. Not sure about Katie. I'll text her later\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: \url{https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGennWeFj/}\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not going to run. My legs really haven’t recovered.\\
What time do you recon as I think some people are running. Pick you up at 6:15?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Do you have any bug spray\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Crappy Barbra :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah that sounds good for a pick up :smiling-face:\\
How was spin?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No I don't\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Spin was a medium disappointment.\\
I have a memory of having bug spray. Will see if I can find it.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Medium disappointment? :face-with-tears-of-joy: Tell me more\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s just a bit of a shit class but there were 4 of us so that helps and a little bit of fun was had. So while I expected disappointment it wasn’t super high :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah fair enough\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What are you up to today?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just about to get moving. Going to build out a bigger maze to test the mouse and I need to print a couple of new walls to take with me for some future testing.\\
Then will see what software changes I might need to make.\\I had a thought on how I could recreate the big I saw, so want to see if I can make it happen. There is some paper work stuff for the weekend I need to check and get done as well.\\What does your day look like?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Busy day for you. Hope the bigger maze works out.\\
In and out of meetings today again but nothing mental\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: hopefully its an easy day for you.\\
Just checking my travel for Friday. I'm on the 10:05 train but need to pick up my tickets first. Maybe a 9:30 pickup?\\Then on Monday I should be at Wycombe station for 15:40\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I can definitely pick you for both of those :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thank you :red-heart::red-heart:\\
Mac and cheese was very good btw :red-heart:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I'm glad you liked it. Not too veggie?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s was right on the limit of veggie. The spinach was ok but there is something else in there :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Spring onions?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I knew it!!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But they are like super cooked down\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: They did cook down\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully it wasn't too bad :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Do I need to bring something with me?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Drink? I'm going to bring my cool box with some stuff for the both of us. Not sure about food and I haven't been hungry for dinner but might try and eat it now.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. I haven't eaten yet and won't have time to cook anything now so will eat after I guess\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: hangry time :face-with-tears-of-joy: but i wasn;t planning on staying super late anyway\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: you have loads of snacks in your place though\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I did not find bug spray\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am trying not to snack\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We will be eaten\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: very good plan\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: hopefully someone else might have some spray\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've been quite good. Or at least more mindful.\\
Also I found a discount code for nutracheck so got it for £26 for the year\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: what is nutracheck\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: OH the app\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes\\

Have you eaten?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I didn't end up being super hungry so I had a protein yoghurt\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Chris is coming tomorrow so you'll have company\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: At least that’s dinner for tomorrow sorted then.\\
Oh that will be interesting. Fun meeting new people. Have you met him before?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not properly. Just like briefly when I ran into them\\

Did you sleep okay?\\I was already in full swing of meetings\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah slept ok, just slow waking up. I thought you’d be well into the day. Hope it goes ok and you get to enjoy canteen lunch.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I hope it's nice too :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Robot day today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep, that’s the plan. Just making up some new posts so I can get the bigger maze running.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope it all works\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: We will see. I thought I had loads of bits to make up a maze. I don’t :loudly-crying-face:. I really should choose easier hobbies :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah, but you like this one\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I really do mainly because it’s very hard but there are soo many elements.\\
Getting there though.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sending mouse working vibes\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thanks, Just got the maze finished so finanly able to run the mouse.\\
Hope work is going ok. Not long left now\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did it run alright?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It does now. It had a bit of a fit for some reason but it now runs. Which is brilliant <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Wooo hooo\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: <attached: 00021504-GIF-2024-07-24-16-41-04.mp4>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thanks, Now just need to see if it will work over the weekend. Got to resit the temptation to update stuff. Got to stick with the plan to get course complete first. No point trying to go fast if it doesn't finish.\\
What are the timings for tonight? Do you want me to drive?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, don't touch it anymore!\\
I'll leave mine at 5.30 and come get you?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok, sounds good.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just leaving\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you managed to hunt dinner?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I have. I had a sausage egg roll. What did you have?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh well done.\\
Turns out I defrosted chilli not chicken. Chicken is tomorrow\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not a bad timetable but only one morning spin class. Just need buzz to pay people to do spin classes or titans to do it.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah that would be ideal\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Snap doesn't do morning ones either\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Really, I thought they did some 9:30 ones. Snap is really too far away. Lots of traffic lights to get through.\\
So buzz has to sorts it self out. Titans would be the easiest but don’t know where they would do it or it will be the lido or Wycombe.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah it's really weird that no gyms around here do spin properly\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It is very strange. The buzz ones were so good at the beginning\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully they'll get someone good soon\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm in bed finally\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done. Was another busy day for you.\\
Night night x x x x x x x x x\\Hope the swim helps you sleep.\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It was. Need some not busy days.\\

Night night x x x x x x x x x\\Sleep well\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00021524-GIF-2024-07-25-06-22-39.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x\\
I slept some, a few big wake-ups :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\Yeah I'm looking forward to just working from home and getting on with bits even though I have million meetings\\Hope the session is good! Come back whole please\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll try to stay whole.\\
Don’t forget that the meetings are also the work.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes yes :smiling-face:\\
Enjoy!\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m still alive but got absolutely beast’d. sweat everywhere.\\
Hope the meetings go well.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: She's making sure you're weekend goes well :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
What did you do?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Circuit stuff, with RUNNING. Have gone up a weight on the hamstring machine. So that’s nice.\\
Gym was dead though.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh well done! That sounds like a killer sesh.\\
What's the plan for the morning? Are you straight off to parentals after shower?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is the plan. Then get my hair cut and buy lunch for tomorrow. Pack, some house job and then need group at 7:30. Hopefully some time for something else. Will see\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Busy day for you. Don't over do it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is the plan for most days. To not overdo it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Also, you too :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Look at youuuu:smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also, very late lunch for you. How are parents?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Parents are good. Just still lots of stuff going on with Nan. Sooo much paperwork and lack of help from the council. She is going to be moved as she doesn’t need nursing care and just needs care. So that saves £500 a week and moves her to a place she has heard of so she thinks she is closer to home.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that's good news. Where is she being moved?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: A care home in Farnham common.  There is some faff about moving her and when she can move. Which will be in a few weeks time.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How’s the day gone?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But hopefully she'll settle there better\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I haven't done much :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Steph's hub is going to come on Monday now so I will have a home evening :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So you’ve done all your meeting like your meant to is what you meant to say.\\
That’s good. You can have an actual rest this evening then.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yea, but not much in-between and took a 2 hour lunch to nap\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm feeling super fatigued today\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00021549-GIF-2024-07-25-15-29-49.mp4>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done on the nap. Much needed I imagine\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh and my mum still hasn’t worked out the Costco stuff yet\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah. Don't call me out like this :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Very much. Couldn't wake up\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I would like to give her money please :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Is she going to work it out when I take it out of my car boot?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well… you paired from the other day was really good. You essentially said that if you did a little bit less your actually be able to do more overall.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You and your logic :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Probably :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Just not been high on her list with holiday and epic Nan paperwork\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Of course. Completely understand.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That pesky logic. It’s sneaks out of know where and gets you right in the face\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: One more meeting\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Woo hoo. Then you’re done.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Actually.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It will be 5. End of day.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Am I getting you at 9.30 tomorrow?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yes please\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Unless you need me to take a taxi\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Brill brill. Already blocked out my diary\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just checking that the thing with Bev on Sat Aug 10th isn't something im going to? Just checking stuff in the calendar\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sorry I completely forgot to tell you that we changed it. We'll just do a spa day :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: ok, not a problem.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We'll do a double date when Nick's not working\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oooo, I was going to look at that. Yes we can do that. Might be late for you.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm not sure they'll be showing it by the time we have a weekend together\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Probably not. They only seem to have films on for a week now.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Dinner there as well or eat before?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hm what do you fancy?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Is your dad going to come with?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I can find the calories but not the price of food.\\
I’ll ask dad\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: a4ea9c5b5dcde8a4a256d68353dfdd62.pdf • 2 pages <attached: 00021582-a4ea9c5b5dcde8a4a256d68353dfdd62.pdf>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not as stupid pricing as I thought it might me.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No they are quite "normal"\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Up to you. We can call it on Tuesday if you like.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We might have to book though. I'd like to go :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well we can book the tickets\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yay :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Will just wait to see what dad says\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki no worries\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s a no from dad so just us. Let’s do food as well.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah that's a shame.\\
But yay for food too :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your evening been?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s ok. Only 4 of us at nerd group. Think I’ve packed. So should be set for tomorrow.\\
How’s your been?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly I haven't gotten up to much.\\
Hope you're having a good time even if it's a small group tonight\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm in bed so will say night night now x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
Hope you sleep well.\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\See you in the morning\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Given your plan was to do nothing sounds like sucess,\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: On the train :train:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Woop woop. Have a good journey :smiling-face:\\
Keep me updated :red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ve managed to get half a carriage to myself. Now to perfect the “fuck off” stare when the train stops. So I keep it that way :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I failed, people are here.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh noooo :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You need to work on your resting bitch face :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope the journey is not too bad though\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I was caught off guard as I was writing. When did trains get so bumpy.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: When weren't they?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Maybe I’m just used to the crap tubes but I thought normal trains were smooth. Not so.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No not really\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What are you up to on the train?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You see people working on the train. I don’t know how with all the bumping about.\\
Just sitting. Listen to an audio book\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nice. What are you listening to?\\

Just started and not really sure what happening yet.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh sounds alright. Hope it's interesting\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: On the second train it’s packed.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no. Do you have a seat?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah it’s allocated seating. Maybe should have risked further down the train.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope it's not too bad\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m hoping it will thin out.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have arrived at the hotel. Room is nicer than expected. Not sure I’ll use the kitchen :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yay! Good time as well. How was the journey?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was ok. No delay so that’s nice and ok after the first stop from Birmingham as got 2 seats. All a bit hot now. Just about to find my way to the convention centre and see how much work there is.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How’s your day gone?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah nice. Cold shower might help\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's been quiet. Did most of my training this morning, had a nap and now onto some admin work\\

Sounds like a much needed easier day for you\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, I just feel I should be doing more\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Why? Has someone told you that you should?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No\\
Just my brain\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Back at the hotel now. Just going to get some food and then can crash for the night. 6:30am start tomorrow :loudly-crying-face:\\
Enjoy your girls evening.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was the convention centre? Loads of work?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s bigger than I thought (not what she said:rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:)\\
The guys had done quite a bit already but lots of fiddly little bits to do bits it done. I’m glad when we pack down on Sunday we don’t have to deal with the walls and carpet etc.\\hopefully it will be busy but will be nice to run the competition anyway.\\The hotel room is soo nice. It’s better than some 1 bed flats I’ve seen. Unexpected (and useless for me) fold out sofa bed as well. Super cute little kitchen.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that is cute :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Glad it's not crappy and you might get good night's sleep.\\
Where are you off for food?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Absolutely no idea on food we are going hunting.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully you'll find something nice\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: We are right in the centre so should be loads\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Enjoy :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Back at the hotel. Need a shower but good day.\\

Sounds like you're having a good day :smiling-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: There was someone dressed as a blue worm.\\

And not much past that\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sounds like a good day.\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll definitely be needing a nap\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good luck with the nap. I am knackered. I’m just about done with people for the moment.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I had a little one.\\
I bet. You'll be locked in your house for 2 days trying to decompress.\\When does it close today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Show finishes at 5 then we pack up. Maybe out by 7\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh sending strength\\
How was today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Today has been ok. Good to do some more mouse tests but it’s tiring talking. Still good just long days. I might be a hermit for dinner\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's a lot of being outgoing and socialising. Hope pack up goes fast so you can have a quiet dinner\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Pack up went quite well. Having a quick beer and then going to be super lazy and get mc Donald’s and collapse in the hotel room.\\
How has your day been?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sounds like a plan! Glad you're finished now. Feels like a successful weekend?\\
It's been nice but I am tired :sleeping-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah it does feel like a successful weekend and everyone is really nice and interesting. Quite an expensive weekend really but good. You never know what might come of these things.\\
Did your nap not help out much?\\You need to remember what you said in paired during the week…. About doing less so you can do more.\\Do you maybe need to see the doctor again about the lack of sleep you’re getting?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes I bet it all adds up. But I'm glad it's all positive\\
Helped a little bit but I have done a lot these two days.\\I probably should...\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I thought you had a pretty chill day yesterday minus the gym?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: But gym, swim and walk is still a lot in 2 days\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And then I cleaned the whole flat, cooked dinner, tidied up\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh, that is significantly less chill than I thought.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have you eaten?\\

How was your last night.\\I slept some.\\What time does your train leave?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was ok, I was and still am just knackered. More drained I think. Not been that way for a very long time. Think it’s the brain fatigue that was strange.\\
Train is at 11:55. I thought it was 11:05. The arrival time is the same.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You'll need some time to recharge.\\
What is the arrival time again please?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s 3:30ish. It will all depend what train I’m able to get from Marylebone.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. Keep me updated, I should be able to pick you up\\

Weekends like this are never good for food and drinks.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I should have thought about it and booked the quiet carriage\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s got better but was loud at the start\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Couple more hours?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, I think it’s 90 odd minutes are so to London.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Woop\\

I've unpacked the bathroom bits. Really hope it gets done today. And will need to figure out how to take the old bits to the dump\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well I’ll have a skip next week\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ooooooh\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hi. Here are my account details.\\
Name on the account: Paul Busby\\Sort code: 11-12-59\\Account number: 00092832\\So you have it\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It asked if I see myself retiring. I have already.\\
What does it feel like? Busy, all the time busy.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How’s the bathroom going?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I answered it as what it would look like :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good, the screen is almost up and looks very good\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Your answer was good and made sense as you still work.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How are you doing? Did you manage to chill?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just about to have beige dinner :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:. Still got the headache but have chilled.\\
Is the bathroom all done?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not yet, just finishing up. The bath panel proved a bit tricky\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But it looks so much better!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I need to go do a food shop after\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I can imagine that bath panels are a pain.\\
As in food shop today?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah . I've got nothing for tomorrow\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh wow that looks sooo much better\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Guess how much\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: £150\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: £60\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What!!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I asked him twice\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: He said he can come do the tiles too\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Paint them? That would be good\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: He could retile but that would be such a massive job\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is a much bigger job\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have white pain but it probably wouldn’t match\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm thinking going colourful\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: In that case I have 2 shades of white :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Neither of which are bathroom suitable now I think about it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Back home. Aldi was bloody bare\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Late in there day I guess. Did you find enough stuff?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Are we doing anything Wednesday and or Thursday?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've got Steph on Thursday but we can do something on Wednesday. Did you manage to get tickets for tomorrow?\\

I am failing at booking these cinema tickets. I've signed up for their membership thingy but it wont let me login to actually book anything.\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\Will keep trying\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You shouldn't need to sign up for membership. Did you have to pay for that?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: yeah because you then pre pay for 6 tickets which makes it cheaper\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I've contacted them via email as they are shut and got an auto response straight away.\\
Yes I can checkout by quest, which I should have done but thinking about trying to save a bit of money ive done the membership thing and now cannot book with the tickets I have just bought\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okay well hopefully they'll get back to you tomorrow morning :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i'll just phone them in the morning. unnecessary faff\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
It's so so warm\\Do you have Hannah this morning?\\It's going to be from the talking hopefully. You did a lot of it over the weekend. Gargling with salt water helps if you can do it\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah got Hannah at 7.\\
Think it will be a day of watching the Olympics.\\I really hope it’s just from talking.\\Are you in the office today?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully it's not going to be too hot in the gym yet.\\
Enjoy the sesh.\\Yeah. I'll be WFH Thursday and Friday\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Session was good and raptor has been collected. Having a nightmare trying to get it to be calm enough for me to have breakfast.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I bet. She's going to be unsettled today with the heat and lack of walkies. Hose down for both of you :beaming-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hmmm, wet dog smell\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Do you people not wash your dogs? :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not consistently. Only ever washed mine if they had rolled in something. Certainly not a weekly or monthly thing\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Really?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, they don’t need it.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know cats don't but I'd have thought at least once a month for dogs\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Only if they stink from mud or shit they have rolled in.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hmm new info :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What are you up to today?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: She is full fomo about not going outside.\\
Today is just survive. Survive the dog and survive the heat and then our date later. Once Everyman fix their technical issue :man-facepalming:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh did you call them?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The had already replied to my email this morning. I’ll check again in a minute and phone as they said give it 2 hours\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. Hopefully it works\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I really shouldn’t have tried to “save” £5\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha\\
But you can take your dad for a fancy cinema date too\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh yeah. Will easily go 3 times. Just it would have been booked and done already\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Finally got tickets. Phew. Got a sofa as well. Pick you up 6:30?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Also just spent £1k on bricks :loudly-crying-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah well done. Yeah 6.30 should work. Just need to jump in the shower after work.\\
Sofa? For where?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ooof\\
That better be a lot of bricks, not like just 5 super special ones\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sofa, at the cinema\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ooooh :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They only have sofas and arm chairs no?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah but thought it might nice to have a sofa over 2 chairs\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes it will be :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's my spot :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But awwww\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Still good for half past?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: On the way\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you home alright?\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
You made it up! Did you sleep well?\\I hope they're not swimming in the Seine.\\I'm tired. As predicted, no one else is going into the office so will go for like half a day I think\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Slept ok, will try for more tomorrow.\\
Yeah they are in the river. Massive currents as well.\\Take it easy. Was can call the lake later in the day if you like.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ewww, in the river.\\
I'd really like to go for a swim. It will be so nice after this sweaty day. I already need another shower\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Spicy :hot-pepper:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm noooooot :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What time are you meeting dad?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: 11ish. Don’t have a confirmed time yet.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope you have a nice time together :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thanks\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was lunch with dad? And how's nan doing?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Lunch was good\\
But just leaving Nan now. Has taken ages.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Are you back home? What time should I pick you up?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that is a long day. Where did you go for lunch?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes I am.\\
5.30?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Osaka’s for lunch. Was very good.\\
Ok, I’ll pick you up at 5:30x\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. Look forward to seeing you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Me too :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Running a smidge late. Washing machine has finished. Will say when leaving\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Leaving now, I have air bed\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh thank you\\
I wouldn't have remembered\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Home alright?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep, just unpacked and sorting food\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you get glared at?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No not really :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How much protein per 100?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 20g\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh that’s pretty good\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah not bad, and taste quite nice\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope your evening has been better than mine\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh no. What’s happened?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Had to call the police because a weird man with a baseball bat has been pacing the car park next door.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: For two hours\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Load of them turned up now\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: He's really not well\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Weird men or police\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Becci and I were on neighbourhood watch the whole time and then I called because it was scary\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Police\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s not a fun evening as all. At least the police have turned up.\\
Does that mean you can get some rest now or is it all loud?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No. I'm giving running commentary to becci and Amy because scary\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Are they both I the wrong side to see?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Amy is not home so worried for us\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And yes for becci\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's been bloody scary. Rattling his bat on the railings, waiting for someone\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yelling or just being menacing?\\
At least you’re safe inside. It’s never fun when someone is acting odd near you. Really not sure what to say.\\I’d assume now the police have arrived he’ll be carted away\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Menacing and sketchy\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They are trying but he's not responding. They are trying not to escalate\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But there's like 3 police cars\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: At least he is out numbered.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But he just lurked for 2 hours\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And he might love above me because becci caught him on the ring\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Why would he be at the other flats if he lives in your building\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: God knows\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Why was he in our locked building\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Has she got him on the camera with the bat then?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well she didn't know what it was\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh that is scary\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And weird\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The silver car that was there when you dropped me off had it's horn stuck on so I looked out and saw him\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The 2 guys looked like they were trying to sell it. That was the impression I got or one was showing it off to the other.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeh\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not related them two\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Do the police know Becky has video of the guy?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I did say on the call\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No doubt they’ll try and collect that tomorrow then.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They just have him in a big circle trying to get a name out of him\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: He is so not well\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: He's been sick twice\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Drunk or drugs or both plus mentally unwell\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I said all that\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: To the police\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But also said we were very worried he'll know it was us\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Once they get the bat off him my guess would be it will be over quick. Either cell or hospital.\\
How would he know it was you?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: There are loads of flat that can see\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No bat anymore\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Who knows. Paranoia\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I need to know he's been taken away\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I would try not to worry about him knowing who called the police. The police won’t say\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know they won't\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But you know. Love female and all\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: ?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Lone female :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Another police car just rocked up\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, but he also doesn’t know that.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: They are taking there time with it then\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Very frustrating as the police will take him away but I get that you want to know it’s happened. Plus the police might then want to talk\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You should already plan for a late start tomorrow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Already planning that\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did not think my evening was going to go like this\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It wouldn’t be on any top 10 list of guesses\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It was scary to be honest\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: He's just been pacing and watching and all that\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And the bat\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Very unsettling behaviour\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Must be scary\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You can come here if you want but I’m guessing your road is currently blocked with police cars\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It is. I am safe and will be able to go to bed the moment they drive off with him\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Correct you are safe inside. Which is good.\\
They must be close to getting him now. Probably the wrong suggestion but they should just tase and throw in the van.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They are trying to get some info and calm him\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s just so disruptive for the whole street to have 4 police cars all because of one lunatic. If he is unconscious it’s much easier onto move around and restrain\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I thought something must have been going on when you hadn’t told me you were in bed\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah\\
But to be honest they didn't rock up guns blazing. Very much de-escalation\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Which is probably the right approach. Aggression doesn’t de escalate anything\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just time consuming for all\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Maybe that could be my running slogan for chief of police\\
“Tase first, questions later”\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Please don't go into police\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s not one of my plans.\\
Seemed like an interesting idea a while ago but the paper work, hours and all the scum people you deal with. No thanks\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sensible\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m just about to take a quick shower.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How has he still not been taken away yet.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just got him into ambulance\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh nice\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That gets him taken to stoke or Wexham then\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It was obvious he wasn't well\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Wycombe don’t take ambulances\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: He wasn't aggressive with them or anything\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I guess that’s good. Maybe very confused and scared himself\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think so\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Bed time now?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, soon. Just debriefing :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: With the police?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No with the neighbours :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Everyone gone now. Bed ti\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s good.\\
I’m sorry you’ve had a late and scary evening.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's alright now. They responded very quickly tbh\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m glad. You’d hope so for something like that\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you for staying up with me :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x\\
I'm shattered. How did you sleep?\\What are you up to today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Get that napped booked in.\\
Slept ok but I stayed up too late.\\I’m not sure today. It’s the first day in a week I haven’t had something booked either morning or evening. I’d like it to be cooler. I think this sore throat is turning into a cold or the swim did something as I’m sneezing a lot.\\So I’ve no idea what I’ll do today. Will find something.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think you should have a rest day.\\
Do you need anything for the throat? Have you gargled or had the honey?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think that is what I’ll do. I’ll add some stuff to the shopping for tomorrow and get a spray.\\
I have had honey.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Get some lemons in too.\\
I've put an out of office on for an hour and will have a quick nap. I'm feeling so rotten\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Late night and candle burning has wiped you out\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m guessing your nap has been longer than expected?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ooooh stuff\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, I really struggled getting up. But I am now!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your morning been?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: blinked and missed it somehow. Just been sorting some feedback from the weekend and now about to have lunch. I was hoping the skip would have arrived but no sign of it yet.\\
How are you doing? Any options for a second nap?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope you're not overdoing things. How's the throat?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i rarely overdo things. throat is still there, just a background irritation really with the odd cough. Could well do without as i dont want to give it to anyone else.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done on the second nap. Full CAT day.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just had a hour's meeting and have another one at 2.30 so trying to squeeze it in\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Has the skip arrived?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: yep, its all here now. He is going to start on Saturday so should be an exciting mess to come back to on Sunday.\\
What time is your session?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh is he? Do you need anyone popping in on him?\\
It's at 5.30. I am so not well today\\How has your day been?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thanks but he should be ok. I need to leave power out for him but that's about it. I assume he is going to start with taking stuff apart. You can do a sneaky drive by if you want to see :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
:crying-face: late night and the stress of it will have no doubt tipped you over the edge. You have been pushing it for a number of weeks now plus its stupid hot again.\\I'm not really sure. Just been playing a demo i found the other week. Having a chill day really. To hot to have done any of the work i wanted.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: got a response from Liverpool. 5.5 weeks after sending the email.\\
I am enrolled and should be getting further instructions "in the upcoming weeks"\\A truly pathetic level of organisation\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, I might :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Yeah, I haven't been very good on myself and the heat is killing me. I've had a fan on me all day and makes no difference.\\I'm glad you had a nice chilled day. What's for dinner?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yay! That's good news. Well done.\\
And tbh pretty standard academia response over the summer :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Steph's taking photos and measurements :loudly-crying-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh bugger i bet Hannah will want photo's tomorrow as well.\\
You have nothing to worry about.\\… So you need to bet better at being good on yourself... Like your paired response from last week\\Dinner is chicken something I have defrosted. Last time i got it wrong so i have no idea until i go to re heat\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm so bloated. And obviously with the new scale numbers :confused-face:\\
I do. I know\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I can hear thunder :grinning-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: If anything these could be your new "before" pictures\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh noooo. I'm really hoping it's better than in October\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: proper thunder now\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That would be uncomfortable\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: We could use a more comfortable chair.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You survived the gym then?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No. She killed me. I felt so so weak today. Proper struggled with my "every day" weights\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Some days are like that. At least you still went and got it done.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: She put me on a 16 week strength programme for powerlifting\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oooo :flexed-biceps::flexed-biceps:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It like calculates your \% of 1rm and progressively overloads with a reload week\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I don’t see yoga on that timetable\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: But that is what Hannah wanted to do\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that's the wrong one :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's from Steph yesterday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: This makes no sense to me at all. Why is week 1 heavier than week 4\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Week 4 is deload week\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s the same picture btw.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know but the text explains\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh ok. So 3 sessions a week\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No, just like spreading it through my workouts. So if I'm doing upper body, the bench and press, if I'm doing legs the deadlift and squats\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But yea, 3 sessions a week :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Sorry my brain is absolute mush\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I had already guessed that :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What are you up to tonight?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just finishing off dinner. Need to put the car back on the drive and then maybe games with Matt.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What are you up to?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sounds like a good evening. I'm glad you've had a nice chilled day.\\
I've just had some pasta for dinner and will take a shower. That's as far as I got\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That sounds like the evening you need. A quiet one.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes I really do. I know I keep saying it but I really haven't felt this shit for ages\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm sorry we haven't spent alone time this week\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It definitely was last night that tipped you over. It definitely poor or lack of sleep and stress that are the biggest flare triggers and you had a double dose yesterday while already teetering. Then the added heat just stacks on top. Maybe it’s good that our holiday is October. Low 20’s should be much better.\\
I’m sorry you’re feeling worse. I’m not sure you have long enough before Saturday to catch up and I’m guessing Saturday night won’t help at all. That air bed will be very soft.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s not exactly your fault. It won’t surprise you to know that I’d already worked out we probably wouldn’t be alone this week. An outside chance on Wednesday but if didn’t swim it was still going to be mega hot.\\
We can try again next weekend.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh you are absolutely right. Maybe my body is also getting used to not being on summer holidays\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think you’re just getting used to a consistent thing instead of the roller coaster nightmare of teaching.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We'll definitely try next week. I've got bookclub on Tuesday but not much else planned\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok. I’ve got a funeral Tuesday and I’m out at nerd group Wednesday evening. Otherwise   Nothing planned\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Funeral?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How have you not mentioned a funeral?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have. It’s for one of my artists friends Georgina. Her husband Robin had some cancer\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No you haven't bubs.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know Heidi and other friends husbands weren't well but I didn't know they passed.\\
I'm sorry\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sorry I thought I had told you.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's okay. I was just surprised. Hope you're friend is doing as well as possible in this situation\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's Becky doing?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was expected and apparently peaceful but no doubt still very bad. He was only 70 something.\\
I don’t think Becky is doing very well. She has the kids this week and has been sick, no doubt from over extending herself. Her Dad is still alive\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Is there anything we can do for Becky?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have no idea. I don’t think so. I should be seeing her next Wednesday morning.\\
She is just a bit stuck in limbo as her Dad won’t get better but he is still alive.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Maybe we could take her out to dinner? Just for a change of scenery and thoughts?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good idea. I will ask but she is super busy. Wednesday morning is all she had :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Understandable. But could be nice if she has time\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Took me ages to get to bed. Are you all packed for the weekend?\\
Night night x x x x x x x x hope you sleep well.\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Haven’t even started packing. Got time in the morning.\\

She got a call that she needed to get there. Apparently the whole family were there at the end.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh god I am so sorry. But I'm glad that she got to be there and say her goodbyes. Please send my love to her\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Will do.\\
I’ll see about dinner with her next week. Are you about Thursday and or Friday?\\I know she will be trying to see her boyfriend as well.\\How was the walk?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. I'm around both Thursday and Friday. But I realised I have Liddy on Monday.\\
When are you leaving?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: We might not see each other until Thursday then unless Sunday.\\
Liddy will be good for you.\\Not sure yet. Some time after 12 I think. Might have an early lunch and then get going.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know :loudly-crying-face:\\
Dee doesn't leave until Monday but maybe we could do dinner on Sunday if you'd feel up for it?\\How long is the drive across?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I thought she was leaving on Sunday. Yeah we could do dinner but I don’t want to be in the way. Not sure what time I’ll be home but likely to be mid afternoon.\\
Should be a 3-4hour drive.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Monday morning.\\
I'll check with her but we'll have to eat :woman-shrugging-light-skin-tone:\\How was your session this morning?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was good. Sumo’s and the curse sort of came back. Up to 180kg. Went for 6 but managed 4 due to sweat and then going for the second set something felt off in a butt muscle so we did other stuff as well.\\
I used those weird machine up stairs by the mats. They are super easy for me other than trying to get in the things.\\Gym was an absolute sweat box. You could almost taste the air.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 180 is still loads. This heat is definitely not helping in the gym.\\
How's the butt feeling?\\Oh the abduction ones? They are so hard to get into\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: The butt is fine. Just felt that something might go wrong if I did the lift again.\\
That’s the ones. Like a terrible theme park ride to get into.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's sensible then that you didn't\\
Haha yes, very good description.\\Please let me know before you set off\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just about to hit the road. Will let you know when I stop and arrive\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have a safe journey :red-heart::red-heart:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just stopped for a coffee and food\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nice. How's the journey so far?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s ok. Could be a bit better. Had a 20 min delay. I think my gym session kicked in as I got in the car. Coffee and food should sort.\\
How’s your day going? Nearly done?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I hope you're not too sore this weekend.\\
I've done the absolute bare minimum today, struggling\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Tiredness not soreness.\\
Oh being the good corporate girly then. It is hot and Friday.\\Work can always be done on Monday.\\What time does Dee arrive tomorrow?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well hope you're not too tired this weekend.\\
I did have a nap though. There's a couple of bits I've got to finish before the weekend but that's it\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: She's landing just before 11 so should be with me by 12\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: There is a half hour delay before the bridge :man-facepalming:\\
Maybe I should have looked at the train.\\Well if you blast through those couple of bits your done done for the day.\\Nice lazy start for you tomorrow then. Have you got to pick her up?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no. Hope it moves quickly. It's Friday :pensive-face:\\
Yup, that's the plan\\Only got to pick her up from handy cross :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: How dare you move.\\
I’ve arrived.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Woo hoo. Was it alright?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Say hello to Rich and Kate even though I don't know them\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I mean I’ve made it. I have no idea how long it’s taken but well over 4 hours\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah it definitely has\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh hello gorgeous\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I won't tell Spud though\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You could tell him how nice snickers is. He could learn. :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Everytime I’m around children I am more and more pleased about have that vasectomy\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Spud is lovely :smiling-cat-with-heart-eyes: don't be mean to him\\
Oh yes, you're spending the weekend with kids :grimacing-face:\\What are you up to tonight?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Snickers just bit me so I’ll let spud off. :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
I think we are getting a takeaway but currently bed time is being attempted. There are tears and screaming. I have escaped with the cat.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah, you see!\\
Oh nice! Enjoy the evening.\\I'm just going to hoover and take a shower. I had two naps again today :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done. If you need the naps then take the naps. Pushing through isn’t going to make you feel better and you’re going to have a busy weekend.\\
Is Dee sleeping on the inflatable or you?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It will be me\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, your going to be broken then <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :grimacing-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I might be quite soft although you can blow it up quite hard. Just will be different from your bed\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully I'll blow it up enough\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What take away are you having?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just waiting for our Indian\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yum. What did you order?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Lamb passanda, rice, naan\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oooooh nice. Love a passanda\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was very good. Have you not made it to bed yet?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I just got in now.\\
Hope you're having a good evening.\\Night night x x x x x x x x x x x\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, only one mild domestic, always funny with couples that have been together a long time.\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x\\
Not really, just woke up myself but have a few hours.\\Oh no :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: are you feeling a bit fragile?Did you have a good night though?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Only a little fragile. It’s all Rich’s fault :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Was good fun though. Now to see what happening the rest of the day.\\You’ve got time to get stuff ready this morning without going mad.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm sure :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Let me know what you get up to. Hope it's a good day.\\I just need to change the bed tbh and then sort myself out\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well, breakfast was a whole thing.\\
I really don’t understand how now it seems that children just won’t eat their food and constantly more around at the table.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Awww.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What are you getting up to?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: We are at some park garden thing.\\
The children are a nightmare.\\Always talking and interrupting then screaming or crying.\\Have you sorted out your plans for food tonight?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh joy. How old are they?\\
Yup, we're just on the way to London to see a play and will have dinner there.\\What are you having tonight?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh wow, I thought you were going to a spa. What show are you seeing?\\
5 and 3 :man-facepalming:\\I think it’s a BBQ tonight.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No, that's Bev. But I still need to book it\\
That is a Lot of energy. Sending strength.\\Are you staying in or going out?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Staying in. Very much in.\\
Have fun in London.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha. You're saying that very seriously. Were you not planning to go out?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Weren’t planning on out and it’s calmer to stay in.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I thought you said you usually have a takeout the first night and then eat out.\\
But yes. And I guess they don't need to get a sitter.\\Btw, Dee is up for dinner tomorrow\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s normally been takeout and cooking. Certainly since the children. Going out with the children would just be miserable for everyone.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok, any thoughts are to where we’d have dinner tomorrow?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's very true. How's the weather?\\
I'm not sure, any suggestions? Maybe Turkish?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Weathers ok. Rain yesterday but today has been nice. Just cloudy.\\
I’d thought Turkish as well.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Found what you need\\
\url{https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20140321-orgasms-at-the-push-of-a-button}\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We've just eaten a gorgeous carbonara that came in a big ass wheel of cheese :drooling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll have to read that at home.\\
Hope you're having a nice evening\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh nice. Off to the show now? Which is?\\
It’s a long article that’s a bit funny but they are starting to do spinal stimulation stuff. So something to keep an eye.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll have a read when I'm home.\\
Have you had the BBQ yet?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: NOPE. The children are still awake. Adulting can’t happen while children are awake.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh boo. Hope it's soon\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: If starting to work out that the next 5 years are going to be the hardest in terms of seeing and talking to my friends. Need all the children to be at least 8 or older for some logic to start winning.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Cannot even guess what that is about but hope it’s good and the seats aren’t tooo painful.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah, unfortunately it seems like that. But they will try to make time, it will just need a little juggling\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's an Agatha Christie who dunnit play\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was BBQ?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was good. Due to weather we just used the grill but good fun.\\
Are you on your way home yet?\\I’ve just made it to bed. Rich was falling asleep in the chair. Expected, as he’d only had 4 hours sleep.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s what she said :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s a double\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I knew you were going to say that\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's not because my sheet doesn't fit :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It will. Deflate a little to put the sheet in and then blow up\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You have to say when you get the set up\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Also if it’s fits it’s not too big\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just about\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did you have a good evening?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah really nice. So good when the children just aren’t there to interrupt. It would be fine if they would do their own thing but every 5th sentence they ask something or misbehave.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you had a good evening?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah they are really too little to be that independent. A few more years.\\
Yeah we had a really lovely evening. Just a late one\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I glad you’ve had a good time.\\
I hope you sleep ok in the air mattress\\Night night x x x x x x x x x x x x\\Love You :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just got into air bed.

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x\\
I slept some\\How are you this morning?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Some doesn’t sound like a lot.\\
I’m ok. Bit of a headache. Just starting to get moving. I already hear tears.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Two heavy ish nights in a row - I bet.\\
When will you be setting off?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, been a while since I’ve drunk that much over 2 nights.\\
Not sure yet. One of them should have gone swimming for an hour. Suspect I’ll be on the road in an hour or two.\\What are your plans for the day?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just make sure you're okay to drive, it's a long one\\
We're slowly getting up, will have breakfast and then go for a potter in Marlow then we'll see and then dinner?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll be absolutely fine for the drive and will let you know once it about to leave and home. Can call dinner once I’m home but should be ok.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just leaving now.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have a safe journey :red-heart:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Home\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh well done\\
How was the drive?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was pretty good. Currently knackered.\\
How’s Marlow?\\Any thoughts on timings for dinner? If dinner is still on.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I bet. Marlow was good. We did a big walk. Just at spade Oak for lunch.\\
Shall we do 7 for dinner? Or earlier?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: A bit earlier might be better. 6:30?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We're just ordering lunch. But okay\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Can do 7 then if that’s better\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've booked for 6.45?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's the wall looking?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok.\\
The skip is half full!\\He’s taken apart all of the damaged stuff. So looks odd but good at the same time.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah I'm glad. Is he coming back tomorrow?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Pretty sure. He should be here all week. I suspect the destruction is real quick and now it’s all time consuming to rebuild everything.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I guess I’ll meet you at olive tree?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It will look good!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes please :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Great. See you later.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We're just having a drink in merletto\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Shall I meet you there or at the olive tree?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: If you're early then meet us here :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you for coming to dinner with us :red-heart:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Your welcome. That was fun.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm glad you had a good time with us. Dee is literally my oldest friend here\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Believe it or not I do actually like spending time with you and your friends\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Very unimpressed with the lack of dirt or embarrassing stories. Next time …\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know you do :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: and I love that\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
Yes I dropped her off at just after 5.\\How was spin?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you manage an extra nap?\\
How are you feeling? Busy weekend with a lot of crap sleep I’m guessing\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Spin was really good. So good that Tam is back.\\
Nearly only 2 of us but 5 in the end.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I managed another hour but definitely will be having another one at lunch.\\
I'm not feeling the greatest but will take it easy\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You office today?\\
Is it book club you have tomorrow?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I'm glad that you finally had a good class. How broken are you feeling?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I thought the throat \/ cold would kill me which it nearly did but the legs are ruined. Less broken than I thought.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm WFH today\\
And yes, book club tomorrow :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That throat is really lingering. Are you taking anything?\\
What are you up to today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s only been a week and felt better this morning. I got some throat stuff with my shopping that is helping and I think keeping the talking down helps.\\
Not sure. Might sort out a couple of bits in the garden and make some attempt on the spare room. Just try to get some of the house jobs done.\\The guys are here doing the walls.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: A week is a long time. Glad the throat stuff is helping.\\
Sounds like a productive day :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It is but does seem like a cold takes 10 days or so.\\
As long as I don’t have the 100 days nonsense that some people have had.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Also what do you think to this\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok, will order. See if we can beat the drugs.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I hope we can beat the drugs\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Me too\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you had a lunch nap?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I have :sleeping-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your morning been?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: well done on the nap. I have managed to do some gardening and cooked 4 lunches. A headache has arrived from somewhere. Probably due to it being way to hot outside.\\
About to tackle student loan stuff.\\New sex toy has been ordered.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: its pretty much the same for blue badge as well\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: also what do you want me to request for our holiday plane wise? Is it just boarding early?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You have been very productive. Well done!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't have one but I should be able to request something\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just the early boarding would be nice. I don't want to be wheeled around the airport in assistance chair :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok, I have been able to select generic assistance and it seems I need to call to give details. Also need to phone to talk to them about the hotel as well so we at least get 2 beds. Do you care at all about what floor the room might be on?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: If you can request some official looking paper work that will be good.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you.\\
You could tell them I'll be traveling with a cane but won't need a wheelchair.\\I'm not fussed about what floor we're on, there will be a lift :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: If I can get an appointment :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your afternoon been? Wall looking alright?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Been ok. Bit slow as had a headache. Mark dropped in with the dog and money.\\
Wall looks good. He is coming back on Thursday. Might all be done by Friday. Means I can have a lie in tomorrow.\\How was liddy?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh in sorry you still have a headache. Did you take something? I hope it starts to pass soon\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That looks amazing! And quick.\\
No spin tomorrow?\\Liddy was absolutely brilliant. A lot more hurty than usual but so good\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I got too hot in the garden and hadn’t drunk enough. So just had more water.\\
Spin has disappeared from the timetable so not on tomorrow. Will be nice to get a lie in though.\\Your more hurty or liddy hurt more than normal?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well hopefully it does pass soon. Chug that water\\
Oh okay. Hopefully you'll get a nice lay in.\\Liddy hurt more than normal because I guess I'm more hurty all around?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I guess that would make sense.\\
What are your plans for the rest of the evening?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not much to be honest. Will make my lunch. How about you?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Should be about to play some games but that’s about it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: With Matt?\\
What do you fancy doing on Thursday?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah with Matt.\\
Thursday, I have no idea.\\I mean a straight answer to the question would be. You!\\We did chat last week about maybe having dinner with Becky but I’m not sure if she is free yet. She gets back tomorrow.\\Otherwise I’m not sure food wise.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We could have an evening at home if you'd like?\\
I can make a risotto?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: An evening at home would be good and yes we can have risotto.\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x\\
I was up a few times and in loads of pain today.\\Yup in the office, got a few meetings that I needed to be in f2f\\Did you sleep well? What are you up to today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh I’m sorry :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
What do you think is causing because you’ve been pretty bad for a few weeks now?\\Slept ok and woke up before the alarm.\\Not sure yet on the morning. Got to get moving first. Might clear out the pond. Then have an early ish lunch before the funeral. I do need to check if the service part is open to everyone\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm not sure. I don't know if it's the heat, activity, wind direction or a curse or combination of all. But definitely have felt as getting worse and this morning is just not great.\\
What time and where is the funeral?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Heat won’t help and that has been reducing your sleep\\
I need to check where but the service is at 2pm. It’s pretty local and then there is a “party” (there words) at 3:30.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't usually know what to say when people go to funerals. Hope the service is nice? Or something else?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I never know what I should say either. Hopefully it’s just nice and nothing goes wrong.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What did you decide to do with your morning?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not a huge amount. Sorting out the pond.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How did the pond go? When are you leaving?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The pond is now filled with old broken flower pots. Much better than lugging them to the skip and me pulling bricks out of the skip. Green bin full again.\\
Loads of plant crap in the pond but gone now. Came up with another plan of action with the front garden. I think there is some big stuff I can cut down and get in the skip.\\Just about to start getting ready. Aiming to leave at 1:30. It’s 20 minutes away.\\How’s the day going?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh why old broken pots?\\
You've had been very productive.\\I'm just on my way home. Did my f2f meetings I needed and the last one can be home. Lots of pain\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: They weren’t broken to start with but they are now. They didn’t fit well in the pond and I dropped one and broke a couple. Made them all fit better.\\
Not really. Only an hours work in total. Just a bit blocked with the deadline to go out. Will try again tomorrow on some inside house jobs.\\:smiling-face-with-tear: I’m sorry. Good that you can get home. At least you have an easy evening or is book club outside? A bath maybe?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah okay. Are you going to put something on top? My brain is not cooperative with imagination\\
Oh completely understand that. I wouldn't have been able to do most of that with a deadline.\\It's fortunately a zoom bookclub because otherwise I wouldn't have been able to go\\I don't know where this pain is coming from but it's been a long time since it's been this bad\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Going to get some stones \/ pebbles to go over the top. Just using the pots and bricks to take up the space. So it’s looks like a rock garden in the end. That’s the thought anyway.\\
That’s good on the book club.\\Had to be the weekend tipping you over the edge. Crap sleep the other night with the police then straight into a full on weekend with your friend. Trip to London, mega walk. 2 shit nights sleep on the inflatable and mega early start on the Monday. Plus all the low grade stuff from the week before.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That sounds good.\\
You having a functional brain is so good :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: yes, when you write it down it is all these things that are making me extra poorly.\\Hope this afternoon goes as well as it can given the circumstances. Let me know when you're back\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Maybe this is an extra issue fibro people have. You just don’t remember stuff and are confused “why do I feel worse” :grinning-face:\\
It’s all that annoying logic stuff.\\Service was really good. More emotional than I expected to get. Some great speeches\\A wicker coffin and I’ve not been to a burial before. Party poppys at the end. The theme of one foot in the grave at the start.\\Just at the party but don’t want to be first in as I was one of the first out of the car park.\\Nice little church. Very old and almost impossible to find.\\It was standing room only. Easy 200 people.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh wow, that sounds like a lovely service.\\
Where is it happening?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've had a lay down\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was somewhere near bledlow ridge then the wake was Piddington.\\
Back home now. Just been chatting with neighbours.\\Did the lie down help.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope your friend is okay. It sounds like a lovely send off and celebration of life\\
Have you heard from Becky?\\It's helped a little with the head but not with the pain. I'm going to eat and take some of the new extra meds\\What are you getting up to tonight?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Was a really nice celebration. Just so sad it was so soon. I think it’s going to hit Georgina later today. I think it’s very overwhelming. She does have her kids (our age) with her.\\
Not heard from Becky. Will message now I’m back home.\\Oooh, new shiny meds. Hope they help.\\Meant to be playing some games but might just chill with the TV. Not sure I can stomach being shit and done a lot of talking already.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It must be so horrendous to lose a partner no matter how "expected"\\
How's the throat feeling?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh poor little bub :purple-heart: what do you do in a situation like this?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think expected only helps in the sense they can help plan their own funeral and you can make sure you’ve said everything you want to say. Unless your already over 80 it just all horrible.\\
Throat is doing better. But if a flare up given I’ve spoken a lot this afternoon but definitely on the mend.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Take her to the vet. £132\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's not actually as bad as I expected\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How are you doing today?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m ok. Why?\\
Funeral was more emotional than  expected. Just a stark reminder that we don’t know how much time we have.\\You’ve got my 94 year old Nan. Doing nothing, complaining that she just wants to sit in her chair at home and do nothing rather than the chair at the home and do nothing. She is now well enough that she will burn through £400k of money while still doing nothing but cancer gets Robin instead who was busy doing stuff and living life.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Also Lester has found my next car\\
\url{https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/355928144972}\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just wanted to check on you. Just because.\\
Death is super unfair\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: \url{https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/355928144972?mkcid=16&mkevt=1&mkrid=711-127632-2357-0&ssspo=0LfbvQ4yQUy&sssrc=4429486&ssuid=7Q5HpxsQQmO&var=&widget-ver=artemis&media=WHATS-APP}\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have the new drugs done anything?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: image omitted\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not much tbh\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also I don't know why that sent like that :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: \url{https://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/355928144972}\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah the one time picture was odd. Not that I need that pic saved forever\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's not working for me :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hold on\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But why a little sporty car?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Can you get to eBay?\\
Search eBay for this number\\355928144972\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't worry\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: In Lester’s words I like shit cars.\\
Every now and then he finds an eBay car that he thinks is really like despite it being shit.\\This is one of them. Good choice from him. Super charged, import. Fancy rear screen\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It definitely would\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It will just be us on Thursday. Becky is going back home Thursday morning.\\
I’m meeting her for a dog walk in the morning.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. How is she doing?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I guess I’ll find out more tomorrow but she has had a cold for a week and the fact she is going back home probably isn’t good but I don’t know when the funeral might be. She has been signed off work for quite a while now.\\
Doesn’t seem like she’ll meet up with this Nick guy she is dating either.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think I’ve beat you to bed. Either that or your new drugs kicked in and your asleep somewhere between the sofa and bed.\\
Night night x x x x x x x x x x x x\\Hope the new drugs help.\\Love You :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm just finishing up with the book club.\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
They helped a smidge but is till woke up about 3 times.\\It's a bit bizarre your legs have been hurting so much lately. Could maybe a massage help?\\What time do you have Hannah today? And are you seeing Becky this morning?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: A smidge isn’t a huge amount and the waking up isn’t good. I woke up a bit last night so maybe a weather thing.\\
How are you feeling today?\\Yeah, the legs have been hurting a bit. I thought it was due to some big lifts and the recovery from those. Maybe lack of magnesium as well. Lack of water could also be a thing. Feels like I’m drinking all the time but I don’t think I am.\\Got Hannah at 7:45 then seeing Becky for a dog walk at 10.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They just took the edge off the pain.\\
I haven't gotten up just yet so haven't completely assessed the body situation but I have a headache and am already achey. I'm staying to WFH today\\Yeah sounds like you need to up the water and magnesium\\Hope the session is good. Maybe focus on upper body?\\Please send my love to Becky when you see her\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good plan to wfh. Hope it’s not too bad once you get moving.\\
It’s all upper body today, which is good.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I had to log off after my last meeting yesterday so told Amanda I'll WFH.\\
Ah that's good. Try to stretch those legs though please\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s a cats life. Or maybe he can now sleep after you kept him up all night.\\
Session was good. Knackered now. Felt weak but managed 2x5x60 overhead press.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: How bad is it now you’ve moved?\\
I’m imagining the hangover feeling where it’s ok bad when you wake up and then once you move the horror starts.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think that's literally it. I keep him up at night tossing and turning.\\
That is amazing and not weak at all (but I get what you mean). Well done :flexed-biceps-light-skin-tone:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's that. Forced myself to eat some breakfast and have some meds but I'm all :nauseated-face: and :face-with-head-bandage:. I won't be able to go for a swim today :pensive-face:\\
Where are you going for a walk with Becky?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’d thought you’d have to give the swim a miss. Feels like you really need to scale it back for a few days at least. No point doing stuff super poorly while feeling crap. Just a cycle to despair.\\
“Some meds” have you taken all your meant to?\\Well done on forcing the food. I know it’s rough when you feel shit but it will help you feel ever so slightly less shit eventually.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Going over Hughenden for a walk. Should be grabbing a coffee as well (hopefully).\\
Just hoping it not mega warm for poppy.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I do need to scale back. But I itch to move because I know I can't.\\
Yes I have taken them all :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\Yeah breakfast was really yuk\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It seems there's a breeze so hopefully it will be nice\\
Say hello for me\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You want to move because you can’t??\\
You might have to explain that one.\\There are ranges. There is a middle ground between not moving at all and doing a 5 miles hike. It’s not one or the other.\\The quicker you do less the quicker you’ll feel better and the quicker you can do more. I’m going to screen shot that thing from paired.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-rolling-eyes: you and your logic that makes sense :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Logic wins all the time. I need the t-shirt I saw online\\
“I could be wrong but it’s not happened before.”\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Throwing it in my face just like that :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s your words :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Just a reminder that it is actually ok to slow down especially when you feel better from it.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Lunch nap?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Do you fancy going into town with Lester and Matt on Friday? I might suggest we eat first.\\
Obviously depends how your feeling and you could always leave early. Especially after we have a few drinks\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: A little before lunch nap and it over ran\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah we can do that :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was your walk?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Walk was nice. Becky doing ok. Her brother isn’t as he kept a false hope that Dad could have been ok. She has been signed off for 3 weeks. Going back home tomorrow or tonight.\\
I may have gone too far again gardening. Maybe I just need a skip a week.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Omg what have you cut up?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Will they take a skip that's overfilled?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Exactly, the garden grows faster than I can cut it back. I just thinned the budlier thing at the front as it was getting very tall and overhanging the drive and path.\\
My new mini chainsaw is second best garden tool ever. First being gloves.\\I think they will take it. It will all be dumped on the drive if they won’t. Hopefully any more bricks etc will squash it down\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: How are you doing? Much left in the day?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You might have to cut it up a little to make it fit.\\
I really want to do some gardening soon :beaming-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\I'm glad you're having fun with your garden toy\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm not great. At least the nap has gotten rid of the worst of the headache but moving is a challenge. Will WFH the rest of the week.\\
When is your nerd group?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I thought about cutting it more but I don’t think it will help much. It’s the buds that have the bulk. It would have instantly filled the bin.\\
That’s good about the nap helping with the headache.\\We can wait till tomorrow but don’t want to adjust plans for tomorrow. I can come to you?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No I want to see you and it will be good to get out for a little bit :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You're alright?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What time are you leaving?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep I’m ok. Just finished dinner. Will be leaving at 7:15.\\
How are you doing?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You just didn't reply so was wondering.\\
Hope the nerd group is good. Is Duncan going?\\I've done very little today and am knackered. Headache is back\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: There wasn’t anything to reply to?\\
Duncan should be going. Today was planned to be at his house but need group schedule changed it. Although I’ve not really done anything since coming back from Manchester.\\Oh boo, that’s no fun at all.\\Bath or spike mat or just sit \/ bed.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okay.\\
Oh so is this the cressex one or the Duncan one? I get confused between the two\\Sit bed I think\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: This one is the Cressex one. Nerd group is always cressex otherwise I’ll say I’m going to Duncan’s.\\
Can you make progress on any of your books? Tens machine?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah okay.\\
I have been reading for the last hour and half. I might go for a walk tomorrow before work just to air myself out\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I was trying to find a funny gif for that but have failed.\\
Walk could be good. I guess you haven’t been outside in over a day.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah, last time at lunch yesterday for a bit\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Right I know this is coming because I'm feeling vulnerable because I'm very poorly etc etc. but I miss you. I know we've both been busy and away and what not. Just look forward to spending some proper quality time with you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Me too. It does feel like it’s been a long time since we did very little together.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: We might be able to get the next episode of the gentleman done tomorrow :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha. I can't even remember what happened anymore\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have fun at nerd group\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope you've had a good evening.\\
I'm just in bed. Night night x x x x x x\\Let me know you're home safe.\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: At home now.\\

Awake but still in bed.\\Ah yes. Will they finish the wall today?\\What's the plan for today?\\I'm hurty but I guess we'll see when I get up\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I guess you can have a slow start with WFH.\\
I don’t think they will finish today but he recons tomorrow.\\Plan today. Inside house jobs. Everything’s a bit of a mess and I’m done with gardening for a while. Then I get to see you later.\\Good luck with getting up.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, it's definitely a slower start. I do need to get up now.\\
Ah that's quite good. Only three days really\\Good luck with inside house jobs. Are we still having risotto tonight?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Plus the Saturday they did. 2 people make all the difference. Still a very good day rate for him if they get it done by end of tomorrow.\\
Yes we can still have risotto but we can do something else if you like. I was going to get the slow cooker doing a curry to top up my freezer but we could have that if it’s easier for you.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I do fancy a risotto tbh. Will just need to pick up some garlic bread on my way to you later\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok, do you want me to get it? I don’t have anything needed to make a risotto other than Parmesan cheese\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've got everything we need except the garlic bread so will bring it with me :beaming-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
Only if you were planning on popping out\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I wasn’t going out but I can if it helps you.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you. It would be helpful\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Well it used to be advertised as a neck massager.\\Also love how you always present sex toys on the bed\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Is there a different way you’d like me to present them :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy: no. I did say I love it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Next one I’ll show in the shower or something.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Variety is a spice of life :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Need to get you to try out the other one again. Might be one to test out while we are on the sofa.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah we should try it out again\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What time do you think for later?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Would 6 be alright?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah that works.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Slight change of plan for tomorrow. Lester and Matt and going to come to mine and I’ll cook the curry for tomorrow for everyone.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm taking half a day sick\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :smiling-face-with-hearts::face-with-head-bandage: probably a good idea though.\\
You going to try for a nap or just zone out and not work?\\We can change tonight if needed.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to get some food and go to bed. I had to take a break at 9 already so I thought it might be best.\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll come to you. I need to get out of here for a bit and I want to see you. Just might not look my best :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: DO NOT stand on any of the new bricks\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x\\
I did sleep a little more. Only woke up once towards the morning.\\Oh, does it hurt? Do mention it to Hannah just in case\\Did you sleep well?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sounds like small improvements in the right direction.\\
Doesn’t hurt just feels a bit odd.\\I slept pretty good just could have done longer. I think I slept and didn’t move. Which is probably it. Slept on the same side for too long.\\You doing a slow morning to work?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah yes, not sleeping like a rotisserie chicken does that to us people of certain age. Try stretching it a little to see if it eases\\
I'm going to try a little walk, I'm desperate for some air and then a slow work day.\\Are you up to much after Hannah?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll try and do something today. Speaking to Chris at 11 and then going to see my Nan for 3.\\
Have you decided on tonight?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah yes, of course. Sorry sieve for a brain at the moment.\\
Would it be alright if I skipped this one? Obviously if you want me to come, I will.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s absolutely fine. I’m not going to make you come when you’re feeling bad.\\
You don’t seem to believe that I want you to do the things to help yourself feel better.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I do believe that! But I want to do stuff with you too.\\
Could we please do something on Saturday\/Sunday?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know you want to do stuff but its better for you to feel better so we can actually do stuff\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How about this weekend then?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sorry had to reply quick as was going into the gym and didn’t want to leave it on read.\\
Yes to the weekend. I thought we were anyway. Just need to choose. Can do bookcase or headboard and or boring money stuff. Depends what you feel up to.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you for that :relieved-face:\\
How was the session?\\I think boring money stuff would be the most "urgent"\\I'll need a nap after gym tomorrow but could head over to you in the afternoon?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Session was good. Somewhat funny. Was telling Hannah how I have felt like I’m slowly falling to bits. Which has to be weather related as Hannah has had lots of people tell her the same.\\
So we did deadlift :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: back up to my PB 1x200kg\\Went for 2 but it didn’t move.\\Money is somewhat easy to do as well although might be akward for you. Might need passport and bring your laptop as well. Any idea on time?\\I could do pizza? (I think) <This message was edited>\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you go for a walk? Do you feel any different today?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that's amazing. Well done :flexed-biceps-light-skin-tone:\\
I can bring laptop and passport.\\Maybe 2pm - would that work?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I did go for a little one with Katie. I feel better for being outside. Hopefully one more slow day and I'll be better\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: 2pm works. Thoughts on dinner for tomorrow?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s good. Yes a slow day has to help. Hopefully you can start Monday fresh and get back to a routine\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh pizza would be great. I can get some cold cuts and anything else - I'm going food shopping later. What do we need?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I think I'll have to write down a routine and stick to it for a couple of weeks to see if it makes a difference\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Anything you want on the pizza would be needed. I have some of the meat stick I bought and I have 3 cheeses but no goat. I have chilli bites and chips as well.\\
I was going to suggest a schedule. So you can plan out and work out what training you want to do and see how to fit everything in.\\A good start could be what you had in January.\\Do you want some help shopping?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki I'll pick up some goats cheese and some meat bits.\\
I'll look at the calendar to put some proper schedule in\\Thank you for offering :smiling-face-with-hearts: I'll be fine, I'll just do a slow potter\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok.\\
I’d start the other way round. Ignore the calendar and start with a list of all the things you want to do within a set time frame. A week or 10 days or month. Then we can see how to fit it into the calendar.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki I'll look at it that way :slightly-smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy: too true\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you doom scrolling?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: not really, was just looking at thechive while chatting to Chris. The sometimes have good funny images\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was your catch up?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hows the day going?\\
Brick work is all done. He is going to quote me for slabs out the front and the scary new back wall quote as well\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Catch up was good. Always a bit of a laugh with Chris. He has just be put on a hilarious doomed project at work that the both of us could quickly and easily fix. I've told him my rate is £50k a day. The project is currently burning 6 million a week so I would be a bargin\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm plodding through. Just having some food.\\
Oh they've done it quickly.\\What slabs in the front?\\Let me know what he says and how close\/far we were with guessing yesterday\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Omg :face-screaming-in-fear: what kind of project is that?? That's so much money.\\
Lunch before seeing nan?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Slavs would be to hide the concrete  like paving slabs. Would finish off the front of the house. Should have thought about and had it done the same time as it’s probably only a days work.\\
He can’t say what project which says it’s defence or secret based. So easy for big companies to waste money. They have 111 developers all working on a project that isn’t fully defined or understood. Normal stuff.\\Just about to have lunch now and will go to see Nan for about 3.\\Have you managed a nap?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah okay. He'll be able to do it another time.\\
Ha, of course it's government.\\Haven't managed a nap today but will have one after work\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Pulling an all dayer at work. Well done.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Trying\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that looks so good! :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm glad nan is fine.\\
What time are the boys coming over? Hope Michelle doesn't mind I dropped out\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: They are aiming for 6:30 but we will see. I’m sure Michelle is fine. She is going to risk it with us, if sure for the dinner and then I think she will escape pretty early with the dog.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well still please say I'm sorry\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Will do. Have you shopped?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I went at lunch :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just tidied up and will make dinner and then nothing.\\
Curry all cooked and ready?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh that was a good idea.\\
Curry was on since 11:30. Only rice and naans to cook.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well done. Hope you have a nice evening. Sorry I'm not there\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s ok. Just make sure to take care of yourself. Dinner at my place will certainly be done again. Assuming the curry goes well :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Think I’m going to pass on park run tomorrow and tidy up the front garden instead.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You sure? I could help you tidy up if it gives you time to go?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s moving heavy things around. I guess I can do both. Half expecting my legs to fail after this morning but I do also need to run.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: 2 more for 50\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Woo hoo\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I can move the less heavy things :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: There are a lot of bricks\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll give you a hand as long as I can shower after :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good price :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\

What are you doing with your morning?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It does feel that way. I think it’s a sleep issue.\\
So far not much. I’m just about moving. Will find something.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: How was the gym?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It was very quiet again and I felt very weak which I guess it's understandable.\\
But did 7k on the bike at the end in 23mins\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I guess you would feel weak although I suspect you’re actually a lot stronger than you feel.\\
That’s great on the bike. Well done.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I was hurting on my normal easy weight. Did 2 of the things from Steph's plan and then a pull day\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That still good. You still did stuff\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know. But I wanna be stroooooong right now :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Shower and nap\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well, if you want to be strong you’ll have to do all of the boring self care stuff so that you can be strong :winking-face-with-tongue:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh you and your logic :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What's the plan for today? Just thinking what clothes to put on\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Erm, depends what your feeling up to. I’d probably skip the ball gown. It would be good to move some of the stuff in the drive way but I can do that on my own.\\
If you were dead set on some gardening that can be done.\\Plus the money stuff.\\Or we could go for a walk and get a drink in Hughenden\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well I can come dressed for walk \/putting stuff away and will have cosies for after shower :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That works. Is that what you wanted?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Any of the options will be nice. And we can do money bits before\/after dinner?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok, just making sure I haven’t missed some magic option.\\
Still on for 2pm?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Could we make it 2.30? Really struggled getting up from the nap\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sure.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Don’t rush and we don’t have to do manual labour if you’re not up for it.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Should I maybe ask 2 versions of question. Something like. What do you want to do and what is your body going to let you do?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ha that is a good way of doing that. It's not always the same thing\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just leaving\\

How’s spud?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I got shouted at as I walked in but he's happily munching on din dins now x\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Will potter onto bed\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How much pottering is needed your already in bed clothes.\\
Cat fed, clean teeth. Done :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I can't sleep in these!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok, clean teeth, change clothes done\\

Hope you sleep better and have a good swim in the morning.\\Love You :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00022540-GIF-2024-08-11-08-07-53.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x x\\
Swim was nice and according to my watch I slept through the night. I did wake up about 20mins before the alarm.\\How did you sleep?\\Your Tri friends were here this morning\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s quite a good sleep improvement for you then.\\
I slept ok. I basically passed out  I didn’t manage to hit snooze on my audio book and woke up a few hours later to it still going :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\Oh my brothers friends.\\Did you do the 750?\\You off to your next social gathering now?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, your brother's friends. They were asking whether you didn't fancy an early Sunday :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
No, I only did the 400. It was still hard.\\Yup just got to the rye, waiting for Laura.\\What are you doing with your morning?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well they would be right :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
I need to get out of bed and eat then will start moving the stuff in the front garden to the back\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I need to have some food. Getting hungry now\\
Just getting a coffee and will pop to Lidl. Do you need anything?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you not eaten today?\\
Thanks but I can’t think of anything.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Uhm, I had a banana\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So a snack then :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've had watermelon now and will have some proper food before nap :smiling-face:\\
It is so so hot outside already\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Watermelon. Calm down. That has to be mostly water\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah, it is\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Let me know once you’ve napped.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've napped :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done. How you feeling. I’m just about to have lunch.\\
Can confirm that is it stupid hot outside :hot-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sleepy :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
I'll get myself together and let you know when I'm ready to come over.\\How's the front garden going?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok, I’ve not showered yet.\\
You’ll have to tell me when you turn up. :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's not going to be in the next hour\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okay if I leave now?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Give it 5. Literally jumping in the shower\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No worries\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: If you haven’t left already go for it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki\\
Leaving now\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Home :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That took a while\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done.\\
Another enjoyable afternoon\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I love just spending time with you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Was reading messages in the car :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, so popular :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Question. Did I miss the chance to have a repeat of yesterday’s bedroom activities? I got the sense you were too tired \/ yuk feeling for it.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ermmm, yeah you did\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know you primarily have my comfort and wellbeing at heart so you don't want to make the first move necessarily, but unless I'm in a flare like last week please go for it. I'm always in some kind of pain, just different levels :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And tbh I didn't think you were in the mood\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Why didn’t you think I was in the mood?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't know\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Helpful :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well why did you think I wasn't?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You seemed more tired than you were yesterday and had had a busy morning of doing stuff.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh, fair enough.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well I guess we need to communicate a little better :smiling-face:\\
What would help you know\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah. It’s something I’m not the best at talking about “in the moment”.\\
I also still don’t know how I could have transitioned from us being in the sofa to going upstairs.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: With a little heavy petting?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I guess. I was trying to get you to lay down but kept failing.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Bub, we are together and can literally talk about everything and anything. You know I want us to be open with each other. I know these things are still a little harder for you but I've also mentioned that it would be nice to not initiate every time. Would make me feel wanted\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know. I just got the feeling today that I’d be “bothering you” (can’t think of a better phrase and I know it’s the wrong phrase). It also feels wrong to jump you as you walk through the door and then it was the no man’s land of being on the sofa.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It is the wrong phrase. You are never bothering me. I can't state this strongly enough\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know bothering was the wrong word.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you finished the chase sign up?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just about to do it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Done! They will text me when they finish checking\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: So much adult\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So so much\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Now you get to care even more about interest rates and the state of the stock market\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sounds right. It’s 3.85 at the moment\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, it was on the next page :face-with-tears-of-joy::woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was better but it’s a lot better than zero\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you for helping me with this\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Your welcome. It’s not taught and I only know and do what I’m doing because of conversations with Lester and Ross.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I can transfer money into it straight away?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: If you’ve got a sort code and account number then yeah.\\
I’d test with £10 first.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki good plan\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It worked\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Wooo\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm still scared to send more :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly. Me and money\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I do always have to double check when sending money\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've sent another 500 now and will do the rest tomorrow :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The more you do it the easier it gets\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I feel very adulty\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :smiling-face-with-hearts: well done.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :smiling-face-with-hearts::smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
How's your evening going?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s ok. Have eaten, sat and watched tv. Puts the bins out.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Such adult too\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Watched anything good?\\
I'm pottering to bed to start the new book\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Such adult.\\
Been watching new girl. Will switch to you tube in a bit.\\Is it a slightly less depressing book this time?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yes. It's the second installment of the one I started on Tuesday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Enjoy\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Wow that was fast. Can you message her and say what you want. Maybe there is a waiting list\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I will do\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: All tucked in with the book\\
Hope you sleep well. Night night x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\LOVE YOU :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night night x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
Hope the book is good.\\Love You :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: A thought before I turn in. What about a sleep over in Friday or Saturday? Your choice on location now we know the blow up bed fits.\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
It was raining when I woke up but it's already so warm here too.\\Did you sleep well?\\Yes, I'd like a sleepover :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: Saturday? I could sleep in the spare room\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, you want to risk my house. I won’t put the maze on it then :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:.\\
Slept ok. Was up a bit, not sure why.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I struggled to fall asleep even without the duvet.\\
Haha, more sound proofing than in mine :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Do you have Hannah today?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not today. It got moved to Wednesday so just spin today\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah enjoy spin. Hope it's good\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think a new heart rate record. I saw 175 on the watch. Not the biggest calorie burn though. Good class and lots of people this week.\\
I did see a new pillow that is meant to help with snoring. Will look at it later.\\Do you want be to get anything to try and make my spare room better for you?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I'm glad it was a good class.\\
What are you up to for the rest of the day?\\Thank you for thinking of that. Maybe just decluttering a little or arranging it a bit would be helpful but you don't need to get anything. I'll probably bring my pillow :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not sure what I’ll do today. I’ve got loads I want to do but I think the heat will ruin all of it so today might just be a chill day. There is a couple of boring admin computer bits I need to do.\\
Spare room is a must for this week so it should look different for you. I was going to suggest pillow and weighted blanket anyway. Would be nice if you don’t wake up crying in pain. As the baseline minimum.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, yeah as a baseline minimum that would be great. I did sleep better on the spare bed so :crossed-fingers-light-skin-tone:\\
Please don't forget to drink loads of water :purple-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Better as in not crying isn’t the greatest of improvements.\\
The sofa bed is always an option as well.\\You too on the water.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your morning been?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Been ok. Just ordered £300 of garden stuff :loudly-crying-face:\\
Well I say stuff. It's 25 bags of bark and 140kg of stones for the pond.\\Just working through some robot emails and seems like there are some uni emails to work through. Will then do lunch. Its getting warm.\\How are you getting on?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Very productive! Well done for getting the garden bits.\\
It is really warm. Hopefully your house is keeping cool.\\It's been alright, just getting on with bits and then have 3 meetings in the afternoon\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good luck with the meetings.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: \url{https://www.reddit.com/r/Fibromyalgia/s/vAOFUK5ehB}\\
I think this was the drug you were talking about.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yes, that's the one\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: \url{https://ms-uk.org/low-dose-naltrexone-multiple-sclerosis-choices-booklet/}\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you for this. Seems UK is not very keen on prescribing it but definitely something I'll keep in mind for medication review\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not keen but not impossible\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just had a call from the physiotherapist at Wycombe, got an appointment on 27th\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh great. How long have you been waiting on that call\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I requested the referral when you took me to amersham. So 12 weeks\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :man-facepalming: oh the speed\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well better than the 53 weeks I waited for that one :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: True but 12 weeks is suspicious. Like there target is 12 weeks so you got the call before it messed with it. At least it’s done\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly I wasn't even expecting it until like October\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm well versed with NHS waiting times\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know but stuff taking this long actually makes the stuff take longer. Delaying booking an appointment is just silly.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know. But there are only so many people being able to do those apps :woman-shrugging-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know but I’ve seen them do this weird thing with how far they can book into the future as well. Just a lot of unnecessary steps and added pain that could be made better without more people. Just more logic.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: NHS is a beast, as frustrating as it can be, often they are doing as best as they can\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It certainly suffers from a failure in the “one rule for all”. To hit what that to work.\\
Just the barrier to entry is so high. Once your in people are super helpful.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Are all your meetings done now?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup all done. Trying to get some 12 week feedback from people as well\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done. Day nearly over then.\\
\url{https://shop.dicksonchemist.co.uk/product/urgent-prescriber-consultation-referred-by-the-ldn-research-trust/}\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Found the UK loophole\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Omg it's so warm in my flat :hot-face:\\
How's your afternoon?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah it’s super warm. I’ve basically done nothing but watch tv. Been drinking water all day but still got a headache from the weather.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What did you think (if you’ve thunk about it) to the LDN link prescription link thing I found.\\
Worth a call?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: And yes. Thunk is the past tense of think :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have a cold shower, it will help. Or at least pop your feet in cold water\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Do I have a bucket. That’s the question\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to mention it at my next medication review. I haven't been on the new ones for even 6 months yet and they are definitely working better than my previous ones majority of the time. I want to give my body time to adjust not only to the meds but also the change of life :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh you can just sit on the edge of the bath, that's what I do :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: This feels like the start of a “how I fell in the bathroom and hit my head” story\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahahahah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I live on the edge\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Of the bath!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What are you doing tonight?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00022680-GIF-2024-08-12-17-10-12.mp4>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No idea. Maybe games but my office is a sweat box so maybe nothing.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Could you put a fan in there or will it just blow hot air on you?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What’s your plans?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Fan might help to just move the air at least. The hair dryer that is my graphics card does a great job of keeping my feet warm\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Potter a little, laundry, make up lunch, 15 showers\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I can imagine\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Only 15\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You need a paddling pool in your garden\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I just filled in the pond:rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Paddling pool...not the pond thingy :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Bestway 6ft Fast Set Pool, Above Ground Swimming Pool for Kids and Adults, Outdoor Inflatable Pool, 940L, Blue\\
\url{https://amzn.eu/d/2PzT0xL}\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You'd love it!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll order it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You don't have to do it for me. Only if you want it and will use it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Of course I’ve done it for you. I might use it and it could be laugh.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-holding-back-tears::face-holding-back-tears::face-holding-back-tears::face-holding-back-tears:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You're too sweet you know that :purple-heart:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thank you.\\
I try.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You do :smiling-face-with-hearts: and I appreciate it and you immensely\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll be going to Slovakia in November :grimacing-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you booked tickets?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Will do tomorrow. Just need to book work time off\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you chosen a date then?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah, 16-22\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What prompted it? I know you have spoke about it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I just have to go at some point and those were the only dates that worked\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You up to much?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Only melting\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Do you have a list of people to visit in Slovakia?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah, mostly family\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's always very stressful when I go\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I did get that sense. You’ll force yourself into a flare if you worry about it too much.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know. It's just ...\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Btw you know you can ask me stuff if you want to know something\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know but as we talked about the other day we haven’t actually spent a huge amount of alone time together recently. Where we would talk about stuff. Serious stuff isn’t the best over txt as I think tone and delivery can be important.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh absolutely agree. I'm just saying that if you want you can :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: I'll try my best\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: There has been a few times, I don’t have a specific so maybe it’s more of a feeling, that when some of this stuff comes up you say what you want and leave out the more nasty details. Then I do wonder if I should ask more or just leave it as I sometimes get the impression you don’t want to talk about it. Example being freezer food. Didn’t feel like I should have pushed it any further than we did.\\
Plus there is my “don’t ask questions you don’t want the answer to” theory. So I do sometimes thinks I’d like to know but should I or it’s just not my business to know just to satisfy some curiosity (this is more general than specific to your family).\\As an actual example we somehow breezed over the fact the other day you mentioned you either nearly did or actively tried to have a child with an ex on the idea it would save the relationship.\\Not the conversation to just casually bring up.\\Add to it all that if and when we could talk about stuff my mind goes blank or we are having a nice time and the idea of unloading a bag of trauma out on the floor might ruin the mood a bit.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You are right. I do edit out bits. I haven't thought that you were ready for a trauma dump like that. Like if you know you'll think differently of me. I might not volunteer stuff all the time but I will try to explain anything you ask about.\\
Oh that was more of a funny haha story about how stupid I was as a 20 year old. And I didn't try to have a baby, just thought I wanted one. And I couldn't have had one anyway. 20 year olds are stupid, and so was I.\\Talking about big things should help us build a deeper intimacy\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think we all edit out bits to protect ourselves.\\
I can’t comment on the whole “thinking different” thing. That’s part of the risk of being in a relationship.\\Oh, I thought the baby thing  wasn’t as long ago as that.\\Talking about things does help build intimacy and we have a lot more to talk about than we have already talked about. We have time.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well I hope you wouldn't think differently of me just because I've had a fucked up childhood\\
Omg yeah it was a lifetime ago\\We do have time and I do want to talk about absolutely everything with you\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah I would hope so as well but as a general thing you never know how people will react to information.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Reassuring :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: it’s true though. You don’t know how people will react. Despite my best efforts to predict.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I mean I'd say that I would still love you. My childhood was not my fault\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is what I should have said and it is true\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't want to be putting words in your mouth :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I did think about writing that but then didn’t for some reason and went off on a tangent\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hah okay\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did you play games?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Nope, just melting on the sofa\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Will have to shower before going to bed\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did you watch anything good?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I watched the new guy Richie film on prime. It was good. A shame it was straight to prime as it would have been much better in the cinema.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Which one?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yeah, want to watch that\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And the Weird Al biopic with Daniel Radcliffe :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That could be interesting\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've seen some clips and it looks hilarious\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: All tucked in but it's so hot.\\
Hope you manage to get some sleep tonight. Do you have anything in the morning?\\Night night x x x x x x x x x x x\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done.\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x x\\
I slept some, woke up a couple of times. How about you?\\What are you up to today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Woke up a fair amount but otherwise ok.\\
Going to tackle some of the spare room today and maybe look at \/ prep some of the kitchen.\\Hopefully it’s not as horrid as yesterday.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh good luck with the spare room! We can always drop clothes and bits at a charity shop :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
Hopefully it's a bit cooler today\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Why is it always sooo hot when I’m motivated to sort stuff. Been at it for a couple of hours and not sure anyone would notice :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, I hope you have windows open on both sides to get some breeze.\\
What have you done so far?\\I think the spare room will take a few days' work\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m not even sure what I’ve done. Taken ages to get the printer from the spare room to the printer room so have rearranged there printer room a bit, hovered, thrown out a bag of stuff and created a new box of paper rubbish. Have somehow emptied 3 of the plastic boxes I have. Now about to take the speakers to the recycle shop place at the dump along with the coffee machine and an old router.\\
Need to get a move on to get some onions to slow cook dinner for later :man-facepalming:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hope your day is going well\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That is quite a bit of stuff! Well done!\\
What are you cooking later?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Doing the curry again so I restock the freezer then will run chilli tomorrow.\\
Just gotta keep doing bits until the room is done. Or at least better and more usable. Was already thinking of some Lilly system thingy so I could maybe suspend the maze from the ceiling :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Lilly system?\\
But yes, when you're decluttering it's always a case of having to continue until it's done and it's usually such a big job!\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Silly system\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Took forever to get to and from the dump vs how easy it was to hand over the stuff.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That looks great!\\
I'm just leaving work\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What time is spin?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Spin is at 6 so will be leaving in 10.\\
I’m not sure what comments but I expected some comment from the planner list.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: <attached: 00022759-AUDIO-2024-08-13-17-33-32.opus>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s very difficult to read a voice message :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
This list was just a first pass of what I’d like to try and do and then need to see if and when it can fit into a 7 day week. The spin classes I can’t control at the moment and I’m shit at going to the gym on my own but maybe as I’ve typed the spin class converts to at home bike while it’s not available.\\Sounds like a long day for you. Have a bit of a rest before book club. If you can.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha soz. Got to be done while in traffic.\\
Yes, the each week bit might need tweaking a little, especially when uni starts back up again but you can see how much you can fit in without burning yourself out.\\It has been a long day. Will see if I can do some food and a shower.\\Hope spin is good :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Will need a tweak to be realistic and see what uni actually turns into. I did the exercise a few years ago and it’s interesting to list what you want to do and map to what has been going on.\\
I expected some sort of comment around the 3 sex vs only one dinner :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: I don't know how that will work\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I was hoping you’d have some ideas for that. I can always pop round on a morning hour wfh :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was spin\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was good. Nice and busy. Not mega hard compared to Tams class but sooo much better than Joseph’s class.\\
Just made it home.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well that wasn’t a no\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's good. Will you be going to this one now?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We'll see how it shakes out when you tweak it realistically :winking-face:\\
We don't even have time to even see each other 3 times a week :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Maybe, the Monday night one is better and the instructor from today. It was meant to be a different instructor but got lucky it was covered by Angela.\\
I could do the Wednesday one as well and maybe I should give it another try.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I mean we should be able to see each other as much as we want. We are both in control of our destinies just also busy.\\
Realistically unless we carve out extra time somewhere it will be 0-1\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Maybe you could just try them all and see which works best for you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I mean should yes, realistically we both have a lot on and I'm working. But I would like for us to book in proper time together\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What will you be doing tonight?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just finishing up dinner and then playing games with Matt. Will see what it’s like as it’s getting very frustrating seemingly getting worse at the game that I’m actually trying to be good at.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: When’s book club? Is it out out or zoom.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you have some discount code for the food app?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How were the games?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's at agi's, still here but should be heading home soon\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think it should be 2CCNC24  but you need to go through the actual website\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Aggressively Mid. I'll blame the heat for some it but we are just getting worse. Doesn't help that I am not currently using the best guns in the game and they give a clear advantage. We should have won one game but Matt made a terrible call, so we lost. I think all the shit players have given up and we are just left with what we call the "mega sweats" who are just brilliant at the game.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: OH, super late night for you then.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah, what a description. So had a good night then?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yes. Just got home\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The night was ok. Just frustrating when I used to play better. Games are meant to be fun and I’m not sure I’m having much fun with it at the moment.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Would trying a different game help?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done. I’m already in bed so will wish you good night\\
Night night x x x x x x x x x x x x\\Hope you sleep fast\\Love You :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Maybe, just need to find one. There are a couple I’d like to try. I like playing Warzone but only when I’m not shit :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Can't believe you beat me to bed. I'm losing my sleepy girl edge .\\
Night night x x x x x x x x x x\\Sleep well.\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Paired!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep, you’re losing your edge. It used to be 9-9:30\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know! Need to get back to it.\\

Night :red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00022795-GIF-2024-08-14-07-07-28.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
I've slept some again. How about you?\\Oh that is a weird timing. Hope the session is good\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I slept ok. Proper first world problem, I don’t think my AC is as cold as it used to be.\\
Do you still want to go swimming later? What time.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah, I was thinking the same about my car one\\
Yeah, if it doesn't rain I'd like to go. 5.30 ISH?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: The car might need a top up and your journey to work is very stop start so not a lot of airflow to help it.\\
ISH :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\I can pick you up\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You drove last time so I can get you :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
Yeah I need to get it topped up\\More 5.30 than ISH :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have to drive past to pick you up so it’s not a problem and saves you some energy\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. Thank you :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
How was sesh?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sesh was good. Arms are dead. Tried the new tricep dip machine. A huge machine given the muscle it works but different to doing dips.\\
I really should have arranged for my garden stuff to arrive tomorrow but never mind.\\Also should have someone come round today to quote I the roof so I now have 2 things arriving at the house with a completely unknown timeframe :loudly-crying-face:\\How is your spoon levels after your late night?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh which one is that one?\\
Oh busy day waiting for you today. Are you up to much today?\\Spoons are definitely running low and I've been in solid succession of meetings all morning and going into two more before lunch :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was a new machine this week that is right in the middle of the gym. It’s in front of the ego making arm pull machine.\\
Garden stuff has been delivered and roof guy should be here any minute. Then I’ll keep going with the upstairs tidy up \/ moving shit around task. Got the garden stuff put by the garage so I don’t think it needs moving for the skip to be taken. So no made rush to move it all. It doesn’t look like a lot of stones for the pond :man-facepalming:\\Oh fun. Meetings keep the corporate machine turning.\\Maybe you need Tuesday or Wednesday to be a wfh day? Break up the week a bit.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh will have a look at it when I go in\\
Ah good that it's already been delivered. Hope the roof quote is not horrendous.\\Yeah I might think about that. But next week I need to be in wed-fri so it will be a nice stretch at home\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Roof quote done. Needs scaffolding to get a proper look but will then do work at the same time. Might even be done within a week. £500 for the scaffolding and then he recons maybe £500 for the rest but i think more £1500. Which is Sooo much better than I thought it could be.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That is absolutely so much better than expected. Are you going to get him to do it?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep, I didn’t have anyone else to phone and seems like he knew what was going on.\\
I had a fear it was going to be £5k so if it 1500 or less that’s brilliant\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Very productive morning for you. Well done\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well. A gym workout and then waiting for 2 things to happen. I need to get moving and do something more before lunch\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah but two things got sorted, garden and roof\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Looking forward to seeing you later.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How is it raining :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
I should have been a meteorologist. They can just make it up.\\House work takes an unreasonable amount of time for the job it is.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Me too\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Is it raining? Hope it's still warm though.\\
I've had such a busy day, brain is mush but I said I had a hard stop at 4 so just leaving.\\How's your afternoon been?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Seems to have stopped raining now.\\
Skip is gone.\\Look at your with the corporate speak “hard stop”\\Afternoon has been all over the place. Got some stuff done. Laundry, washing up and putting clothes away shouldn’t take that long.\\Waiting for some guys to come round and put up some scaffolding so they can look at the roof properly. They are running late but I don’t know by how much yet.\\Do you still want to go to the lake?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah good! Everything is getting done.\\
You did get stuff done well done.\\Scaffolding already going up? That's quick.\\Yes, I still want to go. How about you? Will you have time?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: The scaffolding is being squeezed it at the end of the day. Much faster than I was expecting but it all needs to be done.\\
I’m wavering on actually swimming but I’d like to go. Well I’d like to see you. Just needs these guys to turn up first. Might have to meet you there but will see if they get here before 5. They don’t need access to the house.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. Let me know :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: They have arrived and think it’s only an hour so I can pick you up once they are done?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okay. But let me know if they still have loads to do at 5.30?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Or I can meet you there if it’s simpler?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We can do that. I was thinking of going around 5.30. I'll text?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok. I know you wanted to go at 5:30 and predictably I think this will be 15-20 minutes past that\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki, I'll still text you to see what's happening\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Wow, scaffolding is louder than having a brick wall knocked down. :loudly-crying-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I can imagine. Metal on metal  :disappointed-face: <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The clanging. These guys must be deaf\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Most probably\\
Is it going up fast?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Seems so. I’m keeping out the way\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good plan\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's it looking?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Looking good they are adding the wood. 10-15 mins I think but not sure. You go if you want and I’ll catch up. If you go they will finish soon if you wait something will slow them down.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha okay. Are you sure you're okay if we meet there?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah it’s fine. If it’s better for you to get going then go. I’ll meet you when you get out of the water.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okay. Katie should be getting there just before 6 so you might make it just as we're going in\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok. As predicted they are just packing up. See you in a bit\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Home. Thank you for coming tonight. Loved seeing you and having a cuddle\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Very much same.\\
Dinner has been successfully reheated.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well done. I have fed the beast\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Was he mad\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ever so slightly\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you find food?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I had some of that protein cereal. Ended up not being very hungry\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh, your go to quick dinner\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup. 100grams of protein today!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just sorting my meds and then bed. Are you doing anything else tonight?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Managed 242 today.\\
Just watching some TV and will be going to bed soon.\\Roof people are back at 9am tomorrow.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well done! That's loads. I don't know how you do that\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: This is my Nutracheck diary for Wednesday 14 Aug 2024.\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That is very good!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thanks, taken a while to work it out.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Still quite high calories\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'd like to think that I've been a little better with food recently but I don't know\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: A little. Steph would say, no carbs on non training days\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think you have. Helps when it’s tracked\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But also!! 3 bits of veg!!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know ! Soo many.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You're doing better with that. And it will be easier in winter because I'll hide loads in soups and stews :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The soup is good\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll make it soon\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you made it to bed yet?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: On my way :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not even close :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
I think I slept reasonably alright, but did wake up at 5 :confused-face:\\Hope roof people start soon.\\I'm just leaving the gym, soaked\\The painting moving is good plan. You have had a lot of stuff pop up this week\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh you went to the gym well done. How did it go?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I haven't been this week so wanted to get something done\\
It wasn't actually that bad. I did a push day. And I'm 25kg on bench now and shaved off a minute of 7k cycle\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning\\
Treadmill warmup 5 mins+ stretch\\Push day\\Bench (programme)\\5@20kg\\5@22.5kg\\5@25kg\\Strict press (programme)\\5@17.5kg\\5@20kg\\5@22.5kg\\Incline chest press dumbbell\\8@7.5kg each side\\8@7.5kg each side\\8@7.5kg eac side\\Bench chest flys dumbbell\\10@5kg each side\\10@5kg each side\\10@5kg each side\\Superset\\Push-up 3 sets x 7\\Delt flys\\10@5kg each side x 3\\Lateral raises\\10@5kg each side x3\\Plate frontal raises\\10@10kg x 3\\Bike 7k 21mins\\Stretch\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done you did loads.\\
That’s such a good jump on bench from 20 to 25.\\Did you see the new massive machine.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I kept to myself upstairs because all the big boys were being loud downstairs and it was too early for that :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was that busy in the morning? It was nearly dead yesterday.\\
You should have said you were going to the gym I could have gone with you.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I thought I did. When we were planning this week I said I'll go in the morning so we could have time together in the evening\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You probably did earlier in the week I just forgot.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sorry! Will definitely tell you next time :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Knew it was good to be true. Roof is more broken than I would have liked. Going to be £4k but is going to be a new roof.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oof, that is a definite difference price wise.\\
What is wrong with the roof?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Felt is fucked at the ridge cap and some cap tiles are lose as well. Felt is buggered where it was leaking anyway and the battons are rotten. So tiles are coming off. They are going to to add in an extra row of tiles to increase the overlap.\\
They are going to clean the gutter as well :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Makes you realise what houses are made of it and they both are and aren’t very complicated.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Also, BBQ at Toria’s house tomorrow at 6:30.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah that's a fair bit of work.\\
Did they say when they can start?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah brilliant!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: They’ve started. Could be done by end of day Monday\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh wow. They are fast moving\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Seems quick to take all the tiles down. 2 guys.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I want to make you scream later :winking-face-with-tongue::smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: In a happy way?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Obviously in a good way\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Alright then :winking-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Why wouldn’t it be that way and if it was going to be in a bad way why would I phrase it that way.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Omg that was a joke\/tease\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh ok.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's the roof looking?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ve not looked in a while as they keep throwing stuff off the top. Something is happening as there is a lot of banging. There is clearly a big hole in the roof as my loft hatch is lit up :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you napped?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I hope it doesn't rain today!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: A little bit but work's been busy\\
How's your afternoon been?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: They have said the roof will be water proof before they leave. I thought they’d have left already but I get the sense they might have seen a way to finish tomorrow. Will see.\\
I think I’ve been busy. Got stuff done. You’ll have to tell me if you can see any difference.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oooh that's exciting for me - how many differences do I need to spot?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have no idea :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: at least 5 or 6. Maybe 10\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Wooo hoo\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Please remind me about the curry before I leave\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I will try. Why don’t you put it in front of the door now?\\
I do have one.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's good point\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Do we need anything apart from naan and poppadoms?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I don’t think so. We don’t need to go mad.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. I might get myself a little salad\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oooh, crazy :winking-face-with-tongue:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: High protein pudding?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Which one do you need?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have no idea just remembered you said you thought some a while ago.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ooooh!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: you still aiming for 6? The guys are just packing up. I need to nip out to a cash machine to make sure I have enough cash and then shower.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What time shall I come?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think I can still do 6 if it works for you. You just might need to let yourself in\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki I'll aim for just after 6\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't remember your code :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: 258369 *\\
on the keypad it down the middle (not the zero) down the right side and then star. I should give you a tag really\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: press palm flat on the keypad to activate first\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm running late, so sorry. Just leaving home and will stop in the shop\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hoooome\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That took a while.\\
I really enjoyed this evening.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It didn't. Normal time. I wasn't even texting when I parked up :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
I really enjoyed tonight too :relieved-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, just felt like it took a while.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Are you speed pottering to bed?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes yes I am. Are you?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I will in a bit. Just some you tube first :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha of course\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: All tucked in.\\

Katie fit back late from a work thing so we postponed and I had an extra lay in which was nice\\How did you sleep?\\Hope the session is good :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just heard from Katie. They'll be with you at 1.15. is that okay?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Lie in is a good idea. You’d done a bit of both end candle burning this week.\\
1:15 is great. Is Katie staying or dropping? Either is fine and I have WiFi if she needs.\\Slept well actually. Just woke up tired :sleeping-face: but slept through.\\Session was good. 3x5x120kg squats. Hamstring curls are up from 25 to 40 in a month or so.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: She'll stay to work if that's okay.\\
Oh well done! Those are heavy things. My strong man :flexed-biceps-light-skin-tone:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah that completely fine, probably better :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:.\\
Thank you. Just need to get the diet going in the right direction consistently.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We'll both get there with food, just takes time.\\
What time are the roof guys coming?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Roof people are anytime now :man-facepalming:. So I’m stuck in wait mode.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh it's so helpful when they say "be there anytime after 9"\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think I was told “about 9” but equally as bad.\\
“Some time tomorrow” is the worst.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha yes;\\
Just tell me wheeeeen\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Or at least say when it won’t be.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What time is mum coming round?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not sure yet. “Some time this afternoon” :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup that sounds good. Sure you don't need me to pick anything up?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I don’t think so. Unless you have some zero gin\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't think I do :disappointed-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: We can drop into the Tesco express on the way to see if they have any.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Roof are here\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Woop\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I can barely lift my arms today :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy: All that heavy lifting\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: its good though\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I guess it is :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's the roof?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: as long as its good pain and not "I;m ruined forever pain"\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: the roof is roofing. They have new tiles and plastic things. Its all very loud\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It will be nice next week to not have trades people working. Back to quiet\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I bet! You did have a lot of things happening this week\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The adulting has got super boring today. Just had to try and find who my car insurance was with and that needs renewing. Took ages to find out who I'm with now. Only to find out I need to do it tomorrow not today. Then had a panic about house insurance but that's done. SO, now I have a boring little table with all the details setup and a print out on my fridge\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh well done on all that hard adulting! I hate doing insurance stuff\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also....\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Happy 9 months :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh Damn you beat me to it. Happy 9 Months :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Child labour used.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah brill. How was it?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good, super quick. The pond is done. I might not have ordered enough bark but will have to see. The bags are a lot lighter than I thought. Would have taken me a good hour or so to get it all done so nice to get the boring stuff done.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was Ethan?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: He was good. Just got on with it. Seemed very pleased to earn some money\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Brilliant. I'm glad it worked out. Did you speak to Katie about the annuity?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Briefly yes, she has someone who might be able to help. So will talk to Mum about it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah good\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How’s the day been \/ going?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's been busy and I'm definitely tired :sleeping-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I don’t think tonight will be late.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What do I wear?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Clothes would be a start. I have no idea. What you’d wear to dinner I guess\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I thought going naked :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sorry madness ensued but everyone has left now.\\
What you wore on Sunday was cute? If you haven’t decided.\\I’m just jumping in the shower.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh what happened?\\
I cannot remember what I wore on Sunday :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Full body dress thing. You have 2. Different styles but they seem to be you favourites\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Mum and dad were here. Roof people finished and then Mark just turned up with my cash delivery with the raptor\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh busy afternoon!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What did we do on Sunday?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The Sunday we went out with your friend\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oooooh.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I just washed it so it's wet\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Something else then :man-shrugging::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: the other one or did you wash both\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't know what the other one is. I only have that long one that's my favourite\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll figure something :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok, I’m not very good at this.\\
You did wear some dress with thingy in London where you had the fancy pasta . That the other one I meant\\Or something completely different. I’ll just be in shorts and polo\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't worry, me neither. I can't remember :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
I am dressed\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: There was a picture of you eating said pasta wearing the dress. Black with flowers maybe.\\
Well done.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm leaving in 2\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Home!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Enjoyed this evening. We need to get some more dates booked in with people\\

I'm alright. Had a very tossy turny night but fine.\\Did you sleep well?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh no that’s a pain.\\
I slept ok,   Nothing special. <This message was edited>\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just one of those nights :woman-shrugging-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll see you soon :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m near the toilets next to Agi\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's the roof been? We're about half hour from the bounty if you fancied coming?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Roof is done and I’ve hovered the loft. Such fun :hot-pepper:\\
I’ll just jump in the shower and come and meet you.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yay!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I don’t know why but I just had the idea we could make popcorn later\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Am I meeting you at spade oak or the bounty? As I think I’m at the wrong one\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Bounty :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok, 6 minutes\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki we just got here\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: There is absolutely no where to park\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Voice call, 45 sec\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did you manage to park?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Take some electrolytes, if you haven’t already\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I will do :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just managed to drag myself out from bed. Will shower, pack some stuff, feed spud and head over.\\
Do I need to stop at the shop for anything?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done.\\
I don’t think anything is needed unless you’re desperate for a salad.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll see how I feel on the way :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh my gaaaaaawd\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It looked bigger in the picture\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's nice. Perfect to have a little sit down in :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Home.\\
Was just chatting to neighbour Amy downstairs\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done. Have you been given evils from his lordship?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Very much. Shouting behind the door even before I put the key in :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Had a little nappy nap. Popped a hair mask on and will have a potter. What have you been getting up to?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done. I’ve not done much. Sorted my car insurance. Super yay. Cleaned my office from leaving the window open. Yay. Had lunch and just been watching TV.\\
Going to try out a new game later with Matt but that’s about it.\\Has your headache gone?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That is loads! Well done for being productive.\\
Oh what game are you trying?\\It's shifted to a little dull ache at the back. Has yours gone?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: We are going to try hell divers 2\\
It’s a co-op player vs environment game. Should be more fun and less pressure. We will see.\\I think mines gone.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh sounds fun! Hope it goes well\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It looks fun. It’s like they made a game out of the silliness of starship troopers\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha. Well can't wait to hear about it :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: enjoy a little rest.\\
How are the legs feeling?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Legs are completely fine. If I don’t move. Otherwise it’s like you saw this morning. :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: please make sure you have a bath later\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I should do that now before I start playing games.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That would be good!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think I left my phone charger at yours\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You did. Do you need it?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No I'll be alright until I see you next :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
How's the game?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: ok\\
The game is good fun. Quite a bit to learn but its fun, which is nice.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aw I'm glad you're having a fun time with it. Makes a change from the stressful times with Matt :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Makes a nice change. Just need 2 other players.\\
Never consistently had 3 other people who all wanted to play the same game and were any good at it.\\Have you had a bath?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not yet, just watching some TV after dinner\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You all set for the week?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I haven't really done much past hairmask and shower :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: but yes I think so\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s good at least. Nice slow day.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes. Oh and I precooked some eggs :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have you finished the game?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah we finished just before 7 to have dinner etc.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah okay!\\
Have you had your Sunday beige buffet?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Beige dinner rather than buffet. Had the kiev\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Now watching you tube. Will probably go to bed soon.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh how was it?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: My neighbour's washing machine just broke so I chucked her clothes in mine\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was ok. I managed to burn myself on some beans. Seems to be a normal thing for me to do now :man-facepalming:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh no. Have you got to get them back to her today?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah but it's only like 45mins. I was going to read anyway\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh noooo :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: When it gets this late I’d definitely be leaving the washing\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: She was worried about them. And she's had some really hard things to deal with lately so I kinda didn't want this to be the straw that breaks the camels back if you know what I mean. It's so negligible from my end and a massive thing for her\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s is nice when neighbours help each other out.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah it is. And I'm reading anyway so no skin off my nose :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
What are you watching on YouTube?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: There was a new Warzone video then a sailing video and just done a couple of gun video’s that looked interesting.\\
Spin is cancelled :loudly-crying-face:. So a bit of a lie in tomorrow before Hannah\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no, that's rubbish. What time do you have Hannah?\\

Leg is still hurty. I did sleep better and just been for a walk with Katie. On my way home now\\Did you sleep well?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Glad you slept better but boo for the leg still hurting.\\
Slept ok but woke up before my alarm which was a pain.\\Just got back. Arms ruined. Made the sensible thought to not lift things in the house today.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Are you planning on gym Thursday morning?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's got a bloody good bruise blooming too :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Ah well done on the sesh.\\What's your plan today?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No because I'm in the office :confused-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think I'll go tomorrow morning\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I thought as much.\\
No idea on my plan today. Scaffolding should be done “at some point” this afternoon.\\So no idea.\\I want to put a couple of bits up on eBay :loudly-crying-face: to sell. See what other things I might be able to sort in the rooms upstairs.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh brilliant, the super specific at some point time frame. Hope they come and get it quickly\\
Oh what are you putting on eBay? The printer?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Will put up one of the printers and I’ve got a heater controll thing that I will try and sell as well.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good luck.\\
I need to repost my blue thingy\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your afternoon been?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Its been ok, had real low energy today. Still no scaffold people which I think is the low energy.\\
I dont know why but I was compelled to but up a blind in the printer. Using a hammer drill after this morning hurt :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\Have just put up 3 things on ebay including the printer. So will see what happens. I probably have a lot of stuff I should try and sell. Help pay for the roof :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\How has your day been?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah sometimes we all have those days. But you're probably right that the waiting around has not helped. But well done for getting the other stuff done!\\
Haha, you probably do :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\It's been alright, very admin heavy but crossing bits of my to-do list.\\What time is Becky coming?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: gotta love the admin stuff.\\
I'm doing the 6pm Spin and Becky is doing some 6PM class. I'll shower and then head to hers after so I'll prob get there about 7:30 I guess.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I thought you were having dinner at yours\\
Oh good that you managed to get a spin in today :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah good to get a spin in and i'm signed up for the tomorrow evening one as well.\\
Are you seeing Michelle today?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No swim tonight, Michelle tomorrow\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: oh yeah, that was it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope you have a good spin and dinner\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thanks, you too\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: 100\% accurate.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It is :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ve got the raptor tomorrow if you wanted to visit\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oooooh, what time?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Has the scaffold been taken away?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: From 9:30.\\
It hadn’t when I left for spin so I’m guessing it will still be there but I hope not.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Mark's here so we had a chat already about raptor.\\
How's spin?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Took me a minute to work out how you would have seen my brother :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Spin was good. Not as good as Tam but much better than Joseph. Lots of changes though. Just about to leave for Becky’s.\\Hope you have \/ had a good swim.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: No surprise. Scaffolding is still here. :man-facepalming::loudly-crying-face::enraged-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Say hello to Becky for me.\\
Have a good dinner\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh booooooo\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Apparently the had a flat tyre so it will be tomorrow.\\

Nice evening. I’m not sure Becky is finding anyway to relax at all but she did have a good date yesterday that was a nice distraction\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x\\
Hope you slept well.\\I guess her way of coping is to keep busy which I get.\\I just got to the gym :sleeping-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00023131-GIF-2024-08-20-07-43-05.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh at least they've come. Hope it doesn't take them long to take it away\\
Why do I get so hot at the gym. Absolutely pouring\\I don't think I'll be able to come. I need to start work in half hour and I'm guessing she's being picked up around 4?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What were you going to update me on?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The gym is mega hot. It’s either stupid hot or freezing.\\
Scaffolding is done! Piece and quite now.\\Probably right on Lexi and I have spin at 6 so hopefully she is picked up early.\\The update was just on how the night went. Which I already sent.\\My parents have lexi all of next week so if you wanted to see her we could maybe do something on Monday.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah yay for scaffolding.\\
Do you have any plans except for looking closely at the raptor?\\Oh yes, would be nice to go for a coffee or something on Monday\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not really sure on plans today. Mainly raptor wrangling but might have a stab at putting down some of the bark chippings\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's a good plan, you do need a little bit of a chilled day\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m not sure how chilled it will be with puppy :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully a little chilled. How's the raptor\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Awww, did you go to hughenden?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, sat in the cafe at the moment. She is doing really well. Warmer than I thought.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It was raining on my way to the gym and so stuffy on the way back\\
Glad you're having a nice walk\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: She's so big :star-struck:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ve got the feeling it’s about to rain :cloud-with-rain:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your day been?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Been less chill than I hoped for. Had a 90 minute call with my friend Giles. He found out his wife was having an affair on Saturday! So his whole world just exploded. Nice to catch up but not what I was expecting at all.\\
I thought something had been up as he’d been less contact than normal. Full story on Thursday.\\Just got back from my parents. Took the furby and was helping dad try to get my nans old moped running. Just waiting for Mark now and will then head off to spin.\\How’s your day been?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh god. That is a bombshell. Poor Giles. Tell me about it on Thursday. Hope he's as well as he can be in such a shitty situation.\\
Did you manage to get the moped running?\\Give the Furby a cuddle for me.\\I'm just finishing up work and will head to Michelle for some blackberry picking\\Day's been alright. Still full of admin but managed to get through most of my list\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Moped didn’t start. We think it’s poor fuel quality. Dad’s draining the tank and will flush it with some new fuel and see if it goes.\\
Enjoy fruit picking.\\Isn’t all the work admin work?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, yeah but this is specifically admin :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Hope spin is good today. Same instructor as yesterday?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Should be a different instructor but we will see.\\
Lester’s BBQ thing on Sunday starts at 12 FYI\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki.\\
What time are we due to be at Ross's on Saturday?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Starts at 6\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki.\\
21 sept for dinner with Michelle and Adrian?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Seems free for me.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Brill!\\
How was spin?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Spin was good. A bit easy but good.\\
Yes I’ve seen those yogurts before\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Glad it was a good class.\\
What are you getting up to?\\I haven't seen them before\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just had dinner and about to shower. Then will be playing the new game with Matt.\\
Are you back home now?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just parked up.\\
Are you alright?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m ok. Why?\\
A little thrown by the news from Giles. Not what I was expecting at all. He doesn’t have the best support network where he is given they have just moved. Currently not sure the best way to help him.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just checking\\
I completely understand. Just make sure he knows you're there for him. Check in on him without obviously checking on him. If you send each other memes or something do that. I know you guys are different in dealing with things but just knowing there's someone thinking about you at that time makes a difference\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: In bed. Hope you're having a good evening\\

Finally turned into a bruise then. Hopefully it will be gone by the weekend.\\Do I know Maria? Hope you have fun.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I definitely remember snoozing my alarm today :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Hopefully but it's only just starting to get a green tinge so we'll see.\\You haven't met her - one of my colleagues from school.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I already hate painting :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no! What's been going on?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Prep work!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And realising that some of my walls aren’t that easy to reach\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah yes. That's the bugger. Have you washed your walls?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No they are not. I think that's why I've been procrastinating on my kitchen\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah washed, sanded and washed again.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh wow! Well done\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I completely forgot about that\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did you want to go?\\
I was thinking maybe just a dinner you and me as we'll have really social weekend?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha I was thinking the exact same thing.\\
It would be nice to try out but I’m not sure when we’d eat plus it would me mean we wouldn’t have any time just us this week. Which I would like.\\Plus you’re in the office so even without the food could be tight on time plus extra tired for you.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
We can always try it the next time.\\Btw, I went to Lidl yesterday and they didn't have the steaks so will pop in tomorrow again\\How's painting going?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: No steaks, wow.\\
Painting is done. Well first coat is and it never works doing the second coat on the same day. So at the moment it looks all patchy and crap as the paint dries. Will see what need touching up tomorrow.\\Nearly takes as long to clean everything as it does to paint.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know! Literally bare shelves. Thursday is new stock day so hopefully will get some.\\
Cleaning always takes so long. But well done for getting the first coat on :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\What time are you off out?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Meeting Chris at 5 so probably leaving at 4:30 and I’ll get petrol at the same time. Hoping to back for 7-7:30, as I’ll be hungry by then.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: When are you going out?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Where are you going?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll just drop stuff at home and go to the train station\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The keg. In bourne end.\\
Oh you’re getting the train. I thought you’d drive\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I thought too but I think the M40 is going to be dire at 5pm going into Ruislip\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was your evening?\\
I'm just about to drive home\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hey bubs. Everything okay?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: All good. Just been playing games with Matt.\\
Drinks with Chris were predictable\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you have a good time?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah okay :smiling-face:\\
What do you mean predictable?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah it was really nice to catch up with Maria. She's had a lot going on\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just same old shit with Chris. Didn't even bother asking about his relationship stuff as its all the same. Plus it will come out next Friday, so no point hearing it twice.\\
Glad you had a good time\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Next Friday?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: yeah. Chris and Ben are coming over for a BBQ\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah of course\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm in bed now.\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x\\
Did you sleep well?\\The bruise is bruising.\\I've decided to work from home because no one is in the office today so still in bed :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\EY well done! Hope you have a good session\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Slept ok. I at least remember hitting the snooze button today.\\
Oh that’s a good idea. No point being billy no mates in the office. I’m guessing that means you get a nap.\\Hannah was finally able to bully Toria into going to the gym so we are managing a session like we used to.\\The brain is so stupid. So much easier to go if someone else is going to be there.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah good! I'm glad you are managing to go and have got company :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did 10 minutes on the stairmaster. What a stupid machine\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh god. Well done. 10 minutes on stairmaster feels like an hour.\\
Did you have a good sesh?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah it was ok. Didn’t really feel like I did anything but was there nearly 90 minutes.\\
Good to get something done. It’s all moving.\\I’ve got 3 spin classes booked for next week :beaming-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's good to just go and do something.\\
Oh yay for next week then. Which ones?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Tam has 2 classes next week Monday and Thursday morning. At 6:45 though :loudly-crying-face::loudly-crying-face:\\
Then Tuesday evening.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yay tam is back. They will be good!\\
What's your plan for today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Super exciting day today. I’ve got washing to do, change and wash bed, paint kitchen and then put kitchen back together a bit, cook lunches.\\
All exciting house admin stuff.\\Then I get to see you :beaming-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\Any idea on timings for later?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That is a busy day!\\
But it will end up perfectly :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\6?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: 6 is good.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Will try for the steaks at lunch hopefully they'll have some\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Got steaks. How's your busy day going?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh well done. Earlier than I thought. Nap time?\\
2 loads of washing done. Kitchen painted. Just done a bit of cleaning. Not to put some of it back together and start on lunch.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: My meeting got cancelled and I need ti pick up meds so I'd thought I go now.\\
Well done!! You're getting through it. Can't wait to see the kitchen\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Will be interesting to see if you notice a difference :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully!\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: This one please :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Had a bit of a work emergency that needed dealing with. Just got to feed the cat and will be on my way x\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hooome\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done.\\
Fast potter. I might beat you to bed actually\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm trying!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: All tucked in\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Beat you :beaming-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
In bed now.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Damn\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Heheheheh\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
A bit of a tossy turny night for me.\\How about you?\\Oh I forgot about that :face-with-tears-of-joy: you definitely worked me over yesterday :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\What time do you have Hannah?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, glad I helped you forget then. You’ll get it sorted. It all gets sorted or it just waits for Tuesday.\\
Got Hannah at 7 so just leaving now.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nice and early! Enjoy the sesh, don't destroy your legs\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Erm, it’s leg day :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh nooooooo. You've got to switch that around\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: We only did circuits so legs aren’t totally ruined.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nice. How was it?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :hot-pepper::hot-pepper::hot-pepper::hot-pepper::hot-pepper::loudly-crying-face::loudly-crying-face::loudly-crying-face::loudly-crying-face:\\
I think I was sweating more than a spin class. Absolutely soaked.\\No excuses for park run tomorrow though.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well done for smashing it!\\
What's the plan for today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not too sure. A bit more a chill day I think. Want to sort my office a bit more and have got some mouse stuff I’d like to do.\\
I could do some gardening but might do that tomorrow.\\I was also thinking about painting the wall in my porch but that can wait as well.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Chill day sounds good, you haven't had a proper one this week.\\
It's only me and Michael in our side of the office :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, proper quiet office day then. Get them fires put out.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Running around assessment centre at the moment\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Any info from Katie?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No I haven't heard back. She tends to be a bit slower on text\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh amazing!\\
It's pretty full on!\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, there are a few breaks. More exams than I was expecting with them having an exam the day we get home from holiday so will have to see what can be done about that\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: but it is only 1 topic at a time which should be nice. I found it super hard to switch topics last year\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh we completely didn't take that into account :confused-face: sorry\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully it will also be more instructor led input\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: didn't have a timetable to worry about the holiday and i'd thought it would be marked assignments over exams. Has to be a way to get it sorted.\\
Worst case. We are back home at a reasonable time. I'll do it when we get back\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully you'll be able to defer it a couple days\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your day going?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: its going ok. I'm trying to get an old iMac I have working to see if it has any use. It is fighting me. Then I found a whole world of stuff released about uni so have been having a quick look at that. Will break for lunch now. The uni stuff has a lot to look at and I have loads of time to get going with it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: hows yours going?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Mental :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
I've just finished the assessment centre. The problem is being solved but different things needed from different people but everyone is working their socks off so hopefully we'll get it over the line by the end of the day. Very steep learning curve for me today :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sounds like a slightly chill day?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: learning is good. Hopefully it gets done or at least all your stuff gets done.\\
Its slightly chill but the uni stuff has made it less chill than it could have been. All needs to be done\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully the uni stuff goes well\/quick. What do you need to do?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I dont need to do anything yet. There is just a lot of bits to read and video's to watch. Its not super clear when these should be consumed\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Probably as pre-reading?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think its all the stuff we are meant to do in the induction week\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hmmm I don't know. They wouldn't release it now. Induction might only be the basics\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also, smashed my thing at work :partying-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: They have to release stuff a bit before the start so that you know but I’ll go through it before the induction week.\\
Oh yay. Well done :partying-face::partying-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00023282-GIF-2024-08-23-14-49-54.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I might have done a little air fist bump when it went through :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: well done. Good as well that you dont have to think about all weekend\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm very proud of myself tbh\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Always good when you overcome the first big thing at work. You will have learned a bunch as well. Plus you know you can do it now\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am absolutely pooped now, completely crashing off the adrenaline :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: nearly the end of the day and then you can have a calm evening\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Still need to go into town but after yes!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You've been getting up to much?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: nope, I've had lunch. I think this iMac works but is still doing an update. I forgot how long it takes to get hardware up and running\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: you seeing the girls or shopping\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: A bit of both\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I mean, I need to go to superdrug. Do you need anything?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i think i'm ok. I have no idea what i might even get from Superdrug\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Face and body things :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's the afternoon been?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s been ok. Not done a huge amount. A bit more uni admin. Did the mouse document I needed to for the group. A little bit of office tidying.\\
Just having dinner.\\You back home now?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Glad you had a little bit more of a chilled day.\\
What you're having?\\Yeah, home now. Didn't manage superdrug :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just chilli today.\\
How did you miss Superdrug. Too much chatting?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup, I only had like 10mins before it closed\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you doing anything tonight?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not really. Have said to Matt I’m about for games but I think him and Lester have gone into town. I don’t need 3 days in a row of drinking. Might just watch something but no clue what.\\
You having a bath?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I just made the mistake of looking at the forecast for tomorrow :loudly-crying-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s meant to rain from 1am\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, yeah we do have a busy weekend ahead\\
I'm sure there's a show or a film on your server thingy.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I saw that :disappointed-face: it's going to be miserable\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It will probably stop raining just at 9 but if it does rain all night the ground is going to be a pain.\\
At least it won’t be hot :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well that's definitely a positive way to think about it :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
It is supposed to rain all day\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did you find something to watch?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sort of. Just You Tube.\\
Did you get up to anything?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not really. Made dinner, did dishes and now just settled into bed with a book\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh nice. Apart from the dishes\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I kinda like doing them :woman-shrugging-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night x x x x x x x x x x x\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x\\
It looks miserable :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\Are you still doing parkrun?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I wanted to but it’s so crap outside\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: If you're going I'll go but let me know\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m just going to stand outside\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okay\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s doesn’t get any better outside :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:. Let’s pass on it. Ground will be very slippy and would be completely soaked through even before the end. Will be miserable.\\
Go to the gym instead. I’ll use my indoor bike\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okay bub. Might be nicer to do your big one next week when the weather is nicer.\\
I'll see you later :red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Next week might be a stretch with the guys staying over but would be nice for 50 to be a better day.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I didn't realise they were staying over. Whenever you do it, I'll be there.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just easier if they stay over. Ben is in berkhamstem and Chris is way to cheap for a taxi or to not drink.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh absolutely\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well it is miserable outside\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep. Standard British bank holiday weekend. Did you drown getting to the gym?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I absolutely did. Yuk!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did you get on the bike?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Heard from Katie.\\
Checked with John at work and he thinks we can do the annuity. I can’t as you need a long term care licence but I have a meeting with him to discuss it on Tuesday and find out how we do it. I can get some quote I think.\\Also, could you send me some pics of the spare bedroom bed\/frame for them?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I did 30 mins on the bike.\\
That great news from Katie. Thank her for me. Will be great to get some numbers.\\If she needs any info let me know. Nan is 94 and we are looking to either 100\% cover the care home fee’s. If that is an option or for the policy to pay out 80-90k a year.\\Will send pics when I go upstairs\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: This is where we can park tonight. Ross has sorted spaces with neighbours. 2 cars can park here. No risk of being blocked in\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Will let her know\\
I'm going to get some food and a nap :sleeping-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good plan. How was the gym?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I went upstairs and did the whole strength plan from Steph and some extra bits. I was alone and it was bliss\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It is nice when you get the gym to yourself.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It is. What are you up to this morning?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have no idea. Might have a stab at some tidying. The plan to do some garden work isn’t happening.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: \url{https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGe3tGaf1/}\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good that you admit your weird :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: How was the nap?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nap was lovely to start with but then it stopped raining and children started screeching\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your day been so far?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: When did it stop raining :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
It certainly did stop for long enough to be playing outside.\\Have really done nothing. Some bits on the computer. A tiny amount of tidying.  Brain blocked by he rain as I’d thought of doing gardening. Did try and test out an old Mac book I have but cannot find the charger. Has gone into the ether somewhere\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: For like half hour at 12.15 :face-with-rolling-eyes:\\
Sounds like a rainy Saturday. Sometimes we don't have to be productive.\\I'm going to jump in the shower and start getting ready\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I wasn’t even trying to be productive :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: just drifted.\\
Well done. You still aiming for 5ish?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Like 5.15ish? We don't need to be there until 6?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Correct\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I can drive to Ross’s (your car) if it helps save any spoons\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No I will be fine. But thank you :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Possible silly idea for tomorrow. Did you want to try and have a nap at my place before we go to Lesters? Timing wise it might work\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not a silly idea. But I will have to go home anyway to change if I'm coming to pick you up straight from swim :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just about to leave\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm home. Have a good night. Be good :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: Might a different one later but will see.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Would it be as enjoyable if it was faster?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: There are few too many things you have to do to unlock the stuff that the helps you build stuff faster. Feels like it artificially slows you down.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What is it called again?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Dyson sphere program. It’s a factory building game.\\
The bit I’m on at the moment is I need resources from another planet but I do have the tech to do this automatically but I need some of the resources from the other planet in order to unlock the tech. So you have to fly back and forth getting tiny bits before it will all click into place.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aaaaaaah!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've had a Google and it's such a delightfully nerdy game :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh yeah, it’s super nerdy.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m thinking you’ve fallen asleep somewhere.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I haven't! Just got into bed. Got sidetracked by looking at tattoos on Instagram :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But I will be going to sleep now.\\
Night night x x x x x x x x x x x x\\Hope you sleep well. Lay in tomorrow?\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night night x x x x x x x x x x x x\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
You had a proper lay in. Well done. Make sure you drink loads of water today and take a paracetamol.\\What's the plan?\\I woke up with a sore ear and a throat ache :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Once I get moving I’ll have a stab at yet more garden stuff as I think today will be the coolest of the week.\\
Then I have spin at 6.\\Oh no. Where has that come from?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think you're right, hot hot for the rest of the week .\\
Garden stuff sounds great! Take it easy though.\\I don't know :disappointed-face: maybe just run down\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s no good. The feeling run down bit. Maybe some sick people at the party.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Maybe. I am more prone to picking up stuff. After all, there were children involved :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I was more thinking Ross’s party but yes definitely the children’s fault.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: There was one there :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh yeah. Did you touch it? Never touch the children\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahahah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you up and about now?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just finishing up breakfast\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to give Katie your number, she needs to ask some bits about nan. Is that okay?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that looks amazing. Well done!!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just on my way to hospital\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done. Good luck. Hope you don’t have to wait long\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Me too\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hope the appointment goes well and is helpful.\\
I’ve not heard from Katie at all.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah it was alright\\
I thought she already called when she got back from town. She's just messaged they had a massive primer leaking in and out of the van emergency so were in tool station trying to get a cleaner. It must have happened as she was getting back\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Primer? Petrol?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Bitumen primer\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Out of Lee's van\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Right. More questions really. Will save for Wednesday. :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's all I know :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh no. That is negative fun to clean up\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: They leave for the airport in 2 hours\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: She just tried calling\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Spoke to her. All good.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Brill. Things sorted? <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: A path forward has been sorted at least.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well that's good\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I just finished meetings :upside-down-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :partying-face: for them being finished. I though you were having the afternoon off\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No, had to log back on\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just about to leave for spin. What time should I pick you up tomorrow for lake?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 5.30? And thank you for driving :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
Hope spin is good\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That works.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Back from spin.\\
So what happened at the hospital?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was spin?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: So basically because I'm a such a prefect little gym girly, there is nothing they can do for me. The physio was absolutely lovely and she really tried to help and did all the testing and questions and everything but I'm already doing everything I should be and more.\\
She made sure to mention pacing myself and maybe try acupuncture. And gave me some docs on sleep hygiene\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, a professional telling you to pace yourself :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Acupuncture could be interesting. Do any of your fibro friends talk about it?\\What is sleep hygiene?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't call me out like that :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Acupuncture could be a short term remedy like massage.\\
Btw, I saw an advert for EMDR therapy in Wycombe. Will have a look into it but it is spenny\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: But also a big well done for already doing all the stuff your meant to.\\
Remind me about EMDR? How much?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 110 for a session\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How rude!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh yes. Do they say how many session a person might need?\\
Private medical?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Doesn't say as depends on each person. But I will definitely contact them for initial information.\\
My medical doesn't cover therapy :pensive-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also, got a new symptom :partying-face:\\
Tmj\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: What’s TMJ and what the lovely new symptom?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: My whole face hurts. I'm trying to eat but negative fun\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Contact them and get the first one booked in. I’ll pay for it.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well that’s horrible.\\
Could it just be a cold?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You don't have to bub. I'll do it :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No, definitely tmj. It's very particular pain\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have a pattern theory.\\
I think there is a pattern when you have a late night followed by an early morning. The week after something happens\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's entirely possible\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: In bed!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What have you been up to this evening?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
Sleep well.\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ops, been playing games with Matt.\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
Tmj is better, no as much pain. Throat is still scratchy. But I woke up with a terrible UTI. I think my body is just breaking down at this point.\\Oh what did you dream about?\\What time do you have Hannah?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh god, just one thing swapped for another.\\
I have no idea what I was dreaming about. I never seem to be able to remember them. Which did used to annoy me until I heard about some people’s dreams. Probably best to not know.\\Got Hannah at 8.\\Do you need anything?\\You working from home?\\Is swimming a good idea?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Literally just a carousel of bullshit.\\
I only ever remember my dreams if I have a really deep nap.\\I'm alright, thank you\\No I'm from office today.\\I think it should be fine. I really want to go but if it gets worse I'll pass\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok, good luck in the office. Do you have extra drugs for a UTI the only thing I know is to drink cranberry juice.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've taken some ibuprofen and hopefully will just flush it out chugging water :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was gym?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was good. Arms ruined. As expected. Did under arm back rows. Everything felt very heavy today but I think it was all new weights as well.\\
How are you doing?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Under arm back rows? I don't know if I know those.\\
What are you getting up to today?\\I'm alright, plodding through :smiling-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: maybe I got the name wrong. Its back rows from the saferty bars on the squat rack with the Olympic bar but using an underhand grip. It was SUPER easy until the real weight was added :face-with-tears-of-joy: A real pain to use the wrist straps as well.\\
Not really sure on today. Just doing some email admin, got lunches to cook and its too hot for garden work \/ arms knackered. Think i'll go through some more of the uni stuff.\\Keep going but dont go mad. Let me know if you need to change swimming. It can always be done on Sunday \/ Monday and you have a late evening tomorrow and a busy day Saturday to think about.\\In hindsight I definitely should have arranged for my own travel back Sunday and perhaps swimming should have been Monday not Sunday.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yeah I think I know what you mean. What is real weight?\\
It's really stuffy and warm outside. Good idea to stay in the cool.\\No I'm taking it easy. I definitely want to go swimming :smiling-face:\\Oh Saturday got postponed because the little bub is not well - we could have a chilled garden afternoon\/evening?\\Oh don't worry about it. I was happy to pick you up\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: the real weight was 95kg. Will be 100 next time, which is much easier math.\\
That's a shame about Saturday but yes to us doing something :smiling-face-with-hearts:.\\I'll be getting rid of Chris and Ben early ish and then i'm going for a walk with Lester at 11 so the afternoon is free. The paddling pool is still there.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Omg that's so much! Well done\\
Oh nice. Where are you going for a walk?\\I'll probably do parkrun or gym an nap :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thanks. I think for normal back rows I’m over 100.\\
Just going to Hughenden for dog walk and a coffee.\\All good choices.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Swoon, you lovely, strong man :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
That sounds nice, weather should be still good\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm only just finishing meetings etc. can we make pick up at 5.45?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep, see you in a bit\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Leaving now\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okay\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sorry for delay, week got busy!\\
Potential options:-\\13th, 14th, 16th, 17th, 18th, 30th sep - 4th Oct\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Dates for dinner with James and Alex\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 4th October?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok, let’s go with that.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Am in bed!! :smiling-face-with-halo:\\
What was for dinner?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done. I’ll be there soon enough.\\
Dinner was the chicken I thought it was.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Eey well done\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm glad you came with me today :smiling-face:\\

It is :loudly-crying-face: I don't like it.\\:rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: I think only the throat is still there and remnants of the UTI :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\Did you sleep well?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Slept ok. I think I forgot how to :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: somehow managed to make my arm numb by sleeping on it.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha. You must have slept really deeply if that happened. Hope spin is good today\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Must have conked out.\\
Spin was good. Quads immediately took a day off as I sat on the bike.  Busiest Thursday spin all year.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I'm glad it was a good class. Well done for smashing it.\\
Hope today at Nan's house goes well\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thanks, going to be a shit day I think.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Why do you think?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s going to be longer than I want. No doubt a bit emotionally, probably more so for my dad. As we realise Nan and Grandad stuff is mostly crap. We are essentially taking 2 people’s whole lives and throwing most of it away.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I bet it will be emotional. Sending hugs\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Back at mum and dads now. Knackered. Skip full and still quite a lot of stuff left although I think all the skip stuff is done.\\
How’s the day been? You all set for your busy evening?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well done. How was it? Except knackering?\\
Day's been fine. As luck would have it my first thing got postponed so only the quiz tonight :partying-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just knackering. Slightly high emotions but not to bad. Just Grandar kept so much shit. Paint tins from 20 years ago etc\\
That’s a bit of a bonus then. Slightly easier day for you then.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How did dad take it all?\\
Are you doing anything tonight?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: He took it all ok. Needs to done. Some funny bits but sad bits as well as you realise how little they did with the last 10-15 years.\\
Not much tonight. Got a call at 8:30 with a couple of the robot guys to discuss a new group mouse design but that’s about it.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well done for getting it done. Big day for all of you.\\
It's good you have a chilled evening planned, I'm sure it's needed\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, just a long drawn out day really.\\
I’m home now just hunting for food. I don’t fancy what I’ve got and don’t have much inspiration in the freezer either so will just have to adult it.\\Chilled evening is needed. I’m hoping the call is short.\\Enjoy the quiz\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that's the worst! Did you want me to bring you something?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thanks you that’s really sweet but that’s ok. I’ve eaten what was in the fridge.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope the call is good and quick :red-heart:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We came 2nd on a Tie breaker <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh well done. I'm still on the call\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that's a long one. Is it good?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was good. Some good chats. I can see that I going to end up as one of the group members or something :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You home yet? I am now making my way to bed\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just got home and will be quickly pottering to bed\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: That so cute. Bouncy ears wins. GSD is probably the most sensible dog choice for me over the burner.\\

Slept ok, not bad not amazing. So normal I guess.\\Session was good. New sumo PB 2x3x190kg\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It is very cute :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\

Are you up to much today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Currently waiting for my shopping then speaking to Chris at 11.\\
Got to go shopping for the BBQ and tidy the house a little. Might have some time to tweak the design document for the robot club but will see.\\Are you out this evening?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I thought you’d like to know. I have missed you this week.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Quite a busy day for you!\\
Did your shopping arrive?\\Have fun pottering doing BBQ shopping\\Yes, I'm meeting Lisa in Beaconsfield at 7. Not out out, just dinner\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I would like to know very much :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\

They are going somewhere near Henley in the camper by the river and planning a lunch BBQ thing with Mark etc. don’t know start time yet.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. Do you want me to come with you on Sunday?\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: :red-heart:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: bit more brain dump. I know I am seeing your tomorrow (Yay). Not sure what you might have thought about for Sunday but there is a race on at 2pm that I would like to watch.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We could do something chilled Sunday and I did think there was a race this weekend :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We can work around it? Do a late morning and I'll leave you to enjoy vroom vroom\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: we can do that. Obviously you could watch vroom vroom if you like :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I might want a nap :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i had thought that\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was your BBQ shopping pottering? Did you get everything?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think so, might have got a smidge too much food but it is very much a boys BBQ :face-with-tears-of-joy:. Even got some coals. Have sort of cleaned the house. Tidied the garden and sorted out more firewood.\\
I might have to drain the paddling pool. I did find a dead bird in it today. How and why it died in there I have no idea\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Omg what???\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: yep, dead bird\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ewwwww\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What time are the boys coming?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Chris should be here in a moment. Early for once. Ben should be 6pm\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, getting the bird out of the water was NOT fun at all. Bin bag and gloves were used but I dont think we would want to sit in the water now\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope it's a good night for you :face-blowing-a-kiss:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No. Thank you for doing that though\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No I'm not. Will try gym if I wake up\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I bet :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Gym is a good idea, it was dead today. So you might be the only one.\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I love that :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Glad I didn’t do Bushy. Over 6000 runners and Cally has been waiting over an hour to finish\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are we pottering around the garden later?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: We can :loudly-crying-face: there is always something that can be done\\

I like to help you at home. Glad it's helpful.\\Is everything alright? I felt like there was something in the air tonight?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Everything is alright. I’m not entirely sure what happened in the bedroom. I know I fell asleep for some amount of time, which wasn’t done on purpose. You then seemed to completely shut down for an hour or so.\\
I also got the impression I’m not supporting you well enough if you murder group knows more than I do about the stuff your struggling with.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't know what happened, I just got pulled out of the mood and got a bit teary.\\
It wasn't on purpose, it just bubbled over when I got back from swimming (I remember now it was definitely wednesday) and I just told them. You could have asked me tonight when I told you?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You’re right, I could have asked and I probably should have. Like with the bedroom thing I got the impression you didn’t want to talk about as you didn’t say what you told them.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Bub I'd always rather you ask. I don't know what you want to know and what you don't\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not an excuse but I wasn’t on top form today. I do want to know about problems you’re having or things you are worrying about. You just need to say at the start if you want solutions or not.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know you were tired bub. And I'm not blaming you or anything. We'll do better for each other going forward :red-heart:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm all tucked in. And won't be setting an alarm. Hopefully I'll sleep.\\
Night night x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\Hope you sleep well and catch up on last night.\\I love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Always improving I guess.\\

Did you have a nice lay in?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00023670-GIF-2024-09-01-09-52-58.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's a nice lay in.\\
I woke up at 6 but then managed to fall back asleep at 7 so got another couple of hours.\\I'm a bit fragile. Will go do a food shop and then flat day.\\What about you?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s a good lie in and nap.\\
I’m sorry you’re not feeling right. Maybe try for a bath today as you said yesterday you haven’t had one for ages and they used to help you relax.\\I’m fine. I’ll start moving in a bit and see what I’ll get done today. Hopefully aim for some tidying\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah, I haven't slept in like this for ages.\\
That's a good idea. Hopefully when the flat is clean and tidy, the head will be too a little and bath will be relaxing\\Don't do too much. Sundays are for relaxing :relieved-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00023674-GIF-2024-09-01-10-07-38.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah yeah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm popping to Aldi in a min. Do you want me to pick you up some snacks?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thank you but I think I’m ok. I have a couple of things.\\
This is the quote I remember about weekends\\“Use the Weekend to Build the Life you Want, Instead of Trying to Escape the Life You Have”\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hah no I didn't\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Omg is so warm outside already\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, it’s going to be toasty today\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was vroom vroom?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was pretty good for a change. A surprising result. Bit boring middle bit but overall good.\\
How’s your day of chill going?\\Just playing some games now.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I'm glad it was better than expected.\\
I've done food shop. Cleaned the fridge and kitchen, bathroom, stripped the bed, 4 loads of laundry, hoovered and just making dinner now.\\What are you playing\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: oh wow. Your chill days are a lot different from mine :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: although I have run the washing machine and dishwasher and now you've said I'll strip the spare bed.\\
No explosions from the washing machine then?\\Been playing some of the new helldivers 2. Much more calm\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It was more of a keep busy day. I still need to put new sheets on.\\
Just had the greek Mac and cheese. I have some extra if you'd like some for lunch.\\I will go take a bath too\\Glad the game is a bit calmer :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: remaking the bed is so much worse.\\
Thank you but for some reason I have SOO much food in the fridge.\\It is better having a game that is more fun and less stressful to play. Just going to do dinner now with the left over BBQ plus putting out all the recycling.\\Will try for an early night tonight.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It is. But I am very quick at it.\\
Haha no worries.\\I'm hoping for an early night too. Need to get onto that bath!\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Are you bathing?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: image omitted\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
Well done. What have you put in the water?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: CBD bath salts\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Is that the first question that popped into your mind? :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Question yes. Thought no.\\
It was.\\Boobs. Yay.\\Then is was. Oh, you either look sad, tired or in pain or a combination of all three. followed by. That waters an odd colour for bubbles\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well glad it was Yay :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just tired and achy.\\
Hah yea, it's the orange salts so it looks like filth :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00023697-GIF-2024-09-01-20-53-34.mp4>\\

Are you on track for early night?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done.\\
I think so. Will head up in a bit. Trying to see if the tumbler dryer will finish first.

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
:rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: I love the GIFs :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\Yeah it's so warm here too. I was up before my alarm.\\What time is your sesh this morning?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Spin at 6:45 and then Hannah at 8.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yes your double Monday.\\
Hope they are both good! And you're not too broken\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Spin was good. Only slightly knackered. That extra 30 mins sleep that I missed makes all the difference. Let’s see what arms are like today.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well done!\\
I've decided to WFH today. Still full of cold :disappointed-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good plan. I thought you were WFH today. Got them mixed in my head.\\
Much better than spreading anything around the office\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Do you need anything?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't worry, me too :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
I'm all good, thank you :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Enjoy the gym\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Change of plan. I forgot we have a PT academy starting f2f this morning and I need to set up. And no one else is in :pensive-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Arms are completely ruined. That missing sleep has buggered me. Couldn’t do the full reps for overhead press at 62.5kg.\\
Oh poop. That’s a pain. Do you have to be in all day or just go and get it sorted and then home?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That is so much heavy :face-with-open-mouth: but well done on getting some reps in!\\
It is poop. And I'm not sure yet. Will have to see if anyone is actually in today\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think the fact that I lifted it might be a new PB but not sure.\\
Hopefully it not too bad for you.  No doubt you had other stuff in your mind to get done but just focus on what needs to be done and anything else is a bonus.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: On my way back :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: well done.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Amanda got in and just went go home\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well done on smashing the gym sesh. :flexed-biceps-light-skin-tone:\\
What's the plan for today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thanks.\\
Just about to get moving. Want to tidy the printer room a bit. Seeing parents after lunch.\\I’d like \/ need to do some more robot stuff. I’ve got to do a little presentation on the call on Thursday so need a couple of slides and to update my design document. Plus I’d like to try and get a new feature added to the robot. Think all of this will spill into tomorrow and Wednesday :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: A productive day for you!\\
Say hello to parentals for me :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\Just got back home\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Time for lunch and a nap :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 2 meetings before that\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00023725-GIF-2024-09-02-10-59-43.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: My laptop just restarted :loudly-crying-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: what do you mean?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It was one of those - we will restart now - and then did. Just needed some update\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: fun. Do you not switch your laptop off each day?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I do\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: that is strange then\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's all working now\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have some PTSD from people who would always sleep their laptop and then constantly complain that it was slow and shit.\\
Sleep just doesn't work on any version of windows they have ever made\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
Just got home from Mum’s\\How your day been?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was your afternoon with parents?\\
Day's been alright. Haven't gotten as much done as needed\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sounds like a normal corporate day.\\
I've done so much less than I had hoped to. Have done some uni stuff though.\\Parents are ok. More nan stuff really. Helped write out an email to see if we can get the council to actually hand over some money. Dad had a meeting with someone at the care home about moving Nan to a different room. Which will be in a couple of week. The raptor only woke up at 6:30 today so that's an improvement.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm still not used to that.\\
Would have been inset day today :grimacing-face:\\Hopefully the email will work. They are taking their sweet time with the monies.\\Why are they changing her room?\\Omg, amazing raptor sleeping time!\\What are you up to tonight?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Changing her room as she keeps complaining. To much noise, people moving about, Intruders in the night (which she is making up, they have sensors to know if people are moving around at night)\\
Going to be getting some food in a bit and then probably games. Body is knackered from double gym.\\Have you still got your call at 7?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah thought that might be it. Hopefully if she's in a quieter corner she might be more settled\\
I bet it is. You do need some proper rest days, with stretching etc\\What are you having for dinner? I still haven't figured mine out yet\\Yup, still got the call\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: She will just end up staying in her room but you can only lead a horse to water.\\
Dinner will be an omelette of Fridays BBQ food. Just to use it up.\\Your going to have cereal :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've run out and they didn't have any again yesterday :loudly-crying-face::loudly-crying-face::loudly-crying-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: dippy eggs then\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh my gawd\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Best idea!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: its that or any mac and cheese you have left\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I had Mac and cheese for lunch\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And probs will have to tomorrow too :upside-down-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: oh no, not the same food multiple days :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That would be the third day!!!!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Why do acts of service make you feel guilty?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Because I feel like I should be doing the service that the other person is doing.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But you deserve the service too :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think that is where the guilt comes from\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well I'll keep doing them and telling you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you want to do the moon swim\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
I'm so subtle :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well, not on this occasion. Shall I get tickets then?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh but I will have my first session with sue lord :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: There we go.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What time is that?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 6.30-7.30\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: On the plus side we just saved £40\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I wanted to go so much :loudly-crying-face::loudly-crying-face::loudly-crying-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: We can go on the Monday\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But it won't be a moonlight swim with BBQ and music :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well no but the moonlight bit will be pretty close and we could always have a speaker out\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, perfect\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How was your call?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It was alright. Just a discharge one\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: \url{https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGew2tQcj/}\\
What I was talking about with the lasagne bulbs\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh ok. We can try that\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I might work quite nicely\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How are the games going?\\

I'm still a bit coldy so had a mini lay in.\\Do you have spin again this morning?\\Yes, WFH again today :smiling-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good plan on the lie in.\\
No had Hannah this morning. Mixed it up this week. Got spin later.\\Did deadlifts and all went wrong.\\3x160kg no problem.\\Go for 200kg. Didn’t move, nearly fainted.\\Waited, tried again. Same thing. Didn’t move at all.\\Deload to 180kg which is “easy”. Barley moved.\\Deload again to 170kg. It tried to not moved. Got angry and did 3. Knackered :loudly-crying-face:\\Pain you still have that cold. That crept in out of nowhere. It’s summer. They should wait.\\Now for breakfast and then paperwork.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh how come you had her today?\\
Oh hun, it's probably because you did a double yesterday. You have to give your body some time to recoup.\\But 170 is still very heavy!\\I know. The absolute audacity. I need it to go now\\Oh what paperwork are you doing?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Amelia starts school this week so Hannah wanted to change stuff up for this week. Back to normal next week.\\
I know why. Just slightly frustrating. I did wake up this morning not feeling strong. Still strong.\\Got to make a flyer for an art show in November and for robot paper work to do for our call on Thursday. Basically the stuff I wanted to do yesterday\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You still having dinner with Petri later\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aaaah yes, back to school week.\\
I know it is bub. But sometimes there are not suuuuper strong days :smiling-face:\\Oh nice. What show is in November?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Probably just a coffee with Patri later. Need to text her\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: We have a 2 days art and craft show at the end of November in great missenden. I sort of forgot about it.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh cool! Look forward to visiting for a mooch\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How’s the day going?\\
Did we work out when we are seeing each other? Thursday and or Friday?\\On Thursday my call is at 8.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's been alright. Had a nap :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
We did say Thursday. I could probably be with you by 5.30ish\\I've booked myself for a relaxation evening on Fri 7-9 in Beaconsfield thinking it might shift me a little\\How's your day going?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s sounds good.\\
That’s very specific time to relax :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\Got the leaflet thing done and most of my robot document. Just needs a little bit more and then I can send it off.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha it's a guided workshop\\
Oh well done! Very productive :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Is this the embr thing or something else?\\
Do you want spam rice for dinner on Thursday?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No it's not the EMDR, that will not be relaxing in the slightest :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
I'll send you a link\\Are we going to have time for dinner on Thursday? If yes, then spam rice would be great\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Interesting, I hope it helps.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What else are we going to be doing if not dinner?\\

Yup, had a coffee in the front room and got home about 20 mins ago\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was good but not the easiest class given the abuse my legs have had recently. Defo rest day tomorrow.\\
That’s good. My brain takes a second to understand “the front room”\\You doing anything the rest of the evening?\\I’ll shower again when I get home, food and then have a go at getibg the robot to do something.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No, will just do dinner and potter. Probably read\\
What are you having for dinner?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think it’s chicken curry :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\

I can try some leg stretches.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sounds like a good Wednesday. I got to work at 745 and literally just stopped for 5 secs now :upside-down-face:\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh wow! That is a big book\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: A past student said it was the book they used the most so its justifies the stupid price for me. The other 3 books I've ordered combined cost less than this one :man-facepalming:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh lord. How much was it?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: £75\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah I was expecting more.\\
How's your day going?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Days going ok. Food is on. Robot has behaved, which is suspicious.\\
You can save making a cake. Dad wants me to pick one up from M\&S tomorrow that will serve 20 people. For Sunday.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: How are you doing?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well done on robot behaving.\\
Ah okay, no worries.\\Btw, apparently it's supposed to rain both sat and sun. Are there contingency plans?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm alright. A few meetings and now need to crack on with some bits\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. Was just wanting to do a quick walk with Katie in the morning so was wondering :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have you seen the rain? The pool party might have to move indoors\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: seen it! i can hear it :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: still a few days yet\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just got home. Will shower and head over\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok, yay.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Leaving now\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just leaving. Hope the call is good\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thank you for tidying\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just did a closing shift :beaming-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: All tucked in.\\
Thank you for tonight. I loved spending time with you even if it was shorter :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\Night night x x x x x x x x x x x\\Sleep well\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Me too, really nice seeing you.\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: your meant to be asleep :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Just today I was really reading your body language wrong\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Do you mean like pain etc?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Or that is was\/wasn't in the mood?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: yes to all\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's okay :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: I know you worry about me being in pain and stuff :red-heart:\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
Walk was lovely. Popped into lido and got a 3-month swim membership :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\Oh a late night for you. Did you sleep well after?\\What are you up to today?\\Yeah, I think I am. A bit outside of my comfort zone and all but we'll see how it goes :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Is work going to pay for that?\\
Slept ok, have woke up a bit “confused” maybe slept a little bit too long. Will shake it off.\\Not really sure on the day yet. Lots of bits I think. I really should sort out the printer room as it’s quite the mess and I need to use the maze but I also want to tidy the workshop  because that’s unusable. I do have all day. So we will see. Speaking to my friend Chris at 11 and hav shopping in an hour.\\It could be a little strange but you might as well try these things out.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh actually, yes it should. I  have about £200 on that benefit. Will need to figure out how to do that\\
You do have a whole day. You can just potter around and do bits. Not everything needs to be done today.\\I've got a call about mortgage cover thingy at 9.30\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Mortgage cover?\\
To ask a silly question. When are you going to go swimming? One lesson a week, 3 gym sessions, 1 swim?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You know the decreasing mortgage insurance\/critical illness cover\\
It's more instead of westhorpe for the winter.\\Hopefully 2 gyms and 2 swims. Swimming does feel good on the body tbh\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh yes, what insane price does it cost now?\\
Oh that’s manageable. You could swim at parkrun.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't know yet. They will send me quotes next week. The fibro definitely adds to the premium\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Happy to talk it through when you get the quote. Might be worth doing some boring math on how much the premium might make if you invest it instead.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
It's more that I'd like the flat to get paid off if I perish :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, but if that does happen who would get it?\\
Are you getting quotes for both? Perish only and one plus critical illness\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes I'm getting quotes for both.\\
And to answer the first question, I don't know\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Its a bit an of an odd thought but its what I do. Why pay money that you could use for something so that you can leave the flat to someone if you die.\\
All very morbid but its likely to be well over £100 a month for the policy. That £1200 a year that could be invested.\\Just a different angle\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's a fair enough thought.\\
I'll see what the quotes are. There's only so much I'd be able to afford monthly.\\And tbh, I'd like to think that in the future, if something happened to me, I would have someone to leave stuff to (not kids obvs)\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: its all very boring adult stuff but does need to be all thought about. You should make sure your teacher pension and JJ pension has the correct "next of kin" setup as that is binding and not changeable via a will.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: its probably more important for you to have a will setup now that I think about it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I know. I've thought about it a little but not properly\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Holiday is paid for :partying-face::partying-face:\\
£713.34 each\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Woo hoo\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you. I'll transfer you the money\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :man-facepalming: and success. Just spent 35 minutes on hold with student loan company. Finally actually spoke to someone. 90 seconds later. All fixed.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh wow. What was wrong?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: they denied my masters loan. The computer still thinks I;m doing undergrad and your not allowed a post grad and undergraduate loan at the same time\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oooooh\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Glad it's fixed :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: well it should be. Have to wait a week to find out.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also, just had my lunch. Thank you - it was so yum\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It will be\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: JUST!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I had a nap\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And then a meeting\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: oh ok\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: nap is good. Meeting bad, late lunch bad\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: what muppet books a meeting after lunch on a Friday. Some people\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: At 1pm!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: LUNCH time meeting. They can fuck right off\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahahahah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well in any case. Spam rice was super yum\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: any between between 12-2. NOPE\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: its so simple as well\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I've also tried for far longer than I should to phone up about our hotel but will try again next week. Trying to make sure we have 2 beds. We should but trying to make 100\% sure\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you :smiling-face-with-hearts: I really appreciate it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh, have found a different number\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: somehow got the motivation to sort things today\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: false alarm, same number that is the wrong one\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: weirdly I can't email them\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That is so bizarre\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh, I could try emailed the hotel. I was trying to just deal with BA\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hotel directly might be the easiest route\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: \url{https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGewW4DsR/}\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Any updates on tomorrow?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, update came through as you messaged. It’s still on.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Perfect timing. I don't think I'll be getting in the pool though\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Same. Either way the pool wouldn’t be talking with children about\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Doing parkrun tomorrow, yes?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah. Going to try and actually get there for 8:30. No idea how well I’ll run though.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's okay. It might be alternate course. Big ass tree blocking the path.\\
I'll come cheer you on\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh no. Not the alternate\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You'll be great whatever course\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What are you up to tonight?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Been tidying up the printer room and making up some maze walls. Forgot they take ages.\\
Will get some food and then not sure.\\Hope you relax thing is good tonight.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh what you're doing there?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've just arrived. Really hope it's good\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I was making walls. Its more the fact that you can now actually see some of the desk\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It is quite tidy! Well done\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Omg the thing is next week :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone::woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone::woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: good use of the word. Better that the other way round though\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: well it would be a bit weird just to stay there now\\

Have bot stopped since I got here.\\How's your morning going?\\The work thing is next week so no change. In the office today and quite possibly WFH the rest of the week\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Mornings going ok. Just had to reboot the house network and it takes ages.\\
That’s good about the Thame thing. So just book club today then. More manageable.\\Better WFH this week as well.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no. Why did it need a reboot?\\
And even better. Looks like bookclub is getting rescheduled too :beaming-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\I might actually be able to do some laundry\\What's your plan for today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Super boring but the internet was getting patchy. I think either the router or WiFi dispute being soft rebooted was out of memory. The DNS table was all screwed up.\\
I was hoping it would fix the light in the spare room as the switch works but it won’t connect to the network, which is weird as I’ve never had them fail before. Might have to reboot the switch :man-facepalming:\\Super exciting evening then :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: cheap electric today.\\Currently making maze walls and it takes forever. Has to be a cheaper and faster way. Then some more sorting I think. Spin later.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Very technical :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Hope it worked\\Omg I can't wait.\\Is the cheap Lecky during the day?\\Haha there probably is. Like cutting them out or something\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: cheap electric all day today for me and its free for the next hour but I dont really have anything to use.\\
Its the cutting of the foam board and then the vinyl that takes ages. Mainly the vinyl. We thought we could use some white backed MDF but its no good. Which would have been faster AND I could have just bought some.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh boo. Sounds like a pipply job. Hope you made some progress\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your afternoon been?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s zipped past and all I was doing was listen to an audio book and cutting foam board or vinyl :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:. Bloody maze has taken a day longer than planned but once it’s done it should be done forever.\\
Just got back from spin :hot-pepper::hot-face:.\\How was work and your now chill \/ potter evening?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh what are you listening to?\\
These kind of jobs always take longer than expected :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\So spin was good?\\Work was fine.

I'm glad you can feel it getting better :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\I know.

Have you done all your pottering\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Absolutely not done with pottering. Sat down when I got home so just put laundry on :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good evening so far.\\
I had a thought.\\As your WFH tomorrow. Do you have break time for a coffee or something? I could pop over to say hello?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's nice to be home tonight just pottering.\\
That is a brilliant thought. I'd love that.\\I will go to the gym before work but you could pop round at lunch?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: What time do you think? Any time will for me\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x x\\
How did you sleep?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Gym was good. Got some big pbs\\
Treadmill warmup 5 mins\\Stretch\\Squat\\3@60kg\\3@67.5kg\\3@77.5kg\\Good mornings\\10@30kg x3\\Deadlift\\3@67.5kg\\3@77.5kg\\3@87.5kg\\Glute bridge\\3@85kg\\3@97.5kg\\3@110kg\\Bench\\5@22.5kg\\5@27.5kg\\5@30kg\\Strict press\\5@20kg\\5@22.5kg\\5@25kg\\Run - 2.5k @ 28mins (couch to 5k)\\Stretch\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Holy shit. You did all that in one session!!! That’s amazing\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah, I don't have anyone to chat to :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: I don’t think I’ve ever mixed deadlifts and squats in the same session. They are normally the main event with lots of different things before and after\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I always tend to do the big compounds together I think.\\
What's the plan for the morning?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Breakfast and then I think I can actually run the mouse in the maze and see what does and doesn’t work. Then I get to see you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Productive morning. Hope the mouse runs well.\\
Look forward to seeing you\\But heads up, flat is a bit of state as haven't had the power to tidy yet\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m sure I’ll survive some stuff being around :beaming-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: On the way.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yay!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: All disposed of. They make it a real faff now. Because it was bathroom stuff you either have to pay or have a DIY permit. Some good idea somewhere they just causes pain. Easy enough to do though.\\
Have you eaten?\\Hope the migrain goes away soon.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you so much.\\
How much was it?\\Not yet. Just making food now.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Free in the end after 10 mins of getting DIY week pass rubbish.\\
I can imagine they get a lot of rage from people.\\Late for food.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you so much for sorting it out :purple-heart:\\
I know. Just had some bits to do and then calls. And I'm so slow today because of the bloody migraine\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just stick with rule 1\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am. I told Amanda I'll log off a bit earlier today\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: \url{https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGeKxR4vP/}\\
:rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\But the secret door :star-struck:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh god and all the books were colour coded\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I wouldn't do that. By series or genre\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I had a big nap\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done. Do you feel any better?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The migraine eased a bit so that's good.\\
How's your afternoon been?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that looks amazing! Well done\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Potters Arms-Sunday Menu.pdf • 1 page <attached: 00024135-Potters Arms-Sunday Menu.pdf>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Could you please pick your food for Sunday? Xx\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I thought we weren’t going?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't know how to lie\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: If I say we have to go to your parents will you remember and not dob me in when you speak to someone?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Of course\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: So you want to miss?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Why would I dob you in anyway?\\
I’ll go if you really want to. It’s your friend.\\I’d much prefer that your not completely before the start of the week and I do like not spending £100\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I missed the word broken\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Completely broken ….\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh just you might forget and say you were watching F1 :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Plus you didn’t seem all that keen anyway. Sit down meals are crap for socialising. Even worse in big groups\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have more tack than that\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha I know. I just hate cancelling stuff. Especially big\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I don’t see it as cancelling given we are doing the big thing on Saturday\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Okay. I'll cancel, you're going to your parents\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You best screen shot the message so I know what you’ve said. Might be making it more complicated but given my parents have been away all week it very plausible that I’d see them\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: As a side note that menu is very uninspiring\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: All done?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Your paired answer didn’t feel correct :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: just what the reality is\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No just starting the soup\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well I think I pavloved myself :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I do love an after shower\/bath all squeaky clean\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I meant regarding Sunday?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes I know :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: side quest\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sorted\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done. Main quest complete\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Veggies roasting in the oven. Hopefully all finished before bookclub.\\
Are you leaving soon?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Didn’t know you had book club today.\\
Been here a while now. Been taking a broken hard disk apart\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah it was supposed to be a double whammy this week\\
Oh fun times :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\Hope the evening is good. I'm just pottering to bed\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: How was book club?\\
We are just packing up.\\Had a good idea from Duncan on the new robot the group is designing. Will have to update stuff now :man-facepalming:\\It’s a great idea.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It was really nice.\\
Oh you'll have to tell me about the new idea tomorrow.\\Let me know you're home safe.\\I'm heading to bed so will say night night x x x x x x x x x x x\\Hope you get some rest before spin.\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Back home now.\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
How was spin?\\Head is better, it's still lingering in the back but better.\\Definitely autumn. I slept in leggings and have my big bathrobe on this morning\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Spin was good :hot-pepper:.\\
We can have a chill evening tonight although you will have to cut the chicken :loudly-crying-face:. I can cook everything.\\It’s trying to trick us though. It will be mega hot next week after everyone switches clothes.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Glad spin was good. Did you do gym too?\\
I will always cut the chicken, don't worry :face-blowing-a-kiss:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah gym’d. just got home. I was drawn to M\&S for a treat. £19 later :loudly-crying-face: got lunch for F1 on Sunday though.\\
Hope you have an easy day.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha you and your m\&s treat :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
What did you get for Sunday?\\Thank you. I'm just putting together a to do list and have 4 meetings in a row this morning :upside-down-face:\\What are you up to?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Got a thing of different meats and some chipsticks.\\
Going to get a coffee and food. House needs a tidy and then will do some mouse as it should all be setup now.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Do you need any shopping as I have an order arriving tomorrow morning.\\
Also in case I forget. Saturday. How far do you think we are walking? I’m 50\/50 on park run being a good idea or not\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Chipsticks? What are those?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you. I think I'm all good.\\
I'll bring you some soup today. It's yum\\Maybe about 4 miles ISH? There's not much info around tbh but I asked Agi if I'd be alright doing it and she said yes\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ooooh. I like those. Just not that flavour :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I might skip park run then.\\
That is the BEST flavour\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It is not :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The co-op salt and vinegar are much better. Pringle salt and vinegar are second\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You are lucky that I will never steal those from you :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s one of the relationship tricks. Like treats the other one doesn’t. Then they don’t get stolen.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Small change of plan for the day. Got to go back to tool station to get a new plug socket as one in my kitchen appears to have bust.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: All my fruits are safe :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh boooo. Did it blow?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: something went wrong with it. One of the switches was stuck on. All fixed now.\\
Although the fuse board in my house is odd. The switch to turn off the kitchen sockets is linked to the upstairs ones and not downstairs.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well done! Electrical DIY scares me\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: the socket was easy enough, lucky it was a straight swap. I cannot do lights, they are just magic. The wires never match up for some reason. The hardest bit was turning the electric off\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But you've done it!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you survived your meetings?\\
Any idea on timings for later?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Survived :smiling-face:\\
Shall we say 6?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done.\\
6 is good\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm leaving now but still need to stop in Argos and Sainsbury's.\\
Do we need anything?\\Should be just before 6\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: all I have is chicken and seasoning. No wraps. I think I have sour cream from a while ago and I have cheese.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I have the whole kit but was thinking about sauces. That sourcream probably won't be good anymore. We had fajitas so long ago\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Home!!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done.\\
Speed potter.\\Really enjoyed this evening.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Speed potter.\\
I had a really lovely time too\\Thank you for the flowers, they are gorgeous :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
Slept fine. A bit in and out.\\That is a funny dream but I'm sure there's some hidden meaning :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\What time is Hannah this morning?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It really felt like a waste of a dream I remembered :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
8am today. Have you gone to the gym?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope the gym sesh was good\\
No I didn't, had a sleep instead. I'm so cold today\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sleep is a good idea. You could always do a little after the swim on Sunday.\\
Gym was good. New squat PB 2x4x125kg\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It is very cold. Test the heating. You might have to shut a window :flushed-face::face-screaming-in-fear:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh amazing! That is brilliant PB :flexed-biceps-light-skin-tone::flexed-biceps-light-skin-tone: Well done\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh no! Shutting a window??\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What are you up to today?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well if you shut a window you might not be as cold.\\
Not really sure today. I should do a couple of house jobs. Currently waiting for shopping and talking to Chris at 11.\\I might try to do some mouse coding to see if I can make it go faster in straight lines.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: What are the timings for tomorrow?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But no fresh air :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Still a very productive day even though you'll be pottering\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll probably be with you at 12. Pick Laura up at 12.30. proceedings kick off at 1pm\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Other than swim shorts and walking trousers. Any thoughts of what else I should get \url{https://www.jacamo.co.uk/}\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am a little swamped with a deadline at the mo. But will definitely have a look a little later and let you know :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well today was horrendous\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: oh no. Why?\\
Soup was really good BTW\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just about to have my lunch\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: its dinner time\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Literally got up from my desk like 2x\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But switched it all off now\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your day been?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: my day has been calmer than that. Been churning through a few bitty jobs. Just working on a network upgrade for the house. I did manage a bath though\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: well timed for your relax thing to be tonight\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh amazing. Did you enjoy it?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes. Haven't even had a nap :upside-down-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The bath, yeah it was good.\\
What happened to rule\#1\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Today was just one of those overwhelming days\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: at least it is done now\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What are you up tonight?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have no idea. Will get some food in a bit. Currently trying to set something up for Uni to do with the new way they want us to write documents. Might play some games later or just watch something\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: is your thing 7-9?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh what way do they want you to write?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup, just about to leave soon\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You have to write them using LaTeX. which is a markup language. So I basically have to code my documents now rather than just create them in word :man-facepalming:\\
I think there is a lot of hatred for Microsoft in the science world so they seem to make things very hard\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh wow. That sounds very complicated\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It seems that way.\\
Hope your relax thing is good.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you!. Just got here and there are other women with yoga mats so hopefully I got the date right :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Are you relaxed?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha. Yes I am. Just parked at home. How was your evening?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: it was ok. Just watched TV. Was it good?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It was actually really nice. Proper guided relaxation\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That's good. Will you do it again?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think I might in a couple of months. It really did regulate my nervous system a bit\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I'm glad it was useful.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Me too. I was apprehensive\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I bet. Were there a lot of people?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Quite a few. Maybe 20\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But it was upstairs in Beaconsfield town hall so reasonably big room. We weren't squished at all\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ive pottered all the way to bed. Really hoping I'll sleep well tonight.\\

I actually slept ok. Woke up a bit before my alarm but managed a little nap after\\What did you end up doing?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s good. Relaxation helped then.\\
I was going through some of this LaTeX stuff, sorting out the network upgrade that blocks ads and then ordered some photo fridge magnets.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think it did.\\
Oh wow. You were really productive last night. What kind of fridge magnets did you order?\\I might have gone for a little c25k run with Katie :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You’ll have to wait and see in the magnets.\\
Of course you did :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: how far did you run?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Omg :face-screaming-in-fear: wait and seeeeeee?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Only did 3k\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: “Only”\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It was half hour chatty Jeff :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And yes wait and see. You have seen all of the photos before.\\
We don’t have very many photos together\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh are they of us? :smiling-face-with-hearts::smiling-face-with-hearts::smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep, and a few of lexi as you have to order 9\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: still going for 12?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm doing shorts and taking leggins and big coat for later\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: is it outside BBQ later?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: was thinking of running trousers with shorts for the hike thingy and take a change of clothes with jeans\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You could just do shorts?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: could do but will be gym shorts\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. Did you not want to do the dark blue ones?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I can, as long as we aren't going to be crawling through the mud\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't think we will?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly I don't know what we're doing\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i know even less than that :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We're going for comfy but cute :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Big eye stares. Like mother why have you abandoned me ones\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: poor spud. Only having access to inferior dry food\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know. I should call RSPCA on myself\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I assume he is happy now food has been provided\\

I woke up, assessed my broken body and decided it is better to rest. I'm still in bed\\How are you feeling?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good plan.\\
I’m ok. Mildly hungover but not too bad.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah that's good.\\
Bub I don't think I'll be able to come and supply coffee. I am in some lovely pain\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’d already assumed if you didn’t go swimming you wouldn’t be coming over.\\
Do you need anything?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you. I'm okay. I'm going to veg for a bit and then start slowly moving.\\
Any plans before F1?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Maybe get a bath going?\\
Not really sure. Will have a bit of breakfast. I’d like to do something but not sure what yet.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I will a bit later on\\
I do want to very slowly sort some bits in the flat first.\\Don't over do it bub :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I rarely over do it. It’s you that needs to learn that.\\
Just heard the almighty bang noise. Have just gone round the whole house. Nothing.\\Looked in the garden. *2* dead pigeons on my patio. WTF!\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh what??? What did they do? Stupid pigeons\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I did hear something earlier but I have no idea what the stupid birds were doing and I've no idea how 2 of them died. One went full speed into the side of the house. I really dont want to pick them up :face-vomiting::face-vomiting:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: \url{https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGeELAXgV/}\\
:eyes::eyes::eyes:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh god. Yeah I'd not want to pick them up either. Maybe a dustpan and straight into a bag?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Is that a hint :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not a subtle one :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i'll get a version prinnted\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I went back to bed and just woke up :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Was that not planned?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well it was planned in as much that I decide at half 11 to go back to bed :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your morning been?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Has the nap helped any with the broken body?\\
I managed to sort out the network change before th le race. Watched the race which has just finished. Not sure what is next. Need to sort out the green bin and dead pigeons.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not really. I'm just going to plod on through today.\\
Oh yes. It was an early race. How was it?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you taken any of your extra drugs?\\
Race was really good. Good battle for the win all the way to then end.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I have. see if they do anything\\
Oh good! Glad you had a good watch :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was your afternoon?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: its been ok. Just been sorting out a few organisation bits on the printer room. Sorted out the garden. Nothing super exciting.\\
Did the drugs do anything? Do you feel any better?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh well done for being productive today!\\
Did you manage the pigeons?\\I'm feeling a bit better but still fatigued and in pain as expected. Just taking it easy today\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I did manage the pigeons :face-vomiting::face-vomiting::face-vomiting::face-vomiting:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I really don't understand how there ended up being 2 dead ones\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: An omen\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Your welcome. Will be interesting to see if it holds up\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Can't wait to try it!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just remembered I have that craft show end of November. If you fancied making some things\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yes. I can think of couple of bits\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What are your thoughts for this week in terms of us seeing each other?\\
I’ve got dinner with Becky tomorrow. Will be doing spin on Tuesday.\\Wednesday is your swimming?\\I’m free Wednesday Thursday Friday and we have dinner on Saturday.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: My thoughts are that I would very much like to see you :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Shall we do dinner on Thursday? We could do something on Friday?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sounds like a plan\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't be so excited :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What would you like to do on Friday?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I am excited.\\
I have no idea for Friday. Will have a think.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Unless you have an idea\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't know. Can I leave you to plan something? :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll see what the brain can come up with.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: In bed . Could definitely do with an extra weekend day.\\
What's the schedule for first day of uni tomorrow?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m hoping for a bit of clarity on the work for the week but I have a quiz to go through. Will see what that’s like.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Night night x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
Hope you sleep ok and feel less broken in the morning. At least next weekend we only have a dinner and not a whole afternoon thing.\\Love You :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night x x x x x x x x x\\

Sweet dreams.\\Thank you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\Love you (lots) :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00024370-GIF-2024-09-16-06-45-25.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
Slightly less broken.\\Did you sleep well?\\Oh so you have spin, stair master and then Hannah this morning?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Felt like I slept fast last night. Just went to sleep and then the alarm went off.\\
No spin today because Tam is off to get an Xray. So the stairmaster is instead of.\\That’s good on the less broken but doesn’t sound like your at the normal baseline broken stage.\\You office or home today?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aaah okay. I thought you'd be very broken after the three things. 2 things is better.\\
No, not at baseline yet. I think I'm going to pull out of the work thing tomorrow\\I'm in the office today and tomorrow\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh yeah the thing in Thame.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah. It would just be too much.\\
How was stair master?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: The stair master is fucking horrible. I only managed 13 minutes and 3 was a cool down. Then the ski machine thing is just odd.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 13 minutes is great!\\
How was the rest of the session?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: session was good. Back rows was the main event. Arm's were and are absolutely  dead.\\
How is the office going?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh well done for smashing it!\\
Office is alright, just plodding along and so busy.\\What are you up to today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: keep plodding along. Have you got anything after work today?\\
I'm just working through and setting up uni stuff. There really isn't much to do this week which is a little frustrating. I'll have a go at learning some of this LaTeX stuff and see if I can message my tutor about the exam.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've got Liddy after work today.\\
I've cancelled going to Thame tomorrow\\Happy first day of master's degree :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\I'm sure you'll be able to do some pre-reading\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: that's a well timed Liddy appointment.\\
I've got some learning to do and there is some Maths course I need to go through.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Also, happy 10 months :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It is indeed. Very much in need today\\
Ah nice. It will get you back into the swing of things gently\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Happy 10 months :smiling-face-with-hearts: who would have guessed that you wouldn't be able to get rid of me :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I guess that’s a question to ask your friends :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Why mine?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: because its easier for you to contact your friends compared to mine. I thought it was just a funny thing to say\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't think I get it :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What time is Becky coming?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I'm expecting about 7. She is doing a 5:30 gym class. So maybe 7:30 actually\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: when do you get touched up?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: In half hour\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What are you cooking?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Curry, I put a slow cooker one on at lunch.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Any preferences for food this week? Could do a carbonara, steak, pizza, chick pea curry or spam. We need 2 choices\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh nice. You should make it for me sometime too :winking-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oooh carbonara :smiling-face-with-hearts::smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i will, you just wont eat it if its been in the freezer or the fridge\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: and the second choice?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hmm, chickpea curry or spam rice\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have you thought of something for Friday?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Nothing particularly exciting. Current thoughts are either sit in the garden with a fire and popcorn. If its isn't raining. OR we could try and watch something, again with popcorn.\\
Given that we are going out on Saturday\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I just want to spend some planned quality time with you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: DO either of those ideas sound ok then?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I have been very well touched up\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
That’s good. Do you feel better for it?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I do. Swear she has magic hands.\\
Say hello to Becky for me\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your evening been?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm just in bed.\\
Night night when you get there x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Evenings been nice, Becky just left. Poppy was a lunatic today :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: super bouncy for some reason.\\
Becky seems to be doing ok. She hasn’t been eating, so told her off a bit for that. Her new boyfriend seems to be going well.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hope you sleep well and feel better from all the touching.\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x x\\
I am broken :loudly-crying-face:\\Will do the team meeting f2f and then go WFH at lunch.\\Did you have a nice evening?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m sorry you’re still so broken. Good plan on the wfh this afternoon. Hope it helps.\\
Evening was nice. We should be able to sort out a double date. Becky gets a lot of self doubt at the start lf a relationship. She isn’t used to men being nice to her and it throws her off.\\I should get moving and find some work to do :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Actually I got told to do the meeting from home so am back :grinning-face-with-sweat:\\
Glad you had a good time.\\You'd be surprised how many people are like that. You surprised me at the start too.\\Definitely let's get a date in.\\Haha, what's the plan?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I am still amazed at how not nice people are and how others seem to like some aspects of it.\\
I’m assuming you mean you were suprised that I was (am)  nice?\\Don’t really have a plan yet. Think I’ll tackle the quiz and try writing it all up in this new latex thing.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: If you get a chance some thoughts on any clothes you think I need \url{https://www.jacamo.co.uk/}\\
Have found swim shorts, walking trousers and normal shorts\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: To be honest a lot of people don't know how to be with other people and treat them right.\\
Yes, I was surprised at how nice you were(are). :smiling-face:\\Oh good luck with the quiz\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've just finished the meeting and will have a nap. Another meeting this afternoon\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Could we maybe have a look together on Thursday?\\
I was only thinking that some linen shorts and a shirt might be comfy in hot weather\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah we can look on Thursday.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's the day going?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: slow, spent nearly 2 hours on the phone trying to sort my student loan. Made some progress :man-facepalming:\\
This LaTex stuff is interesting but also slow as its new.\\Did the nap help at all\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that's a pain. What did you sort out?\\
What is it exactly? Why can't you use word?\\A little but really struggled with waking up. Will have a very lazy evening.\\Do you have spin?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Annoyingly I was given the wrong information 10 days ago when I phoned. I need to get the OU to do a "change of circumstance" and basically say that I am finished. This then gets sent to the Studen Loans to show that I dont need an undergrad loan. THEN they can process my POST grad loan. I'll have to phone them again on Thursday to see.\\
I could use word but they want us to learn this new way. Well its not new it a way science article are written. Just a bit of a learning curve so I might as well suffer now so I can just do it that way as we get into the hard stuff.\\A very good plan to slow down a bit!\\Yep, got spin at 6. Hopefully will be good\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: SO Much simpler :loudly-crying-face::loudly-crying-face::loudly-crying-face::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Omg that looks so complicated! But well done for getting into it now and hopefully it will make going forward easier.\\
Any more news on schedule etc?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: nothing new on schedule. I have a intro meeting tomorrow at 2pm. Will see if that says anything. We should get a lot more information on Monday.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's good. Hopefully tomorrow will give you more info and in the meantime you can get a head start\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Spin was good. Really pushing it now.\\
Hope your finding some way to chill\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I'm glad you had a good session :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: As in a new pattern or a new way to relax?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: New pattern :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have made the mistake of starting “love is blind UK” :man-facepalming:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good luck.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh what :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Didn't realise you'd watch that\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Any good?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ve seen some of it. It’s interesting yet super slow and rage inducing. All the people I’ve seen so far all look pretty good. All the blokes are way above average but clearly they are all a bit mental \/ damaged. Very low emotional intelligence.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Misleading name for it then ey? <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well they don’t see each other but for a program that is focused around the person as a whole they all go to gym, work out etc. So it just seems a bit fake.\\
Well I think a lot of it is fake and people wouldn’t watch a right bunch of uggo’s\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha, a right bunch of uggos\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok, a couple of these people seem nice. Damn stupid program\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahahah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How do you mean your paired answer today?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What do you mean what do I mean?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: My answer is pretty much the same as yours\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think it's the I wanted to that confused my mushy brain\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok, I have no idea how this I reply to that.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't know either\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I guess it's a nice thing that you chose to\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok. That’s good. That was the intention.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sorry, I really have a fuzzy brain\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: This is brand new information :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Don't make fun of me. I'll cry :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've been so weepy today\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not making fun of. Just very gentle teasing. <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm still weepy :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m not sure what I can say about that. I’ll probably be too logical. Sometimes a good cry can help.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah. It's just because I'm poorly\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: At least you know that’s why\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Doesn't help :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have you gotten up to anything apart from Love is Blind?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No, stupid tv show has grabbed me. Going to try for a shower and then maybe play a game instead\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How’s the knitting going\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha. This is hilarious\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Crochet\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Knitting is easier to type\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: But it's not the same thing\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: My old guilty pleasure TV show that I used to watch if I was in a hotel was “don’t tell the bride”\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I used to watch that. Absolutely ridiculous\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep, sometimes good and most of the time a train wreck\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't know how any of the women actually married those man children\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know it was done for "entertainment" but used to boil my blood\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I was always confused by how little the women thought things would cost. Some of the men were beyond stupid.\\
Sky diving or water skiing just before the main event or forgetting simple stuff like food for the guests\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Terrible terrible tv\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Cheap tv\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: In bed. Exhausted even though I had a nap\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
I'm still fatigued and achey so WFH today again.\\Haha, I did think you went to bed a bit late. How are you feeling?\\Awww I didn't know you had the sausage today. How come?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: :smiling-face-with-hearts: sorry your still suffering so much. No more geocaching\\
A bit tired but otherwise ok. I think I slept on my shoulder funny yesterday which is still a bit stiff today.\\He normal goes to Matt’s on the odd day but there made is a building site and Lester and Laurie are both out so Lester asked. Hopefully he will be ok.\\You going to be ok for swimming later?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Definitely more geocaching, just not as long a day :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: but honestly I think it's just a culmination of a lot of busy weekends and weeks.\\
Oh what's happening at Matt's?\\Lenny will be absolutely fine, you are a perfect doggy day care :face-blowing-a-kiss:\\Yeah I think so. Will sneak a nap in at lunch\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Matt is having his bathroom and cloakroom redone so his whole house is a building site\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh wow, lots of work\\
Remember to send Lenny pics :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, he has started setting fire to money like he doesn’t want to retire in 10 years but the bathroom has needed doing for over 5 years\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :smiling-face-with-hearts::smiling-face-with-hearts::smiling-face-with-hearts::smiling-face-with-hearts: doggy\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Give him a cuddle for me\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I did already lose him :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah where?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: He was upstairs somewhere :man-shrugging:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How did he get upstairs with them little legs\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Bloody quietly is how\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Like a ninja\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Little sausage\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Awwwwwwwww\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good boys\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was the say with the sausage?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: he's been good. Only cries while I was eating. Just about to take him home now.\\
How's your day been? All set for swimming?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aw he's such a good boy.\\
Did you manage to get bits done?\\Day's been alright. Morning in compliance training, nap, then a lot of copy reviews, updates, referencing all afternoon. Just finished and had some soup.\\Will get ready for swimming soon\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah I got stuff done and the call that was this afternoon was quite helpful. Will just keep going  tomorrow.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I'm glad. What did you find out?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How the course is taught some more fine detail on the structure and how the exams work.\\
Should all click into place next week. Have asked for an extension but there is less issue now with my exam while we are on holiday. It runs for 48 hours from Friday lunch.\\Personally seems like a silly time for exams to be open but means I can do Sunday morning if I can’t get an extension\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that sounds really good.\\
Are you excited for it?\\I guess the exams are on weekends because most of those doing part time might also be working?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah it should be really good and I’m hoping the video lecture approach is much better than the “read the book” approach.\\
The exam times do and don’t make sense. Just feels like Friday evening out of all evenings would be the worse to pick as the prime time for an exam.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Monday or Tuesday evening would be weirdly better. Part time gives people the weekend.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We can have a little first week of Master's celebration on Saturday :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not on Friday?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: We have dinner on Saturday\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's what I was thinking but we can do Friday too :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh I see :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good luck with swimming.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you. Just leaving\\
What are you up to tonight?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hope it goes well. Enjoy.\\
Not sure. Might be playing games but 50\/50 Matt will bail due to jet lag.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It was super great. But I am fooooked\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Judy is doing it too\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I bet that makes it louder. What did she complain about?\\
Glad it was good.\\Extra drugs time?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, I went into the braver swimmers group so didn't hear much\\
Food shop and extra drugs.\\Are you playing games?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: braver swimmers. was that the actual name of the group. I mean you should be in that as you are quite happy in the middle of a lake, no wetsuit.\\
Just about to play my silly game. JetLag has killed Matt\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: good luck with shopping. hopefully the next few days can be calmer for you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well, implied :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: the ones that didn't need to be by the wall\\
I put my face in! And breathed out the air through my nose and swam swam swam :beaming-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I hope so too.\\
Enjoy your game.\\I am starving <This message was edited>\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done on the swim.\\
Swimming always make me hungry.\\Are you back home now?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yea, home and fed :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Pottered all the way to bed. Shattered.\\
Night night x x x x x x x x x x x x\\Sleep well\\Look forward to seeing you tomorrow\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done. Hope you sleep well.\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
I had a really bad sleep of a rotisserie chicken :sleeping-face:\\Hope the spin is good!\\Oh that's odd. Maybe you're just too excited? Or worried you'll oversleep?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I thinks it’s both :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:.\\
Oh that’s not good. Do we need to change the plan for tonight? If you need to zone out and rest.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No I'd really like to see you\\
How was spin?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok, we can get it simple and just do dinner if you like. You could have a bath at mine if that helps at all.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Dinner and chill sounds perfect. Do I need to bring anything?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just yourself. :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Are you up to much today?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Currently using the gym. Need to pick up a couple of bits shopping. Then breakfast. Got a couple of house jobs to do and then have stuff I can and need to do for uni. Should be a good day.\\
How many meetings have you got to survive today?\\Had the hammock made you rethink the standing desk?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It does sound like a productive day for you!\\
Well done on the gym\\I've got 3 meetings and then some really urgent bits to do.\\No not really. Or at least not in the flat - I really want a dining table\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: In the shrine of emptiness!!!\\
A wall or ceiling mounted clothes dryer could help as well.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: This new gym routine is definitely what I needed.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, dining table there. I'm not going to have two :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh what is the routine?\\
I'm glad it's helpful\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just these 3 spins. 2 Hannah plus my own weight and then maybe parkrun. Seems to be working well and the timings are currently very good. If I can get a Tuesday or Wednesday morning spin class instead of Tuesday evening then I’d be proper sorted\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yes. You're getting back into a routine. That's good :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Definitely getting stronger or at least back to strength. Seem “comfortable” back at 95kg on bench now\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that is amazing! Well done, you are working hard for it :flexed-biceps-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Need a new push to see if I can bench to 3x110kg so that I final beat Mark.\\
Then need squat to be 140kg\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You'll get there!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s an interesting thing about sibling rivalry. Mark recons he has benched 110 once. So I need to do 3 :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: only taken 42 years and I might beat my brother at some sort of physical sport.\\
Plus gets me close to the 1000 pound club.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Has he though?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: he claims he has once but pre covid. I need to get to 110 anyway as I dont know that I will ever squat 150 but if I can bench 110 and squat 145 i'll have done it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's a good goal to have :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You'll get to see the magnet photo's I ordered later. They are not what I expected. Poor research at midnight on my part. Have ordered more from somewhere else\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I can't wait to see them!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hows the day going\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Mental.\\
How's yours?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: bit slow, The work is relatively easy but the writing it down so that it will be usful in the future is the hard bit.\\
What time do you think you will be finished for the day or more specifically what time do you think you will get to mine?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've just finished. Need to jump in the shower and wash my hair. Hoping to be with you between 6 -6.15. does that work?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: that works\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Can I come in cosies?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: of course\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i meant to suggest that earlier but took mine off as it was too hot\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yeah\\
I haven't been outside, is it hot?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: it is very warm\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah okay\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Might be too warm for cosies then\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Home!\\
Thank you for the yummy dinner :smiling-face: and lending me the floaties. And a chilled evening :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You’re very welcome. Hope the floats help. The little for the legs was useless for me.\\
Hope you get some better sleep tonight.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm slowly pottering to bed.\\
Are you doing anything else tonight?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done.\\
Not really. Just watching a bit of TV and will try for an early night.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good plan.\\
What time is Hannah tomorrow?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: 8am tomorrow. So not a mega early start.\\
Not sure what I’ll be doing. Could be some horrible circuits or maybe sumos\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that's good. A mini lay in.\\
Well she always has a pleasant thing planned for Fridays so I'm sure it will be fun :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: All tucked in.\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x x\\
I slept lovely until about half 3 when the biggest loudest train went by super slowly cleaning the tracks and cutting trees.\\Did you sleep well?\\Hope the session is good!\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I thought the trains didn’t wake you up :loudly-crying-face:\\
That’s a real pain. Hopefully you can get a bit of a mini lie in over the weekend.\\Thought I slept well but full struggle getting out of bed.\\Session was all circuits and free weights :loudly-crying-face::loudly-crying-face:\\Think I’ve sweated more than a spin class :hot-pepper: higher weights though and Hannah has threatened to up the treadmill speed as well.\\How was the walk?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Normally they don't. But this was soooo loud, and at 3.30, slashing tree branches and grinding the tracks. Whole another train sound this.\\
Ewww circuits. But super well done on higher weights.\\Walk was lovely, just a gentle plod around the rye.\\Hope your call with Chris is good :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good luck with the day\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was lunch?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: At it now\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah enjoy!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: back home. Lunch was good. Surprisingly busy.\\
Day nearly done?\\You aiming for 6 again?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah good!\\
What did you have for lunch?\\Yes, hopefully won't be much past 4.\\Yes, let's say 6. If I manage earlier I'll let you know?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Had fish and chips. The lunch menu was long but not as good as the breakfast one.\\
Ok, just let me know\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Do I need to bring anything?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I dont think so. I dont have any garlic bread or pudding :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We don't need garlic bread for spam rice :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll be leaving soon if that works?\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
I just got home so missed it all by a bit. Did 30mins in the pool and 10 in sauna.\\Sorry you didn't sleep very well :pensive-face:\\Breakfast and helping dad this morning?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done on the swim.\\
Yeah that’s the plan. Then F1.\\What your plan for the rest of day?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I enjoyed it but had real trouble with breathing. Had to take a break to catch my breath every two lengths :confused-face:\\
Breakfast, nap. Tidy up and then crochet and bit of TV :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Are you breathing on every 2 or 3? I can’t do 3 without getting knackered so do every 2\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I was practicing with the float, I can't do the hands yet. I think I might be breathing or something\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ve not mastered it at all but your meant to just “breath normally” so exhale with face in water and in when you turn head. Instead of holding breath\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah, I am very much holding breath still. Will just need to work on it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just needs more practice. You’ll get it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Right, nap time. I'm knackered :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
I don't know if I'd be able to do a swim before work\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You just need to plan it out. Are you trying for day on day off in terms of exercise. Wednesday is fixed.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you, but I think I'll have to do a space saving one here\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Back home now. Took twice what it should have to get home :man-facepalming:\\
Snack all ready for vroom vroom\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah well done. Did you get everything you needed done?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think so. I was a bit annoyed as I’d said to dad 10am. He said no let’s do 10:30. I turn up and he’s done the job he said he wanted help with and had been there 50 minutes already.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh Phil :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: such a dad thing to do though\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was vroom vroom?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was ok. Top 3 were really spread out but some good fights through out.\\
How’s the afternoon going?\\I’m just playing some games now.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sounds like you're having a nice chilled afternoon :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
I've had a very chilled one too. Tidied up, laundry hoovered and just watching some TV and crocheting :old-woman-light-skin-tone:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: has been quite chill. Not sure how it is 7 already! Got to find something for dinner and got no enthusiasm at all for it.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The afternoon just ran away from me.\\
What did you find for dinner?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: How did it run away from you?\\
Just had a packet of the chicken I bought yesterday. Really wasn’t feeling cooking something.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I just sat crocheting and then it was half 7 :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Is that enough of a dinner?\\Are you okay? Just not feeling it today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You got into the flow of it the  today.\\
Yeah it’s enough. I had a fair amount for lunch \/ while watching the race.\\I’m ok. Had a bit of a stomach ache this morning but that’s gone now. Just didn’t fancy a massive cooked meal late in the day. Going to try for an early night as got a wave of tiredness this afternoon\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just haven't done it for so long, I missed it. And needed a couch day, at least for half of it.\\
Oh no, do you know what it might have been from?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Do you feel like you actually had a rest this weekend as I know you haven’t felt that for at least the last 2.\\
It’s from dinner yesterday. That sort of food is a lot richer than what tend to eat in the week.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I kinda do. It's been nice to have a more chilled time.\\
Oh I'm sorry bub. Hope it's passed today\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s good.\\
It happens. Should be fine by tomorrow. Back to more simple food.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: This week are we doing Tuesday, Friday and Saturday?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: \url{https://amzn.eu/d/c06xTYM}\\
Thoughts?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully it will be\\
Please please do let me know if wherever we are planning to eat is going to make your tummy ache next time :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That sounds good. I'll make the chickpea curry on Tue?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I didn’t expect it to give me a stomach ache and it could have been the slightly shit beer. It’s not consistent.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep that would be good.\\
I’ll shower after spin and come over. Hopefully 7:45 or a smidge earlier\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. But let me know if anything, I don't want you to feel poorly\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Brill. I forgot I have Steph on Tue. But that will be done at 6.30\\

I was a bit of a chicken too. I think it was the rain.\\Hope you're not too tired today.\\Oh boo about the ankle. Hope it's just stiff and nothing too bad.\\Enjoy the spin! Do you have Hannah straight after?\\Happy first proper day of uni! Hope it's a good one :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah just got to Titans. Will be knackered after I think.\\
Thank you. Should be a fun day.\\Are you home or office today \/ this week?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope the session is good and all your limbs come back home with you.\\
I'm hopefully on the usual schedule this week. So office today and tomorrow.\\It's absolutely disgusting outside. And to add to the car celebration of lights, the battery one came on for a bit as I was driving to work :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: What do you mean by the battery light? The stop start one? As the stop start will go on and off in relation to the charge of the battery. Your journey to the office isn’t very long so it makes sense it would disable itself\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No no - the actual battery light (I know what the stop\&start one is)\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is odd. When did it come on? As your driving normally or when you were pulling away?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: As I was driving normally. About half way to the office\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Was it on or flashing? See if it does it later. Was there a belt squeaking?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ll try and book in a Wednesday with my brother to get stuff looked at\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just on for about 10 seconds and then went off.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I have to be in the office on Wednesday as I have three assessment centres :pensive-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I didn’t mean this Wednesday. I meant a day when you’ll be at home.\\
If the belt slipped then that would make sense. It can indicate a low voltage from the alternator which will drop if the belt is squeaking\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I meant next week :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
The belt did squeak when we went to Ross's\/mike's?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It definitely squeezed once when I’ve been the care and it was when it was wet. Just see if it come on again. Alternators are easy to swap out if needed.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's probably that. The roads were so flooded this morning.\\
Thank you\\How was Hannah sesh? Have you started uni bits?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Session was good. New overhead press PB of 3x4x63.5kg\\
Just getting started now to see what going on with Uni.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh amazing!!\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Tell mum thank you for me please\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your afternoon been?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: its been ok. Been wading through what they released today which isn't the easiest to navigate. Currently working on some questions in prep for a tutorial tomorrow. Will be interesting to see what that is like.\\
How was work today? You all done now?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Is it loads and loads?\\
How are the questions for tomorrow?\\What time is the tutorial?\\Today has been busy but slightly productive. Yup just popped home to drop stuff and seeing Jenny for a bit then food shop\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: so many questions :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Its a lot of content they have released all at once but at first glance looks quite manageable to go through.\\I'm hoping i'm ahead by doing the questions for tomorrow as we might do the questions as part of the tutorial but they are ok. Second year undergrade level stuff so far.\\My tutor group for this term is 11:30-12:30 on Tuesdays. So a good time for me\\Have fun with Jenny\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh, I saw Laura posted something on facebook about a bed. Is she after a king sized bed? or I can just msg her on facebook\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh, it's about 1 or 2 bed flats\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha yes! I want to know all\\
That's a good plan to pre-work, can only help.\\Ah that's brilliant time. Do you only have one a week? Any like lectures or something?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It seems like there is one live tutorial each week. Actually 3 but all 3 are the same so you only need to go to one. Then everything else is pre recorded video's. There is the odd other drop in session but they are not consistent.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah okay. What do you think about that?\\
Just done food shop and on way home\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What are you up to tonight?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It seems like you get to talk to someone more often than with the OU so that should be good. Just need to see what happens over the next couple of weeks really.\\
Not sure about tonight. I've just done some organising of Raspberry Pi's. Will get food and see what I feel like.\\Are you going to be doing more crochet?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that's good.\\
Yeah you'll definitely get a better feel for it in a month or so. Especially after the first exam\\What did you organise it for\/as?\\I'm just getting some food and then will chill for an hour, maybe read\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I just did some cable management. One of them was stuck on top of the NAS, so not the safest. They all had their own power supply which was a bit of a waste. So I bought a case for one and a power supply that will power 4 at once.\\
Tidied up the network cables as well so it not quite a rats nest\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ooh well done! You've been super productive today :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: yeah, seems to have got stuff today. Which is nice. Just need to keep going\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Make sure you rest too\\

What uni bits do you have planned for today?\\A few meetings and then trying to fit some work bits in there. Then quickly home, Steph, shower, you, dinner, bake off\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ve got my tutorial and a few videos to watch.

\textbf{Paul Busby}: Do you want a sewing machine?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: As much as I'd love to say yes, there is absolutely no space to keep one\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thought as much. I’d say yes to it but have no real use for one\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was tutorial?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: it was fine. Nothing special. As usual not many people willing to speak. It will all ramp up next week. Got some good clarifications on how the assignments and exams work.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How did the rest of the day go? How are you finding the learning?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: its been ok. got some other jobs done. Not sure I can really comment on the learning yet as its all new but I like the idea that its presented over just reading a book. I'll have a look tomorrow at some more of the lecture video's and see how it all goes. Still going round and a round a bit on working out where and how to store information and getting used to the uni systems\\
Are you all done now. Ready for Steph :flexed-biceps::flexed-biceps:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It will take a couple of weeks to get used to all the new bits. But you're very good with organising yourself.\\
Done but definitely not ready. Just want a nap :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It will take a little while to get into a routine with it. Which I am looking forward to.\\
To late for a nap now :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: Exercise would be easier if it could be done while asleep. Are you going to be falling asleep during bake off now?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good. I'm glad you are.\\
No nap for me, I know\\Hopefully not. But post dinner, you never know\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Btw there's temporary traffic lights on my side if the plomer hill junction\\

No I didn't, actually woke up about half hour before it\\Glad you slept a bit better :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\What's the plan for today, apart from the pup?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Plan is more work. Either start on next week lectures and or keep learning about some of the new note tools. But will see what Betty is like.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I do have dad coming over at some point as well so that will be at least an hour\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good plan! Hope it all goes well.\\
Say hello to dad for me\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh Betty Boo\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How’s the day going?\\
I’ve been trying to think about Saturday. Did you say you wanted to do Parkrun?\\What time do you think we would have in the afternoon and was there anything you specifically wanted to do. It’s my last Saturday before our holiday.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I had a little nappy nap :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone: need to stop with these, I can never wake up properly on time.\\
I don't think I'd want to do parkrun this week as it's most probably going to be the alternate course. As we are doing the birthday on Sunday, we could just do dinner and a film or something?\\Do you need something doing on Saturday? It might be a good idea for me to hit the shops to get bits for the holiday\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's the day with the pup?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Do you think you need to try and get more sleep over night and drop the naps then?\\
We can do that for Saturday. Birthday stuff on Sunday wont be until the afternoon. Maybe 3 is the current time i have but that will probably change.\\I dont need anything done on Saturday its just a chance that we could have a chunk of time before our holiday. I also wasn't sure if it was the Marlow market or you wanted to go to the slovak shop.\\Betty is doing ok. Everynow and then she gets a bit whiney but otherwise she just sits and is quiet.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think I should try doing that during the work week. I'll still have my naps on a weekend :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
Sorry, I don't think I understood the initial message. I thought you meant it was your last Saturday so you needed to do bits. Do you mean last chance to have chunk of time together or for each of us to sort bits out?\\Marlow was last weekend and I haven't really decided on Slovak shop.\\What did you want to do?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: "Do you mean last chance to have chunk of time together or for each of us to sort bits out?"\\
Yes to both although I am not sure what we might need to sort. Anything that comes up that i need to sort can be done during the week.\\I really don't have any idea's. It was if you wanted to go somewhere or if there were some jobs you wanted to get done. Like furnature or painting\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I was just thinking that if we're doing Sunday, I'd need some time at home to just potter and sort bits out on Saturday\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Is that okay?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: yeah thats all fine. I was just trying to get an idea of timings for things. I should have asked a simpler question. On Saturday when are you free for us to spend time togther?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh!\\
Shall we do dinner and a film on Saturday? 5pm?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah that sounds good.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your day been? Did you get bits done?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: its been ok. Got stuff done and the first proper lecture done. Also splashed out and bought access to ChatGPT. Its pretty good at taking the transcripts and summarising stuff. Will keep going tomorrow. Seems like there is a lot of videos assigned to next week so getting a head start\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: how was work? You all set to swim in the rain?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah well done!\\
Yeah, chatgpt is good for loads of bits. We use transcript and meeting summary features at work\\Did dad come over?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Work was quiet in the morning and mental in the afternoon, only finished about 10mins ago.\\
I am not set at all but will go :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah Dad came over. I now have a box of wool for you.\\
It does seem very good at transcript work.\\Thats the day the wrong way round really. Busy morning quite afternoon would be better.\\Ready or not I hope the swimming is good\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh amazing. Thank you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know, I thought it was going to be quite a chilled day but alas :woman-shrugging-light-skin-tone:\\
What's your plan for tonight?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: i have no idea on tonight. Might get dinner in a bit and see if any inspiration takes me\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Omg you might potter :face-with-tears-of-joy: what's for dinner?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i think i have defrosted a chilli :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, so a surprise?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i guess. Its meat sauce and rice\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha nice!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've had a protein drink and will have to scoff down something when I get back\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: is that all you've had ALL DAY\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Nooooo\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I had breakfast and lunch\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: oh good\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Home from swim. It was really lovely.\\
But couldn't be bothered to change there so just took my cosie off and went home in my towel robe :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\What have you been up to?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: you drove home naked?\\
Not done much. Had dinner, watched a bit of TV. Just showered and about to try some computer stuff\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No, in my towel robe :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sounds like a nice chilled evening\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did you enjoy it?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: enjoy what?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Your evening\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: oh, it been ok. Feels like I should have done more.\\
Did you learn any new stuff in swimming?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Like you tell me...you don't always have to be productive :winking-face:\\
I did. We started with the arms. Swimming with the pool buoy\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: did you have to do any breathing stuff?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah but only breathing out the nose and then standing up to take a breath. I think we'll be doing the head turning next week\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: 3 lessons left?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well two this side of holiday\\

Well done for doing it! You've been absolutely smashing the gym\\:rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: That last sentence sounds almost threatening :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: One hour at a time I think. You can do it. Become a full day walker.\\
It always seems like the end of the year I start to make progress. Perhaps because I don’t have events getting in the way. Seems to be the pattern.\\It wasn’t meant to be threatening but I did think that after I sent it\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00024838-GIF-2024-09-26-08-21-25.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well this year it doesn't seem like you have a January that will take you out of action for a while so maybe you can keep with it?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is the plan. No back to back holidays or anything.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What's the plan for today?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: More uni work. Got shopping arriving and I’d like to get my hair cut. Got nerd group this evening.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sounds fun :beaming-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
You're all good?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: i think so. I might finally now stop buying a chocolate twist on a Thursday as I think it gave me a stomach ache today. So that's off the list.\\
Do you have any wild plans for your free evening tonight?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Think so?\\
Oh no! The betrayal :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: how was gym?\\Oh yes. I'll pop to Aldi, have some dinner, and crochet\\Rock'n'roll\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think i'm ok minus one stomach ache. Was just an unexpected question.\\
The gym was really good. I was and am knackered but bench felt easy to today. Which it hasn't for a long time. Quite comfortable 2x8x95kg\\didn't you shop the other day?\\Proper rock and roll evening.\\How about pizza for Saturday?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki, I'm glad you are.\\
Oh those are amazing sets :flexed-biceps-light-skin-tone:\\I did do a food shop last week on Wednesday yes :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\Yay pizza!\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: For some reason I thought you went shopping on Monday.\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope your uni work is going well\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Some uni work has happened. Have spent ages on the notes from the first lecture. Need to speed that up.\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: I left the house an hour ago. :loudly-crying-face:\\
I need to find a place I can book with\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh god. Where do you go now?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m trying the place up in Downley but this delay is making want to find a new place once this is done. Always seems I have to wait longer than the cut takes because you can’t book.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think that's the curse of men's haircuts. You very rarely can pre-book here\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's proper thundering!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yep the rain is mental\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh you sexy sexy man :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\

Any idea what time you’re aiming for tomorrow?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It will be good to get out :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: I'm sure you'll have a good, nerdy night. Have you had dinner?\\
Shall we say 6?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah I’ve had dinner. Was curry tonight.\\
6 works. When is steward picking up the thing?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not sure. He wanted 7 but I said I couldn't but was working from home so he said if he can he'll come get it during the day\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s Vague\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup :woman-shrugging-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did you do much after your sexy haircut?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did a small amount of work and then had dinner.\\
Never irritated that it pretty much took 2 hours to get my hair cut. Reenforces while I string it out all the time.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You all set for a chill evening?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's a long time. But it's done now\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Already started :smiling-face:\\

You’ve stayed up late?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, was finished up one of the headbands\\
Ah sorry it wasn't as good as usual. What did you do?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sat around and chatted really. I’m still not quite sure what these people do or what the intention of the club is. Didn’t help that I didn’t really have anything planned either. Need to plan better for next time.\\

Are you out and about this evening?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good luck with uni work. Hope the lectures are good.\\
I just have an eyebrow appointment but that's it\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your day been?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: been ok. Took a while to get going as admin stuff appeared. I have at least applied for my free council tax. Gone through a few lectures.\\
Are you all done now?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh what admin stuff were you doing?\\
Oh that's good! Not having to pay that is a nice perk.\\How were the lectures?\\Yes, finished past 4, went home and now out for the caterpillar care\\Are you up to much tonight?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: sorting out the council tax was a faff and had to poke around and then ask some question about paying for the course as my first student loan payment arrived today.\\
Lectures have been fine. Well presented. I think its information I did know before so its a nice refresh.\\Need to be doing robot stuff tonight. So will be having a go at that once ive had dinner. Going to do another lecture first\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: have fun at eyebrows\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It will be pain :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well done for doing all of that! It is a faff but all done now.\\
Do they not pay the tuition straight to uni?\\Glad you're enjoying the lectures so far\\What are you doing with the robot?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: For what can only be stupid reasons they don’t pay the uni for post grad stuff. They pay me and then I pay the uni. Like that some sort of better and easier system. Muppets.\\
Trying to get the robot to operate in a RUN mode. So when it knows the maze it’s it just focused on running to the goal area. The idea is that I want to work out where there are straights so that I can make the mouse speed up.\\In my mind it’s simple. But we will see.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah, that's bizarre . Is it sorted now?\\
That sounds interesting and complicated. I hope you manage to make it work :purple-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I don’t actually have a bill to pay the uni yet and won’t get one till next week. Total faff\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh, such a faff\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: image omitted\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: wow, your on a roll with making those\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well I've got enough yarn :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: there is space for more :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Always :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The car just broke my glass terrarium :upside-down-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I assume you mean cat? Which one\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yea\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The big bottle of plants I had in the living room\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00025025-GIF-2024-09-30-21-07-04.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It is. I was attached to it. Took literally 2 seconds and it was all over the floor :pensive-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :disappointed-face: i'm sorry.\\
Did you yell at him?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: No I didn't. It wouldn't help and I don't like doing that\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: it certainly wouldn't help\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just didn't want him to get cut\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: have you cleaned it all up?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup, swept and hoovered and torch searched :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i always hated it if glass broke with the dogs\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: full pottering\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Full pottering\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: He did look guilty\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: that's how they get you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i think my pet theory is becoming more true the more i think about it. Half the time they are great fun\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I mean he's got a brain of a toddler\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: toddlers do like to smash\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 75\% of the time it's great... The other 25 I clean up mess\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: 50\/50 might be wrong but even at 25\% its a lot of pain. Emotionally and finacially\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It is.\\
Still love the bugger though\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope robot work is going well.\\
I managed to get to bed\\Night night x x x x x x x x x x x\\Sleep tight.\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Only been writing new code for robot so its not had the chance to not work yet.

I forget, are you office today? All your days are busy :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\I’ve got a tutorial at 10, then it will be a mix of uni and mouse.

It's so cold\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You could. Could. Close windows and turn the heating on.\\

Crochet a blanket :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Are we still doing dinner and GBBO later?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahah, I might just do that. Silly work getting in the way\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: change of plan. That restaurant is fully booked due to a party so we need a new place. Any thoughts?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh noo\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: There is an Italian in Marlow , Liston court if going with the same theme, or the one in Beaconsfield we went for your birthday?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Marlow one is only open till 5pm. Beaconsfield one is also booked up. May have to change genre\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Until 5??? On a Friday?\\
There's always the Turkish. Or Botanist or Meghan's in Marlow.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: what about  The Coriander in Amersham?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: its an indian\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: although I can't check if they have a table yet as you need an account to book one :man-facepalming:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah Indian is good\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Today is kicking my absolute ass\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How so?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's just so mental busy\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was tutorial and uni work?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: it was ok, as always very few people chat. Not managed a huge amount of uni work yet. Been doing some mouse\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's the mouse stuff gone?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: its going ok. Suspiciously the new code I have written does seem to work. There seems to be a small compounding error. I think i'm reaching the speed limit of the hardware. After this weekend I want to start work on some new hardware for the mouse. Try to make a faster and more compact version\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh well done!\\
Don't be too surprised it's working, you are amazing\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: thank you. Its always suspicious when code works\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope stairmaster doesn't damage you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Only emotionally. Horrible machine.\\
AC was on low in spin so I look like I’ve just stood in the rain for an hour :hot-pepper::hot-pepper::hot-pepper:\\Just on way home to shower and will come over.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yay you survived!\\
I'll start cooking around half past\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: On the way\\

Thank you again for dinner. It was fun.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well done.\\

Will go in the bike this\\Morning and then I want to see if I can finish off this weeks uni work. Then it gives me time for more mouse before Saturday.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good plan!\\
How was the bike?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sweaty but done. Feels like I sweat more now.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's good, no? Just make sure you replenish fluids\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think so, it just means I need to drink even more.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes you do!\\
Good luck with uni stuff\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Random thought - do you need to order any drugs for holiday?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes i do. And have just done it - thank you for the reminder :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\

Uni is going ok. Pretty good drop in meeting but meant a late lunch.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm so happy you're having a good time with it so far :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am pooped\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I bet. You all done now?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: time to eat before swimming or after\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup, but tomorrow will be even crazier.\\
I'll eat after\\You almost done?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: at least you can have a chill evening tomorrow.\\
I was hoping to be but the calculations I'm doing are taking longer than I would like. As always. Will keep going until 6\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes!\\
Oh math is hard :pensive-face: hope you're making progress\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just getting to the lido. Have a good time at Duncan's\\

Only inhaled half the pool. That’s pretty good. I’m sure you weren’t useless. It’s all learning and practice.

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
It was a late one for you last night. Glad it was fun :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\How are you feeling?\\I don't think in recovered :face-with-tears-of-joy: woke up all coughing like 3 times in the night\\Hope spin is good!\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just feeling a bit tired at the moment. Will see what spin does.\\
You really inhaled the water then. Try not to drown the day after.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope spin was good. Are you also doing gym?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Spin was good :hot-pepper:\\
Completely full class.\\Just had coffee with Toria and now back at the gym :flexed-biceps:\\Good luck today. You got this.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh wow. Not having Joseph there really helps :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Oh how is she doing?\\Smash that gym sesh :face-blowing-a-kiss:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It really does.\\
She is doing well. Found out this week that baby will be a boy. Really enjoyed there holiday last week but can now see how crap her grandads memory has got. Still a relaxing week.\\I got peer pressured at the gym. I might have PB’d or matched an old one on bench.\\6@97.5 and then 8@100\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Got holiday money as well\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Glad she's well :relieved-face:\\
Haha, who peer pressured you?\\Amazing!:flexed-biceps-light-skin-tone::flexed-biceps-light-skin-tone: Well done\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I need to do that\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was some randoms who were using the bench. I worked in with them.\\
I think the coffee in between spin and going back to the gym helped as well.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Also this was released\\
\url{https://www.paperturn-view.com/rotary-clubs-of-marlow/santa-24-open-for-entries?pid=ODg8818818&v=14.17}\\It’s a Sunday. 1st Dec\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Do you fancy doing it?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah I was going to. My brother and his friends are doing it. Plus it’s just 5km\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I can get a cheap ticket to the Marlow 7 as well and not sure about doing that.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: When is that?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki, I'll get a ticket\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think it’s Sunday 3rd November\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think that one will be too much\/too hilly for me just yet\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It is very hilly. I wasn’t necessarily suggesting you do the Marlow 7 just wondering if should do it at all.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know you weren't, just explained why I didn't fancy it :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your day going?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The Rings of Saturn start at about 7000km above the Saturnian “surface” and extend\\
out to about 80,000km. Given that the average density of Saturn is 687 kg m−3 and\\its equatorial radius is 60,300 km, calculate the density of a moon that would just\\avoid tidal disruption (a) at the innermost ring and (b) at the outermost ring. You\\should use a value of 2.5 for the scaling factor in the Roche Limit equation as this is\\more realistic than the 1.3 given by the simple assumptions in the lecture.\\Comment on how these compare to the typical density of a Moon of Saturn.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I really hate rearranging formula's\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :exploding-head::exploding-head::exploding-head::exploding-head::exploding-head::exploding-head:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Trying to get this question and the last one done before lunch. Then uni is done for the week\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah well done! Good luck :four-leaf-clover:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Apparently a X.90 class solar flare has occurred today\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: OH, will be googling that now. The lights are all still on so that's a good start\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh what do you mean about the lights?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: it hasn't taken out the power grid so we are still safe\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh is that like the worst case scenario?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: worst case is that it kills everything in it path due to very high radiation. Next worst case it that is just destroys equipment. The power grid would sort of explode as it absorbs more energy than it is designed for. Satellites would get damaged or destroyed if they are in the wrong place.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah well good that it didn't happen :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your day been?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: its been ok. Starting to flag a bit but uni is done. Testing out some mouse stuff.\\
How was yours? Are you all done now?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah well done on getting the uni stuff done!\\
How's the mouse stuff going?\\I've been racking my brain for the last few hours - did you tell me you were doing something tonight?\\I am doubly pooped and in pain. It was a very busy day\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: The mouse is going ok. There is a issue that I cannot quite work out. It still works but it "bounces" hard to explain and i'm not sure why it does it. Keep having idea that aren't right.\\
I'm sorry, you've had a busy few days and not much rest over the last week. Bath time?\\I have a robot call tonight at 8pm. Its remote.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I wish I could help you with that :pensive-face:\\
Definitely a food and crochet night. I'll go to the gym in the morning to get some intentional movement in. I've racked up 12.5k steps each day :grinning-face-with-sweat:\\Ah yes! I knew it was something robot related\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I know you do. I think the issue is deep in the code somewhere. Some race condition maybe. I've just recreated the issue which might give a bit of a hint. I need to be able to dump out more data to see whats happening. From yesterday there was a theory that it could be an inertia problem but I can replicate it with the robot free running on a stand. Which points to a code something.\\
This competition will be the last one for this mouse. I want to build a new one that should be faster, more efficient.\\That insane steps for the last 2 days. Well done. No wonder the brokenness kicked in. Sounds like a good plan to be making things\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It sounds complicated. Hopefully whatever you are doing is going to shed some light and offer ideas\\
It is. My legs feel like they are going to fall off. Definitely taking some extra drugs tonight\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: quite a bit of forward planning for my robot competitions next year\\
2025 Dates\\April 5th - 1 day\\June 21st and 22nd\\July 26th and 27th\\October 4th\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll put it in the calendar :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
Having a good call?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Its ok. Just a lot of admin stuff at the moment\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Is it going to be a late one?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i hope not as i'm knackered today. How is the crochet going\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I finished the headband and one scrunchie :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: will potter to bed now\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: In bed. Hope you'll get to go soon too.\\

Not on the peeing yourself but on the set. Another insane set.\\
Morning has been good. Mouse seems to work. So that’s good.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am so so sorry. I switched off my alarm and just woke up. I am going to potter very very quickly to get ready and will be up as soon after 1.30 as I can. Are you easy to find?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s ok. I wasn’t expecting you until 2 anyway.\\
Yes easy to find. You park in a pay and display or on the road. You will signs for Smiffy cafe. We are in that.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah good ! Do you know what time you might be doing the competition?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It should kick off at 2 but we are running a little late and I don’t know what order I’ll run in but probably in the first half\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I thought it was 1.30. I'll aim for 2 then\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Is the competition finished? What place did you get?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just about to head home.\\
I’m actually not sure. Wasn’t last but not sure if I was second or third from last\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh you finished earlier than you expected.\\
Did you enjoy the day?\\I really enjoyed watching the manly mouse :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Packing up didn’t take very long in the end as lots of people were helping.\\
Just got home. Knackered now.\\Really good day. Goes super fast. It’s a good energy in the room and everyone is so smart.\\Really enjoyed you being there as well. Hopefully gives a better picture of what I’ve been rambling about.\\Have you shopped?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah that's good.\\
Have you figured out dinner yet?\\Hopefully you have a chilled evening ahead. No mouse stuff please :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\I have shopped, just pottering at home\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not sorted dinner yet. I’d thought about buying something on the way back but we finished early. I have some sort of chicken and something in the freezer that will do.\\
Ha, I was thinking of trying some mouse stuff but will see.\\That’s good. You can chill now. Are you swimming in the morning?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. Hope it's nice :smiling-face:\\
Give your brain a break :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\Yeah I'm just pottering around, laundry etc. and will make soup so can give you some tomorrow.\\I won't swim tomorrow, there's just too many things to do and I do want a lay in\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Lay in is a good idea.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What have you been up to?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not much. Had dinner, did some washing, bit of a kitchen clean and have been watching tv.\\
How’s your evening been?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good, sounds like a more chilled evening for you. I did pretty much the same with an addition of some crochet\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh nice.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you worked out what your plans are for tomorrow?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Probably what I told you earlier. Nails, then go into town, get monies and maybe couple other bits.\\
What is your plan?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not really sure. Might suggest to my mum that I drop in to see her and dad on Wednesday on my way back from an art show meeting. I’m sure I’ve got a couple of house job to sort and then I’m not sure.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Would you like to see each other?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I would if you have the time and it not going to mess anything up for you in terms of holiday prep. Otherwise I don’t think we will see each other until Saturday morning.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well I would love to see you. I miss you.\\
Shall I let you know how the day is going and if we both can we can at least have a coffee or something?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That would be nice. None of my day is fixed so just let me know. I could always meet you in town if that’s the easiest.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki sounds good.\\
I'm pottering to bed finally. You really stitched me up with The Resident :face-with-tears-of-joy: can't stop watching.\\Night night x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\Sleep well.\\Well done on today, you were amazing.\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, that’s what’s I’ve been watching as well :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:.\\

How did you sleep?\\I turned up at the nail place an hour early because Google says they open at 9 when in fact they open at 10 :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Morning x  x x x x x x\\
That’s annoying. Do they open at 9 during the week? They might never have updated their google entry. What are you doing now as I’m guessing nothing is open?\\Slept ok. Just got up but am still in bed.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Glad that you had a lay in. Feeling okay?\\
Yes they do.\\I'm just sitting in the car waiting, scrolling\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m ok. Just being slow this morning.\\
Have fun at the nail salon.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You should come with me next time\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Erm, sounds horrifying :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: and painful.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's neither :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy: what do you think they are doing to me?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have no idea but I can’t even take my nails being filed\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Maybe I can do you a home one?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It is quite relaxing\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: We can try\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to go to superdrug\/boots after\\
Do you need any bits for holiday?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I probably need some sun cream. I normally get the nivia kids factor 50\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki I'll get you some. Anything else?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Can’t think of anything else\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: that will work but it used to be in a blue bottle\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Got the blue one off Amazon as 8 quid cheaper :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Didn't get money as it's closed because they don't have staff. There are too many people and I'm flagging. I need to pop to Katie to pick some clothes up. Then will need to eat.\\
Would it be okay if I popped around 4.30ish for a cuppa?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: that's annoying about the money. Good luck with clothes\\
4:30 works for me.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you get everything else that you wanted?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I can come to you if you like?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Would you?\\
I really need to get home to eat something and have a little nap\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: of course if that is easier. I'll come to you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you. Can we do 5? I can make you a beige dinner :winking-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: you we can do 5. DO you want to confirm after you wake from your nap\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Definitely 5! I don't want to nap too long :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: ok, I know you dont want to nap for long...\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm up!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: And not crying?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Mainly :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: On the way\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Home.\\
Got to speed potter some house jobs.\\Thank you again for dinner\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh what jobs?\\
So welcome. Thank you for coming over and spending some time together :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Bins, protein shake and breakfast for tomorrow.\\

I did sleep okay, just woke up before the alarm.\\Yup, office today. I feel it will be full on\\Hope spin is good :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Spin was good. Nice and busy.\\
Gym was good as well. Back up to 100kg bench 2x5x100.\\Now having breakfast and a sit down :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\Hope the office goes well.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Amazing! Well done :flexed-biceps-light-skin-tone:\\
What's the plan after the sit down?\\Office is mental\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: A very quick bit of robot but most of today will be uni work. Want to try and blast through this week today and tomorrow.\\
Why is the office so mental today?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good luck with uni work. Are you trying to do 2 weeks' worth?\\
It's just a lot of stuff at the same time\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That was the plan but got lucky with when holiday is as next week is just a revision week. So I can get that setup this week and do some revision next week. There isn’t any new material to consume.\\
Did you order sun cream off Amazon or do I need to? Just remembered about it\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good luck with the day. You’ll get it done. One bit at a time until home time.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah that's good!\\
Yes I ordered it, coming today :slightly-smiling-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha brilliant! Thank you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your day been?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: its been ok. Slower than I would have liked. Just about to get food.\\
How's yours been? You at home now ready for book club\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did you get bits done?\\
It's been very overwhelming. Million things coming constantly :upside-down-face:\\Yup, home and then off out for book club :loudly-crying-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ve got bits done. Just that little bit more tired than I would like for the brain to be optimum.\\
You’ll get the work stuff done. Just keep plugging away. You always sorted out all the teaching stuff.\\Oh your out out for book club. Late night then tonight?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You did have a busy, exhausting morning bub. Early night tonight?\\
I hope so. I definitely feel like I'm treading water at the moment.\\Yup. I'm going to try not to stay too late.\\What are you up to tonight?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Planning for an early night and I don’t have an early start so that’s good.\\
Not really sure on tonight maybe one sort of robot stuff as had a few thoughts to test out since Saturday.\\Have fun at book club.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Home!\\
How's your evening been? Did you get to test out some robot bits?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Evenings been good. Been doing some robot stuff. Have found a way to make the current one faster with some code changes. Still not sure what has to change to get more speed in the corners but I thing I need to make the robot a bit more robust and lighter as well.\\
How was book worming?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that's good progress. Well done :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
Book worming was good. But I'm already in bed which is even better :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to say night night now x x x x x x x x x x x x\\

How did you sleep? Better I hope\\It's been mental since the moment I stepped in :upside-down-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I slept ok.\\
Oh dear, I guess it helps the time go fast when it’s busy.\\Just had food arrive so about to start the day. Got a tutorial at 11:30, so that should be interesting. Trying to finish all of this weeks lectures today so I can do the tutorial work tomorrow and Thursday.\\Do you still have Steph later?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope the tutorial and uni work go well today.\\
No, I've cancelled. I'm in quite a bit of pain and don't want to make it worse\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: :smiling-face-with-hearts: sounds like a good idea. Do you still have book club?\\
Hopefully next week can be a bit of a reset for you.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes I do but it's from home so at least that.\\
I really hope so. It's been a lot :grinning-face-with-sweat:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I thought todays was a remote book club.\\
There will be something wrong if you can't relax on holiday with no commitments to worry about :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Today is remote, that's why it's from home :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
How was tutorial?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: sorry that is what I meant :man-facepalming:. Its good that you can do it from home.\\
Tutorial was good. I did most of it correctly, some silly mistakes which I can now avoid. Now to hunt for lunch\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah well done! I'm glad it's going well.\\
I am a bit non stop here\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Remember to drink and take a break for lunch.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've just had a wrap and taking 5mins outside :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Awwwwwwww :smiling-face-with-hearts: thank you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Why does paper work take so long to get nothing done. Trying to pay the uni money is a real pain. Currently by bill for the whole year is about £2k less than I was expecting. Which is good but I dont need extra money from the student loan company.\\
Hope your day got \/ gets calmer\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Santa run also paid for now. I have Eva that weekend so maybe she will have to do it as well :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that's bizarre. Have you figured out why the figures are different?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I still need to do that or I can have Eva!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Up to you. You make loads of friends if you have Eva with you\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No idea why its different. Have emailed to ask but they haven't got back to me yet.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Would you leave her at home?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Wonder what they'll say\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just parked up. Got a blooming headache. Cannot wait for a little lay in tomorrow\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I can leave her at home if needed or I could run it with her :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:. Would be chaos.\\
well done. Speed rest before book worming. Lay in is always good.\\I'm just about to get ready for the gym. Hit the stair master before spin :loudly-crying-face::loudly-crying-face::loudly-crying-face::loudly-crying-face::loudly-crying-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: If she behaves for me I'd happily take her :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: Eva behaves pretty much all the time and she is really good out and about in towns. She just attracts crowds of people\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki I'll have her :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I might have to keep that quiet or you could end up with Lexi as well :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Stair master and spin done. :hot-pepper::hot-pepper::hot-pepper::hot-pepper::loudly-crying-face::loudly-crying-face::loudly-crying-face::loudly-crying-face:.

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yes, just the one please :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
Fantastic! Well done. Glad you had a good sesh. Shower and food now?\\Book worming doesn't start until 8 :sleeping-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh maaaaaaaaaan, nap on the plane\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Doing food first so I only have to walk upstairs once :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Should have done the later flight I think but we will see.\\Sleep on the plane is good.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha, good plan!\\
What did you have for dins?\\Ah it will be fine - we'll have a week to relax and rest\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Dinner was curry.  Going to have to double cook a couple of batches after holiday to restock the freezer\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that has lasted you a while, that's good.\\
Just finished book worming. How's your evening been?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Its been ok. Really dont get a lot of time after spin by the time I have eaten and showered. Been looking at some robot math.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Pretty early finish for the book worms\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It is a late one for you on Tuesdays.\\
I missed our bake off day today\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I haven't watched it so we can catch up\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i missed it as well\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I had to cook my own dinner :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We'll have to do a double-feature\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: possibly a triple as we will miss next week as well\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Omg I forgot about that!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: A bake off marathon\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I would say we could watch it out there but it will be locked to UK and I dont have a VPN\\

Did you sleep well?\\I am sleepy today :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\I'd be happy to go if you wanted to see him. Could make a weekend out of it. But very much 50\/50 on it too :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Slept ok. Bit better than yesterday.\\
I’ve told my mum to see about tickets. Hotel is about £100.\\Easy to do nothing so we might as well do something\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: DRUGS\\
Do you want me to pick them up and drop off when I’m on my way back?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Brill! It will be lovely to have something planned\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh where are you going?\\
I've planned to walk over during lunch. It will be good to get out and move a little. But thank you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok.\\
I’ve got an art show meeting this morning and then will see parents.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah yes!\\
Sorry, brain is a bit overloaded\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: made it back home. Done a bit of work. Hows your day been?\\
All ready for swimming?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was the art group meeting? And how are the parentals?\\
Day's been busy as per :face-with-tears-of-joy: but went to pick up meds\\Haven't finished yet so haven't even thought about swimming yet\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Art meeting was good. Bit too much redundant chat but we got stuff sorted.\\
Parents are good. Some new drama with Nan's house which is a pain. Back in 1999 Grandad bought the freehold but the solicitor didn't files the last bit of paperwork so it looks like the house still has a lease. Even though it doesn't. So its extra paperwork. Might have to do probate which could add 6 months to the whole pain thing. Plus there is still some faff in the council paying for Nan's care. All very annoying as 6 people had looked at the house but they have stopped the auction now until the freehold stuff is fixed.\\Stupid agents could have found all of this out months ago if they did there job right but only found out now.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh that is utterly frustrating. I'm sorry you guys are having to deal with all of this.\\
What are the next steps?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Need to get some legal people to fix it and then start again while keep hounding the council to pay the money they owe.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh god, a lot of work\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: and just a lot of faff as other people need to do it all and it will just all cost more money.\\
Half funny is that Mum had just worked out what all the money would be spent on and it all looked good. In terms of sorting out nan's care and the building for mark\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I hope it doesn't take ages and ages and people are competent.\\
What are you up to tonight?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Got nerd group tonight. Will start to plan out the new robot or play around with some code for the current robot.\\
I think I’m still missing something around the basics of motor control.\\You all set for swimming now?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah yes, it's the bi monthly on a different day one, isn't it?\\
Yes, all dressed and ready to go. It's raining\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah. It second Wednesday and 4th Thursday.\\
Good luck. Leave some of the pool for others to drink this week.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I hope it goes better and won't get as frustrating\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You’ll get it.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's nerd group going?\\
I didn't drown\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It’s going ok. Bit more lively this week.\\
That’s really good, would have been a right pain if you did. Not sure I could get a refund now:rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:. Did it feel better this week?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Glad it's more lively. Hope you're having a good evening.\\
It felt good the first half and then spluttering towards the end :upside-down-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to head to bed.\\

Enjoy the office.\\You get to set your office tomorrow.\\“Thank you for your email. I’m away. It has been automatically deleted. I am back on XX. Please resend your request once I am back. Have a blessed day”\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That's a big group! Glad it was good.\\
:face-with-tears-of-joy: Might not include the deleted part\\What's the plan after gym?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: The deleted bit is the best part, although I was never brave enough to do it.\\
Food next then my uni tutorial work. Check what uni stuff I need to take with me and maybe some mouse stuff later in the day.  Should be a fun day.\\Already worked out what math I need to use. Also got a “drop in” session later which should be good as I actually have a question.\\Hope the office goes well. You’ll smash it. Figuratively obviously.

\textbf{Paul Busby}: we are checked in! :partying-face:\\
Sorry but there were no seats at all any where near the front of the plane. The system put us back of the bus. I moved us a little just to see if we can maximise getting a whole row. Planes looks very full\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not needed but if you have the british airways app you will be able to get a copy of your bording pass. I have already printed them but I always like options.\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thanks. As Hannah has correctly pointed out. I now need to do the work so people can see it. That will be the extra focus after holiday. A good 8 weeks before xmas to actually make progress on dropping some weight\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just in case you were worrying. I have a hard copy of boarding pass, hotel voucher and the 2 vouchers for each of our taxi trips.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That is a very good plan :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: and being on holiday also doesn't mean we can't make good choices with food and movement :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I love you :face-blowing-a-kiss:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not sure what mobile plan you have but I just bought 7GB for spain as an esim \url{https://mobimatter.com/}\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: Where have the girls gone on holiday?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just some chocolate nuts and gummy sweets\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll be alright with podcasts and music :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Athens\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just logged off :exploding-head:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Later than you wanted then?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: All done now. Holiday mode :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: What was confusing\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Don’t forget to pack your vibrator\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Why? I thought you were coming too :face-blowing-a-kiss:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well yes but sometimes I like using them on you.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know. But I don't have one for couples play to be honest\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How about that little one you got?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ve very curious about what you must have but I do have that small one I can bring\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Womaniser it's called\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh it’s a sucker one\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yah\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How’s the packing going? Feels like it never ends. I’ve stopped to hunt for dinner. Thinks it’s all there. Just needs to make its way into the case\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm feeling literally the same.\\
Do I have too much? Am I missing something?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: The joke is all you really need is passport, drugs and a lt least a few clothes. Everything else can be sorted.\\
Sunglasses and books keep coming to my mind.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've got those\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Phone charger and EU adaptor is the only next important thing on the list.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Got those too\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think I might have too much as usual\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Same.\\
4 changes of clothes for each day?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Breakfast, day time, dinner, sex time and sleep time. Maybe 5 per day then :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: I would guess you but we will see. I may be overpacking gym stuff\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How many times are you going to the gym?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think based on what I’ve packed 4 times a day :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
I’ve got 5 shirts I think.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy::face-with-tears-of-joy:\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: You’ll get there. Joking aside you don’t need to go mad.\\
Couple of dinner outfits and the stuff for the pool x7 couple of extra tops.\\No need to go mad on shoes. Trainers for the plane. Maybe something smart if you want. I just have trainers and then something to wear by pool \/ beach.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm not going mad at all.\\
I don't know what you mean by dinner outfits but I have couple of dresses\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That is what I meant\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Dinner outfits = clothes to be worn for dinner. Which generally means not swim wear.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I didn't know if you meant a ball gown?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not this time but that would of course count as a dinner outfit. <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I think I'm done. Just wash bag to put in in the morning\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Mega fancy packing cubes.\\
You might have less stuff than me and or your cloths have a lot less material\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't know whether that's tru :face-with-tears-of-joy:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Although I have just noticed you have a whole top bit that looks full as well\\

Can do chickpea curry for dinner?\\I’ll get the name of the place but it’s just up the road from Marks.\\Oh well done. Does sorting out mean got rid of some or do you now know how much you have?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Why would I be getting rid of yarn??????? :exploding-head:\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: Stellar Tutorial 1.docx • 1 page <attached: 00025639-Stellar Tutorial 1.docx>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Solid plan! Up to anything tonight?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Some food. And rest. So revolutionary :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I would like to have a look at some robot stuff but not sure what form that will take. Plus i have one more bake off to watch.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: its a unique plan for sure :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Some words make sense separately .Together no sense\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Get that bake off watched :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What do you fancy for dinner tomorrow?\\
Risotto, greek Mac and cheese, yummy soup, or something else?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Risotto would be good. With peas :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Risotto with peas it is :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It appears that I am a muppet. Just got an email from the course leader asking me if everything is alright as I hadn't done my exam. Cue mad panic on my part as I discover that I completely missed a submit button that you are meant to press. :man-facepalming::man-facepalming::man-facepalming::man-facepalming:\\
Hopefully they can see that I did actually upload the exam within the time limit but will have to see.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: OMG :face-screaming-in-fear::face-screaming-in-fear::face-screaming-in-fear::face-screaming-in-fear::face-screaming-in-fear::face-screaming-in-fear::face-screaming-in-fear:\\
Did you respond and submit?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: yeah, I've hit the submit button and replied to her email. Will just have to see what they say now. In theory they can see when I uploaded the document which would prove i did the exam within the time frame.\\
Its about right for me to mess up the easiest bit of the whole exam.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good. Hopefully they will let it through as just the first exam :crossed-fingers-light-skin-tone::crossed-fingers-light-skin-tone::crossed-fingers-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think I should be ok. The PDF file I submitted has a created date on it and I just email to say I can show a GitHub check-in history to show I haven't modified the file after the time limit. Just a bunch of faff I have caused for people. Urgh!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It will be okay. You've shown proof that you have done it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m sure it will be fine. Just an unnecessarily silly mistake on my part.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well you'll know for the next one :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Won’t make the mistake again\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: You'll submit three times from now on\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did you get some robot stuff done?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Not yet. Watching bake off.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Why does it feel like it's 11 o'clock :grinning-face-with-sweat:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, time change plus you were up early.\\
Plus if you think it’s 11 you are very late to bed :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am very late to bed as is :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And this headache is getting into a full blown migraine\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh no that’s no good.\\
You’re really suffering this last 10 days or so. :face-with-head-bandage:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Honestly. Just put me in the bin\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also, paired :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: My bin was just collected so I think there would be complaints if my bin was making noises for a week. Need a different plan :red-heart:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well I'll just have to wait I guess\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: All tucked in.\\

Head is banging and have been in since like 7.15 :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\How are you? What's the plan for today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Urgh that sucks. How come so early? was that planned.\\
Mainly uni work today, just churning through the lectures. Then I've got spin at 6 and will do the awful stairmaster before that.\\Will you get some TOIL out of today?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just needed to get bits ready. Still didn't have enough time before they started turning up.\\
But after awful stairmaster you have lovely Lucy :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\Yes, Amanda is very good with pushing me to take the time back\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: At least its all up and running now. Good luck with the rest of the day.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am up and definitely running, yes :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: good news. They will accept my exam. They can see all the timestamps are within the time limit.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah brilliant!! So glad it's sorted <This message was edited>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The advent calendar I wanted sold out :loudly-crying-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: OH NO that's a real pain. Will it come back in stock? Its only October!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Probably not\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :loudly-crying-face: is there only one place to get it from?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup.\\
Ah well\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just getting home\\
17.6k steps\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Fucking hell. You’ve done more exercise than me.\\
Just got home. Will speed shower and come over. Assuming that still ok?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Of course it is :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes: I'm just about to start prepping dinner\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Can I be a pain. Can you log it all in the tracker thing so I can copy it later.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll see what I can do\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: On the way\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yay\\

Slightly calmer but already in back to back meetings :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\Did you sleep well?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Urgh.\\
Slept ok, slow this morning. Need to eat breakfast. Maybe will do the bike at lunch.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sometimes we need slow mornings\\
What's the plan for today?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Also, spud is still not my friend today :loudly-crying-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Really. How so. He seemed ok when I left. That is really holding a grudge for a wet neck.\\
After breakfast will be more uni work. Got to batch some lunches.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: He's really not happy about the smelly tincture. Been licking himself constantly\\
Good luck with uni bits :smiling-face:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You’ll have to explain to him that if he ate the tablet this wouldn’t happen\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Only if it were that easy :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Are you feeling any different today?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I am broken :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: and still have the bloody migraine\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Still! That’s a 2 day migraine\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Do you think you need to book an appointment? It’s been a while since you have been this consistently broken. Been a good 10 days if not 2 weeks of being quite bad.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I can bring dinner to you if that is better?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll have a look\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Since Sunday :upside-down-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I will try to book a review but I know they are just going to say what they do always. It's a chronic condition, you have to learn to manage it and live with it :face-with-rolling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: so a 4 day one\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: As you would say to me. If you just assume the answer no progress will be made. Yes they might say the same thing but there could be a time where they say something else.\\
I'm not sure "Live with a migraine" is the right answer for a doctor to give.\\Maybe an MRI or something. Multiple day migraines are new for you. Certainly not had that in the last 6 months\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That is very true. I might try to find out about how to go about this through Bupa\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good plan. Private should be more efficient at getting something done\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm going to have a quick nap and see if that helps\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: breaking that streak :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
good luck\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did the nap help?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I mean I've napped and then snoozed :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: definitely needed it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That's something at least\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Would you like a pretty notebook for writing stuff down?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: because you already have one or buying?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Because I got two from work :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Woo Hoo, yes please\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha okay\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Still good for 6?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, just going to jump in the shower\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Great, I;m about to do the same. Not sure where the day has gone really\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Mum is going back to Costco on Friday if you want anything?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you but I'm alright :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Leaving in 2\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Home!\\

I'm so sorry you're not feeling well.\\Have a slow morning if you can. What's the plan for today?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just started a workout. Will eat then uni work for the day plus a batch cook of the beef. Will see what I can get done. I’m sure life admin is going to get in the way as well.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope the workout is good. Don't push it too much if you're not feeling great\\
:face-blowing-a-kiss:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: GOOD LORD THE COUNCIL ARE SHIT. they have denied my council tax claim because they said my course is part time. Which isn't criteria they use to say if you get exception or not. Another 20 days before I get a response :man-facepalming:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh of course - it's only for full time courses isn't it. That's so shit\\
What did you tell them?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've had my jabby jab\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done on getting stabbed.\\
After I wanted to tell the council to jump off a bridge. I have pointed out that this \url{https://www.gov.uk/council-tax/discounts-for-full-time-students}\\Says nothing about the course being full or part time and states you only need to be studying more that 21 hours. Which I am. Plus the course is 2 years long.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well hopefully they will give you the extension\\
My arm will fall off\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Does your arm hurt?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes :confused-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: The nurse proper went for it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m afraid to ask how a nurse “went for it” with a flu jab but I’m sorry you suffering more now.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just jabbed me full force :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
I've got you a little cute insulated coffee mug\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I just have this vision now of a nurse doing some sort of running head start needle in hand ready to stab.\\
OH nice. More swag :red-heart:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Exactly!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh Nice, That is cute (like you)\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aw thaanks :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm making a proper proper chicken soup and it already smells so nice\\
What time is nerd group?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hope it’s good. Not sure I’ve ever made chicken soup before.\\
7:30 tonight.\\You won’t believe it but I just had a nap. Knackered today.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh my gaaaaawd :exploding-head::exploding-head::exploding-head::exploding-head::exploding-head: a nap? And I pulled an all dayer. The tables have turned.\\
Are you feeling better for it?\\The soup is so yum\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m feeling a little less tired :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\

\textbf{Paul Busby}: What weird answer did you give to paired. A question mark.\\

Will force me to be somewhat sensible tonight\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I didn't know that was happening\\

I'm actually leaving now :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: it was so hot and uncomfortable in the office today. 12k steps\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I've got stuff done and there is time for me to sort what i need to sort.\\

I'm not sure. It's been a big week which wouldn't have helped.\\Have a good walk\/run\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: \url{https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGdRTDckv/}\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Brilliant. Some are awful but that’s a good one\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was parkrun?\\

She should be on the 12 o'clock train and then we'll drive over to Maidenhead\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thanks, much more human now food has been had.\\

How’s the spa?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Say hello to parents.\\
Spa was lovely. Just finishing up the afternoon tea and then will start heading back.\\When are you off out?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m getting picked up just after 6. I guess will be in Marlow about 7.\\
If your finishing early you could always pop up if you wanted to say hello?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Where are you going for dinner?\\
I probably won't pop round, I've got wet hair and all.\\Look at you, two outings in a day\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think we are just grabbing something at the weather spoons. Apparently everyone else was out last night as well and are all hanging so it could be a very early night tonight :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Will just have to see.\\I KNOW, it too many and I haven't seen you. 3 outings within basically 24 hours. Next few weekends should be a lot calmer.\\Are we going to see each other tomorrow? There is a race on at 5pm and I would like a bit of a lie in but the clocks go back so that will help.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I KNOW TOO. You're having two dates and neither is with me :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
We could. I might go for a swim and I definitely need to clean the flat as haven't had a chance since we got back\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I'm not going on dates:rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
That feels like a no, if you need the day to just chill and get jobs done.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Sure :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
I would love to see you but the flat is stressing me out. I could pop for a coffee and cuddle after swimming?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’m not going on dates.\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It was good but longer than intended :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
What have you been up to?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ve done a bit of sitting, some washing. Little bit of computer but brain is slow.\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Do you have snacks for later?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have a few snacks. Trying to keep the snacks calm\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha good plan. Maybe we can figure some nice healthy ones?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Maybe, not sure what they could be. I did used to like those super low calorie crisps\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We can brainstorm on Tuesday :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ready from vroom vroom? Where is it today?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just about ready yeah. Its mexico today\\

I loved seeing you this morning\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I loved seeing you as well and thank you again for breakfast.\\
Have you any thoughts beyond Tuesday on use seeing each other?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What are your plans for the week?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: In terms of evenings this week I’ve got nothing beyond what we are doing on Tuesday.\\
I have Martin starting for to finish the front on Friday and I have Hannah Wednesday morning instead of Friday but other wise that it’s. Obviously got uni to do.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Found the muppet mistake. Next weeks race is at 5pm\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've got Steph on Tuesday and then bake off with you.\\
Laura is hosting a musical bingo on Wednesday if you fancy it? I was thinking it might be nice to go support\\And then nothing really. Would love to go to Marlow market on Saturday\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aaaaaah\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: We can do that. Do you have details for Wednesday?\\
What time is the market as I was thinking I’ll parkrun first\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've just asked Laura but I think 8?\\
Market is 10-2, I was thinking about parkrun first too\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok. Hope it finished on time :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
Oh Boo for cancelled spin.\\Did you sleep well?\\Not shin splints?\\I'm alright. A bit tired and achy. could definitely do with an extra day. What time is Hannah?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Slept pretty good. I was fighting to make it to bed. Missed the last 5 laps of the race. Nearly spent the whole night on the sofa by mistake.\\
Don’t think it’s shin splits. Feels like the muscle. We did sumo’s on Friday or I walked like an absolute muppet at park run.\\Got Hannah at 8.\\You know that you could take an extra day….\\It’s only an email or phone call away.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah well done for not falling asleep on the sofa.\\
Ah yeah, the sumos combined with PR would do it\\I know, but just don't have the extra annual leave and I do have half day on Friday\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I was more meaning that you could phone in sick.\\
Friday is a long way away.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: See how I feel tomorrow :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Actually, I'm going to work from home :grinning-face-with-sweat:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Good plan.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hope the gym is good!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was good but knackering. Proper struggle again. Got to failure though so that had to be good.\\
Hope work is calm for you today. You planning a nap?\\Drink more water :droplet:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well done for smashing it!\\
What's the plan for rest of the day?\\It should be. I have some bits to finish off from last week and one meeting. I've taken a little one already so will see what lunch brings\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Mainly uni work today. Got to get stuff finished for a tutorial tomorrow.\\
Maybe see about doing the bare minimum today.\\Do you have book club or any after work activities. <This message was edited>\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good luck with it. Hope you get everything done.\\
I'm taking it easy. I don't know why but it just slapped me in the face this morning. I was all dressed and ready to go and then suddenly I wasn't.\\Just need to do a food shop and drop Agi's bits at hers\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I had to read that multiple times. I read it that you had slapped yourself :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Good luck\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you lunched and napped?\\
More water\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I have done all three :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
How's your day going?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I got confused as to why I was hungry and then checked the time :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
So having lunch now\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That is a late one!\\
What are you having?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Was omelette today.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Did you get your bits done?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I've got stuff done, so that's good. Just ordered 10 more of those curries.\\
Hows your day been, are you done now?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Are there options for dinner tomorrow. Rissotto and mac and cheese were lasts weeks and either would work. I'm not sure I fancy soup for dinner\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh nice. I still have some different ones at home too.\\
Write off of a day :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: plodded along with some work but didn't get much done\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: there are days like that. The world still spins and it will be there tomorrow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I'm going to go in tomorrow as I've got 1 meeting that would be better f2f\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: you can always go home after the meeting?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Probably\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Have you had a think about what you want for dinner tomorrow?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: i asked you that a little while ago\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: needs to be sofa safe\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I did not see that :grinning-face-with-sweat::woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I made Mac and cheese yesterday\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: or is curry an option\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: so not this?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: There's leftovers :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Your favourite :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
I like the risotto or a curry or some sort of pasta thingy\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: not really done pasta for a while\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've just had that yesterday and today :grinning-face-with-sweat:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki, let me have a think. Not sure my muddled brain will come up with something\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: maybe not pasta then as you've had that 2 days in a row\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'll see if inspiration hits me while food shopping\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you survived outside and shopping?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Barely. Just finishing up at Aldi. How's your afternoon been?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you go to Agi's first then.\\
Afternoon has been ok. THe uni stuff was a bit confusing so will have to go over again\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes just popped up quickly.\\
Is the unit much harder now?\\I haven't figured out dinner yet for tomorrow :confused-face:\\Meatballs with mash? Risotto? Curry?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It is harder but it’s also some of the hard math from last year that I find difficult.\\
Meatballs.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully revision and working it over will help.\\
Meatballs it is\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Tucked in.\\
Night night x x x x x x x x x x x x\\Sleep well. Look forward to seeing you tomorrow\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hope you sleep better\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x\\
How did you sleep?\\I did. Just finishing my meeting and will be heading home\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ahh well done. I'm all for meetings in person and its good you can just go home now.\\
Nap before lunch?\\Slept ok, which was nice. Just getting setup before my tutorial at 11:30 and trying to refine my notes from last week before I forget everything. Still not quite in the grove of sorting out future revision material\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, I'm glad I had it in person too. I'm still not used to getting so much praise :grinning-face-with-sweat:\\
Definitely nap\\Ah good you've had a good night. Hope the tutorial is good\\You'll get there with the notes. And I'm always here if you want help or bounce ideas\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well you obviously doing a really good job otherwise they wouldn't be giving you praise for it all and that is because you are brilliant and dedicated.\\
Enjoy the nap.\\Drink WATER :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How was tutorial?\\
I just got up 15mins ago :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone::woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: It was helpful. So that good.\\
Whoops. I think you need it though.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah that's good! Working on your uni bits now?\\
It feels like I did\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, working through the new weeks worth of stuff. It all about how stars works which is super interesting. Just lot and lots of equations that all mix together.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: "A free electron passing a neutral H atom can induce a dipole moment in the atom, and can bind to the proton, forming a "H" 	extrm− ion."\\
AHH yes, so obvious, so clear, so probable :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::loudly-crying-face::loudly-crying-face:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't even know what this means :grinning-face-with-sweat:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I've just been looking it up. Had to pause the lecture and everything :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
It just one of a couple of insanely silly sentences that has happened today.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm not surprised! It would take me a week to even understand that sentence\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What it should say is that very very rarly hydrogen will accept a second electron and for some reason this can make a star more opaque but hydrogen fucking hates being in this state so it won't stay like that for long\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Bloody hydrogen\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: exactly!\\
We still ok for later?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hopefully Steph won't kill me\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: lets hope so. I have nothing defrosted for dinner :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
I'm sure you'll smash it\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh we wouldn't want you to not have dinner :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: and that's just the tip of the ice burg of troubles I'd have if Steph killed you. There would be the whole emotional devastation, what to do with Spud etc. Nightmare.\\
AND I'd still have to find food\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
The whole emotional devastation :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Before I forget. Are we eating at Laura's thing tomorrow or should I eat first?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: We should eat first. I don't know if there's food\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: As in we should eat together or separately, i'd thought seperate? I now have a call at 5pm for uni\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Separate bub. I'll pick you up at like 10 to 7?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: great\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Toria is with Hannah and didn't see me saying hello again :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Good luck with the sesh <This message was edited>\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Did you survive? Just got home. Will shower and be on my way.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Barely. Just about to shower too\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done for getting it done\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
Hope spin was good\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Proper struggle. I did forget my watch and I think not seeing my heart rate messed me up. Plus the stair master is just horrific\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh bub\\
But you did it! Even though it sucked. Well done\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: What happened with paired! I thought we’d had that question already.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I was going to ask the same!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I didn't answer today but it just came up with that\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hmm I just edited it and it doesn’t think I’ve answered today\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Mine doesn't either\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Streak freeze will get used I guess\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Boooooo\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Leaving now\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yaaaaay\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Home,\\
Thank you again for dinner.\\Good luck with the speed pottering.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you for coming and making yarn cakes with me :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yarn cakes are fun :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
I’ve made it to bed so will wish you good night\\Night night x x x x x x x x x x x x\\Hope you sleep well and get a bit of a lie in.\\Love You :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm tucked in too.\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
I'm okay, I think they will properly hit tomorrow.\\How did you sleep? Ready for gym?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Delayed ones are annoying.\\
Slept ok but feel like garbage. Nothing specific just very low grade urgh. I hope I’m not catching something as I do not have the time to be sick.\\Otherwise all ready for the gym. I have no idea what it will be today. I think maybe squats.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I'm sorry you're feeling all meh. Loads of water today :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
Enjoy the sesh\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: <attached: 00026003-GIF-2024-10-30-07-35-27.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: exactly!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :loudly-crying-face::loudly-crying-face::face-vomiting:\\
That was all a mega struggle and a half. Thought I was going to throw up at one point. Think the body is fighting something\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh bub. I'm sorry it was so hard. It does sound like you might be coming down with something.\\
What's the plan for today? Can you make it easier? Loads of fluids and maybe some paracetamol?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Plan for today is uni and that can be as easy or as hard as I make it. Will be going mental on fluids. Hopefully breakfast will help. Just super low energy compared to my normal and can’t even blame the sleep.\\
How’s your day looking?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ok, make sure you take it easy and take care of yourself.\\
Do you want me to make you some chicken soup?\\I've got nothing in the diary so will be just slowly catching up on bits\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s great you have a slow day.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How are you feeling?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: a little wonky. Very slight fog.\\
Would it be terrible if I \/ we cancelled bingo?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Please do rest.\\
I might still go if agi will bit not sure. Don't worry if you're not feeling up for it\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: i worry :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think its a good idea if I do cancel tonight, sorry.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki, don't worry :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
Are you feeling yucky? Do you need anything?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I've showered so not super yucky just more urgh and slow.\\
Possible not helped by the video I am watching where it is discussing the energies needed for nuclei to quantum tunnel in order to smash together :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\On the plus side my deliveries for Friday have arrived.\\How's your slow day gone \/ going?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah that's not going to help the brain.\\
The building materials?\\Slow day is slow. I haven't done much but have had some training videos on.\\I think I'm still going to go tonight. You rest up and hope it doesn't carry over to tomorrow.\\Do you need anything?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Building materials for the patio work out the front for Friday.\\
That's a good day but I can imagine training videos can be dull.\\Really hope it doesn't carry over but will see. Will try for a much earlier bed time than normal.\\Thank you but I think I have everything I need.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ok, but let me know if I can do anything.\\
Leeeeet meeeeee taaaake caaaaare of youuuuuuu\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
If there is something I will let you know\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hmm, I thought I just had a good idea but you will quickly spot why it is stupid.\\
I was about to say if this could be helpful for you \url{https://stockedfood.com/}\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Frozen blocks?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: yep\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Looks like a risky amount of onion for me\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: In answer to paired. Yes :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing::rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: Or it means you did a whole bunch of teenage rebellion that you dont want to relive\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah well. Probably just boring :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Your not boring\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Aw thanks :smiling-face-with-hearts:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How did the drop in go?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Still going but useful\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh long today\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Deal: Walking Pad with Incline, 4 in 1 Under Desk Treadmill, 2.5HP Walking Treadmills for Home \& Office, Walking Pad with Remote Control, LED Display\\
\url{https://amzn.eu/d/asveyEp}\\I've got £300 to spend on the wellbeing grant, already having the swimming refunded so was thinking maybe this? What do you think?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You have £300 left or in total?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 300 left\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You would need a standing desk :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not for working\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: oh, for when?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Walking when watching TV etc\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: The one you links looks fine. I think the incline is a manual thing and not automatic from the picture.\\
They are probably quite big.\\Maybe a folding one \url{https://www.amazon.co.uk/WalkingPad-Walking-Foldable-Treadmills-Home/dp/B0CLS9N2GJ}\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Doesn't have incline :pensive-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: It has manual incline but seems like that would be more of a pain than a help\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: This one doesn't\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sorry, I mean the one you linked only has manual incline. Which could be a pain as its adjustable feet. Rather than it just easily laying flat on the floor\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: the one I sent has no incline\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: just flat\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: but it folds\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Any walking pad will be manual I think\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: yeah I think so as well. My thought would be that it will add to the faff factor in trying to use it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't think I'd mind\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What do you think then?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think the walking treadmill is a good idea. I'm not sure on the ones that have the inclines legs but you have a wooden floor so should be better than carpet. My biggest concern would be where it lives when not in use. I suspect you'd have to move the sofa to get it in front of the tv. Would need measuring first.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I thought it could live under the sofa?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I could also spend the money on a bike but I don't have anywhere to keep that\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: would need to measure to see if it will fit under the sofa. That's why I thought the folding one. Easier to store. I wouldn't assume it would fit.\\
I guess this money has to be spent on new stuff? So not as helpful for a bije as a new £300 bike will be naff \/ heavy\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I need an invoice.\\
There must be bikes under 300 that would fit the bill\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I think a bike would be better second hand as you'll get better value. No doubt you could buy one for 300 I just dont know how nice it would be\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That does make sense\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: There is the cycle shop in town where we could have a look if your not mega itching to get a treadmill\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: when are you going out?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Literally now\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What's the plan for you?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Dinner and sitting\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Good plan. Did you drink water today?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah I’ve drunk loads today.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Enjoy the bingo\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's really fun. Shame you couldn't come.\\
How are you feeling?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Glad it’s going well.\\
Just feeling slow and tired\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ive made it to bed.\\
Hope the evening has been fun and you get home safe. Let me know.\\Night night x x x x x x x x x x x x\\Annoyed I didn’t get to see you today.\\Love You :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night x x x x x x x x x x x\\

How was spin? How are you feeling?\\I speed pottered to bed but could not fall asleep for ages\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Spin was hard. All struggle. Felt pretty weak compared to normal but good to have got it done. Still feel a little bit spaced out.\\
So excited that your brain needed time to calm down :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\How’s your day looking?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well done for doing but hopefully it won't set you back\\
Honestly, took me hours.\\I have a meeting at Wycombe food hub for health and safety run through. We have the volunteering day there next week. So I'm going to walk down there to get some movement.\\And then a meeting in the afternoon, some admin in between.\\I've booked a swim for after work because I won't be able to go for at least a week or so after tomorrow.\\What's your plan?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I was about to ask why no swim but tattoo I guess.\\
Busy day for you then.\\Lester is coming round at 10 for a coffee. They just some uni work. Just going to focus on watching the lectures and see what sticks.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yup, stabby stab, no swim swim\\
Hope you have a good catch up with Lester.\\Are we seeing each other over the weekend?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I hope so. I thought we were doing park run\/walk and the Marlow market for a start.\\
What did you have in mind\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: What did you have in mind? :winking-face-with-tongue:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You can’t answer my question with the same question :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Plus I’ve no idea if you had stuff you wanted or needed to do this weekend?\\Obviously there is stuff :smiling-face-with-horns: I’d like us to do but that all depends on how we are feeling and I’d planned that tattoo, park run and market might completely wipe you out for at least Saturday.\\Dinner and something could be nice on Saturday. Trying to keep the dinner boring\/healthy\\The only thing I have this weekend is F1 @ 5pm (checked) on Sunday.\\We could try and get some stuff built in your flat on Sunday?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I can :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
That really sounds like a lovely plan. If I have a nap after market I should be alright. We could do dinner and a movie Saturday and some building on Sunday.\\What boring thing are you thinking for dinner?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sounds like a plan then.\\
Did you want to go from park run to the market? Were you planning on walking or running? I could drive.\\Not a clue for dinner. I was thinking steak or pizza as not had either for a while. Not sure if that’s is a sensible choice.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I can sort what ever dinner will be on the way back while you nap.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I was thinking I'd walk PR. I walked into town now and I'm dead :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
I was actually thinking steak too. We could do potatoes instead of chips? Or sweet potato? To make it slightly healthier. And I'll get myself some veg\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have those “healthy” chips, that aren’t terrible. Can either get steak from Lidl in Marlow or after I drop you off.\\
I’ll walk as well then. Means less spicy to then walk around the market.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah we can pop to Lidl on the way back in Marlow :smiling-face:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How are you doing?\\
The DOMS have definitely arrived, I can barely move :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh no that's not good. Maybe the swim will help?\\
I'm doing ok. Lester was here for a couple of hours. Cooked and then had lunch and have been trundling through some uni stuff. Found a new feature of chat GPT which looks cool but sometimes it acts more like your dumb stubborn friend than a smart friend helping.\\They have a new collaborative feature so it can work on a document of code more interactively.\\How's the work been going?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm really hoping it will help.\\
Did you have a good catch up? What did you have for lunch?\\Haha, that's a brilliant description. Hope it does help you out.\\I haven't done much tbh, just little bits. I'm not very productive this week\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Very nice to catch up. I think we are going to try and go out next weekend as well. Probably just into town, if you want to join us?\\
What ChatGPT does seem good for it bouncing stuff off. Pointing out where and how it is wrong I think helps with the learning\\That sounds like a brilliant week at work. Its not meant to be mega mental all the time. Just keeping things ticking over is great\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I did my turkey mince thingy for lunch. GOing to flip flop between than and an omelette for the time being\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Glad you had a good time.\\
When are you thinking? I'm in Oxford during the day on Saturday.\\I know you're supposed to have quieter times but my brain still struggles with thinking I'm not being a good employee if I'm not constantly busy\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: That sounds good!\\
What are you up to this evening?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: The planning has merely entered the stages of possibility so the current thinking is that maybe next weekend Lester and I will go out somewhere :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:.\\
Most of the time work is meant to be very manageable and not manic. I know teaching was manic ALL the time because eating and sleeping really got in the way of EVEN more paperwork that should have been done but normal work shouldn't be like that.\\Your meant to just get done what can be done within the time and the rest bounces to tomorrow, later or never.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: What are you in oxford for?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have no idea but not much. Keeping it quite today. Probably some games and try for early bed as Martin the building guy is aiming to be here at 7:30\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haha okay. Well let me know when you have some more details\\
Logically I do know that. I'm just still recovering from teaching, it will take more time\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Haven't seen Romana since she had her little bub so probably just lunch and catch-up\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Quiet is good\\
How are you feeling now?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Be more calm faster :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh nice.\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Still feeling a bit off. Not bad, just off. Like I know my brain isn't where it normally is.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh bub. Do you need anything? I can drop stuff off after swim\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I'm ok thanks. Been drinking lots of water and I defrosted food. So that all ready for me. Thank you though. You need your rest as well\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know! But it's my job to take care of you when you're poorly!!!!!\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Bub have you thought about Spud-sitting availability while I'm away?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: So the 17th Nov to the 22nd?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I can check on him\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yes, but if you need me to get someone for when you have your exam etc let me know\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I can do the 17th to the 22nd. If you can get cover for the 23rd that would be good as that's when i'll do my exam\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Sorry I can't read\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: 22nd you will need someone as that is my exam. So I can do Sunday 17th to the Thursday 21st\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you bub :smiling-face-with-hearts: really appreciate it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's proper hoa hoa weather outside :beaming-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have no idea what that is but i'm assuming spooky somehow. Even google has failed me\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: More like foggy and spooky. Love it!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Hope the swim goes well\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Swim was frustrating again. But I did swim much further. Just drank half the pool again\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done for getting it done and that sounds like an improvement. Plus you left everyone with half a pool.\\
Do you know where about in the stroke you inhaling all the water?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It was so lovely and quiet. Had a whole lane to myself most of the time.\\
It's when I'm turning to breathe and apparently also when I'm breathing out which I don't know how that can be happening\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Do you breath out through mouth or nose?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I try through nose only but sometimes mouth creeps in\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And most of the time I overcompensate with my legs and today it felt like they were doing nothing\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: “creeps in”\\
Maybe you need to start turning your head sooner so it’s just before the end of the exhale.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Or start the breath out later but in theory your meant to “breath normally”\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: More practice and you’ll get it. I know it took Marks ages to get comfortable with it\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Yeah I have to practice and try not to get discouraged and frustrated\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Just got to keep going.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: <attached: 00026130-GIF-2024-10-31-18-46-27.mp4>\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your evening been?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Been ok, just been playing a game. Will go to bed soon.\\
Have you recovered from your swim?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hah no. Just been making cakes on the couch :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing: will potter to bed soon\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How many cakes have you done?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 6-7?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ha, nice. Was spud helping or just looking funny at all the wool\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hunting the wool and being too distracted to sleep. The fireworks are not helping tbh\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just about to get tucked in.\\
Night night x x x x x x x x x x x x x x\\Hope you sleep well and feel better tomorrow.\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Aww, poor spud.

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
No, slow morning today.\\Oh bub, that's annoying. Do you have any cold meds? I do if you need them\\I'm achey and tired. Couldn't sleep again last night\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Slow morning is good but not so good on how you’re feeling.\\
Yeah I have cold stuff.\\Guys are here and getting started.\\You all ready for stabby stabby?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I'm working this morning and stabby stabby is at 12\\
Hope the work is good and quick.\\What's your plan for the day?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you worked out what stabby will be?\\
Just about to have some breakfast and then will do some uni. Probably not going to go mad today but got some stuff in my mind I want to do.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Of course, that's been decided for months :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
Have an easy day. Loads of liquid, drink some tea with honey too for the throat.\\And let me know if you need anything!!\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: In fairness most of my days are easy but that is the plan. Stupid virus.\\
Looks like I have enough cold meds for today but might hit you up for a box tomorrow or if needed get some in Marlow.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I've got enough if you need more for the weekend. Or I can pick up bits on my way from town\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I’ve got stuff for today and I have shopping arriving Sunday morning.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oki. Well it's here if you need it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Thank you.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's the building work going?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I haven't looked out side for a while. Been in office but will be getting lunch soon.\\
You all done and set for getting stabbed\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Just about to arrive. See how many crying voice notes I'll send you :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: VOICE NOTES!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I like that the pic is blurry. Enjoy :red-heart:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Half way there :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Oh wow, quite quick then.\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: All done!\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done. As long as you thought or quicker\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Quicker :smiling-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s good. How was \/ is the pain?\\
Are you pleased with it?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Afternoon off now\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Pain was actually absolutely fine. Might have dozed off for a second :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
I'm super pleased with it. Love it.\\How's your day going?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: DOZED OFF :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
So you can't sleep in a comfy bed with a blanket etc but a hard old hospital bed while being stabbed is absolutely fine\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Days going ok. Been working on making notes. The cough has arrived so I think I might be getting worse not better. Which is very annoying. Guys look to be doing a great job outside though\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I don't make the rules :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh bub. Do you need me to drop you something off?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No i'm ok, just annoyed. Plus you can't use the steps to my house :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ok but if you start feeling worse let me know and I can make you some chicken soup or something\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Wanna see?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: yeah, i'd assumed there would be some big revel tomorrow\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: or that it was all wrapped in cling film\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh it will still be wrapped up tomorrow\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Second skin\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: that's really cool\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: left arm?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Right\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: 50\/50\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hahaha\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I do love it\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: thats good :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And imagine how good that will look when my baby muscles pop :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: you already have baby muscles\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well when they grow up\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What are you plans now for the evening. I think I might go CRAZY and have a bath\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Well... I had a nap :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
But I'm just going to rest, make some cakes and watch some TV . Super rock n roll\\Have you had your bath yet?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Rock and roll indeed. That’s late for a nap.\\
In the bath now. I have no bubbles :man-facepalming:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I know but the stabby stabby did wipe me out.\\
Oh noooo. We can get you a bath bomb or two tomorrow :beaming-face-with-smiling-eyes:\\How are you feeling? Still wanting to parkwalk tomorrow?\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Feeling about the same. Very annoyed about the cough and throat. Yes to parkwalk\\
Martin is back at 7:30 anyway so I’ll be up\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh does he have bits to finish? How's it looking\\
I'm sorry you're still poorly. there's definitely a major lurgy going around\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Looks really good. He has the resin stuff to finish off. The tidy up work really.\\
Everyone seems to have something. Thought I was getting better not worse as it explains the struggles in the gym all week. Just could do with it done and no doubt it is now going to interfere with the weekend as well\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah I'm glad it's going well.\\
I think there's always that half up and dip before starting to get better. I know you're frustrated but just need to take your meds, drink loads and ride it out\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: You should take your own advice :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Snap on paired as well.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I do take my own advice!\\
I've been riding it out for 5 years :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: \url{https://prlotion.co.uk/}\\
Apparently this is a thing.\\Something else to try\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Hmm....\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Might be worth a try\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: What time shall I pick you up in the morning?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: 8.30? Or is that too late?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: We will make it. Depends if you want to  hit chat with people\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Would be nice to chat. Maybe 8.20?\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Ok, 8:20\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Thank you\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It feels like it's at least 10pm. So dark\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Yeah, not 7:45 :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: How's your evening been?\\
I'm just pottering to bed\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: its been ok. Not done much. Ended up watching "Finest Hour". Just pottering myself to bed. Got to change it :loudly-crying-face::loudly-crying-face::loudly-crying-face:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: How many cakes? Hows the arm\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh what's that about?\\
Can you change it tomorrow?\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: About 10 I think. I was proper caking :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
Arm feels alright, he did numb it at the end. Will see how the night goes\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: "Proper Caking" - LOL. Get a factory going.\\
Finest Hour is about Churchill and the first 3 weeks of WW2 and how he came to power, the choices he had to make all with the people around him against him.\\I might once again just change it tomorrow\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh I think I've heard about it.\\
My abs still hurt so much after Steph :woman-facepalming-light-skin-tone:\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Night night x x x x x x x x x x x\\
Sleep well and I hope you start feeling better\\Look forward to seeing you in the morning\\Love you :red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart::red-heart:\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: How many crutches were you doing. ab DOMS are some of the worst.\\

\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Morning x x x x x x x x x x x x\\
How are you feeling?\\Arm seems alright but I did wake up couple of times when I turned onto it\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Feeling a bit tired and sore throat. Not moved enough for the cough to wake up yet but I feel it there. Will just see how the days goes.\\
That must be a shock when you roll on it.\\\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: It's a little tender to the touch :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
I'm sorry this is lingering so long for you\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: I guess that expected with a tattoo has it helped shift any pain around or just added to more pain\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: On the way\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: I have your purse\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh yes! And a vape :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: Nope. Vape juice but no vape\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Ah yes\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You have the emotional support vape?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I do. I thought there was a different one in the bag\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: \url{https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14227048/?ref-=ext-shr-lnk}\\
Not Mark Ruffalo but found it\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Still on for 5?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I might run like 10-15mins late :grimacing-face: sorry, everything has just taken me longer\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: No prob. I just got out of the shower\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: You in cosies?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: I will be :face-blowing-a-kiss:\\

Thank you for a lovely evening and sorry I'm too wonky at the moment\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Well done.\\
You don’t need to be sorry for being wonky. I’m extra wonky as well at the moment.\\\textbf{Paul Busby}: Have you buttered?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: About to\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Oh the butter is so good. The tin I got is so so full and only needs a little to apply. And smells nice too\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s good. Can you feel it doing something?\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: Not just yet but I'm hoping by the time I get to bed it will ease the hips\\
\textbf{Paul Busby}: That’s good, hope it helps. All buttered\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And melatonined :rolling-on-the-floor-laughing:\\
\textbf{Lucy  Endrodyova}: And tucked in bed. Hope you're pottering towards it too\\
